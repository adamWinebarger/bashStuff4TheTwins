It's fun to destroy stuff in this game.  Blowing up whole towns just doesn't get old.  I don't know how successful this game was, but it seems it was underrated.  I rented it once and enjoyed it a lot.  The only problem I had with it was it got pretty difficult after finishing some of the easier levels, and I don't think there were all that many easy levels.
