The game is excellent. The plot is good. I mean, what can be better than a deadly poison killing people? But the graphics could have been infinitly better. The faces are flat, and have hardly any detail, and that is in the movie scenes! The graphics are esspecially bad in gameplay. The guns, well let me just say it leaves more to be desired. Blood is extremly fake looking, but there is tons of it! But the actual play itself is very fun.
Now for the sound. Music is okay. Gun fire sounds are awesome. But the one thing that could have been changed are the voice overs. As soon as one is finished speaking, the other one cuts in right away. Not a very big deal, but it wears on after awhile.
Graphics 3/10
Sound 7/10
