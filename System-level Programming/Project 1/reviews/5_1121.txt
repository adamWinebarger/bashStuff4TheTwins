I remember I was 6, and I had just gotten a Nintendo 64. At such a young age most of the games out were too complicated for me and I had to find something I could understand. Enter Mario Kart 64. This game is pure and simple, you pick a character and race with seven other famous Nintendo stars in 16 detailed (for N64, anyway) stages. This was one of the N64's first games, so for me it turned the system into a classic which I still play today.

  This game was much better than Super Mario Kart, and much better than Double Dash. In this game you can choose from 50cc - 150cc (which isn't much), and depending on your speed, this could be very boring, or the ride of your life. I mean seriously, who wouldn't want to speed down Yoshi Valley at 200 mph? For its time in '96, this game was amazing, and I still play it today. I am 15 now, so it has an enormous replay value. And the only stage I don't like is Banshee Boardwalk.

  If you have a Nintendo 64 (which not many people do), then buy this NOW!
