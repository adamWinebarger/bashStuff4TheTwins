The expansion pak will definitely enhance many of the newer N64 games (the differences I've seen on Episode I and SuperCross 2000 are very noticeable), but for the extra bit of eye candy I'm not sure this is worth  the money.  If you really enjoy crisper graphics, then go for it.. but I  think some people will find their money better spend elsewhere.
Another  thing to keep in mind is that the N64 is becoming dated.  The expansion pak  will help it a bit, but if you are planning to upgrade to a new system then  I would save your money.
