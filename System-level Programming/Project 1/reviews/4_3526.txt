This didn't have the best plot as the other res do, but was a hell of alot challanging. Your Claire Redfield looking for your brother Chris Redfield. You meet Steve Burnquist who eventually dies im sorry to say. I don't wanna spoil any more but anyway, Your main goal is to survive on the umbrella base owned by Miss Veronica. She is the master of all the ashfords which are a family of very wealthy people. Youll meet Alexia and Alfred. They are deadly so becareful. The graphics are the best part. Youll see a world of reality when you first see the first fmv. The Plot is good but not the best. And the handgun you get as your first weapon, lol sux. But you will not be dissapointed when you first turn the game on. You also will play as Chris Later in the game so have fun while the game lasts.
