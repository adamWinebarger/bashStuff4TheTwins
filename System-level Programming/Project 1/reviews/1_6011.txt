This controler stinks.  The joystick is messed up and turned at a slight angle (so you have to go slightly up and right to go straight up), the rubber grips fall off in the first week, and worst of all, it's confusing.  I tried programing the buttons (because it's "fully programable") and believe it or not it works!  sure you can't train whole sets of commands (like moves in fighting games) in, only replot the buttons but it works.  The only problem comes in when you accidently press the clear button with a light in it and all of the sudden, none of the buttons perform the X action.  Then, this controller will probably be unplugged and sent to the attic just like mine.  Enjoy!:(
