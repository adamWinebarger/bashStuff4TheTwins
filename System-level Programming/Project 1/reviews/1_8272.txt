Another blast from my past.  No matter how far I got, I could never beat the game completely.  So i figured i'd change that by pairing it up many years later with the game genie and play the game.  Unfortunately, my copy of the game is so distorted from use and abuse, it can't be played.  What little visual I have on screen is just a pixelated blob.  Had the store I bought it from quality checked the item before they sold it online, then this would be a better review.  But, since it cost less than a box of chicken nuggets, I didn't bother and threw it away.
