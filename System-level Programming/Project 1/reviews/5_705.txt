If you liked Full Trottle and love LucasArts' games in general, you'll love this game. It's one of the funniest games I've ever played. The way all the charters talk hispanic is enough to me laugh out loud. Manny  Calavera is the most likeable anit-hero you'll ever have the pleasure to  control, in this fantastic Land of The Dead adventure game. Who said the  adventure games was dead. Grim Fandango proofs them all wrong...
