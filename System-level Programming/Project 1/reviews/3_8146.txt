A great N64 game in its own right although its a little too easy its still a fun game especially for kids. The game features a story mode which gives you the option of which levels to play and depending on how well you do you can unlock more levels in the next chapter, unlike traditional games where the level ends when you reach the goal the level only ends after you've eaten a certain amount of fruit. the game allows you to play as six colored yoshis as well as two special colored yoshis. Unfortunately as good as it is it still got a few faults for instance the story mode is way too short with only six chapters and two boss battles, though some of levels are super easy some of the latter levels are annoyingly difficult and the music can be incredibly annoying. While it's nowhere as good as Yoshi's Island, Yoshi's Story is still a pretty good N64 Game.
