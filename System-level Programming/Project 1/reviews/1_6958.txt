I bought this game at a fairly low price, and when I started playing, I was totally amazed - at the incredibly bad graphics.

 The game featured a basic HUD with two annoyingly large bars, placed above and below it. That was the first thing I noticed. Next I saw that the terrain was sort of fuzzy, and my gun wasn't all that impressive either.

 "OK...," I said to myself. "Why don't I try walking around and see if this gets any better?" So I did. Guess what? No gun sway! Every stinkin FPS game I've every seen had some sort of movement with the gun (Ok, maybe not Wolfenstein 3d, but still!).

 So, anyway, I tried firing the gun - barely any recoil at all. I tried a pistol just to see if the hammer would pull back but it did not.

 Anywayz terrible graphics = boring game. Enough said
