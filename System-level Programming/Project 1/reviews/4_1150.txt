When I first heard of a Mario Kart game comming out for Nintendo 64 I was overjoyed to realize that they would keep up on such an awesome Super  Nintendo game.  To my amazment, the game came to the 64 with nothing but  crisp graphics and pre-rendered characters abound.  However, where there  comes the good side of all this, there is a bad side; some of the  characters in the game, in fact, cheat to win.  Now I'm not sure why this  little feature was allowed, perhaps to make it more challenging or give us  more reason to throw the controller at the wall when Mario suddenly jumps  out in front of you.  However, you can master there cheating ways by  learning how to outwit them at their own game.  Find shortcuts and other  things that can aid you in your race for the finish.  From cheating to  graphics and music I must say that the graphics are quite impressive for  such a game made so early on.  The music is also amazing, with hummable  tunes that will get you in the mood to race, or the mood to hit Wario off  the side of a moutain just to here him scream.  The sure thing to do now is  to buy the game, because it is a classic and always will be.
