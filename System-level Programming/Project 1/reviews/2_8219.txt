Diddy Kong Racing, simply put, is a game I have tried to love, and simply cannot do it.  I have even tried to play it, but I cannot simply stand playing this insipid game.  I do now know why, but this simply is not a good game.  Perhaps it is particular tastes.  But I simply cannot stand this game.  The tracts are fairly imaginative.  One grating thing about it is say you hit a tree.  Well, instead of bouncing off like on many other racing games, you stay bashing into the tree.  It does have some interesting features, however.  The sheer volume of tracts (had it been any other game would have been a plus) shows ingenuity, the story line is interesting, but in execution the game just flails horribly.
Why do I give it 2 stars?  The concept.  I love the concept.  Making an adventure out of a racing game, and the format they gave it is an excellent idea.  The sheer number of tracks is exhilarating.  And on some courses there are THREE (plane, hovercraft, kart) types of vehicles to use.  It is just a tragedy that in practice it doesn't come off at all.  It is nowhere near Super Mario Kart 64.  That game is fast-paced and loads of fun, the best racer to hit the N64.  Size wise, this dwarves Mario Kart 64.  If they could have had the execution on Mario Kart 64 and the concept of Diddy Kong Racing, we would have had one hell of a game.  Sadly, such a game does not exist (yet).  We have to settle with a badly executed game (Diddy Kong Racing) with another racing game that is superb in all manner of ways.  But, with a little engineering, we could have the best of both worlds.  Super Mario Kart 64 is the way to go, folks.  The multiplayer battle is really fun too, especially Block Fort.  Superiour in concept, inferiour in execution.  That's the bottom line.
