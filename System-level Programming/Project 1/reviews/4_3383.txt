Being a diehard Final Fantasy fan, I just had to get this game.  While I enjoyed it for the most part, I was disappointed by the "feel" of the game for lack of a better term.  It was not fantasy, it was more science fiction, and I really could have done without the awkward-looking polygon characters.  But the music is fantastic, the storyline is moderately interesting, and I think it just depends on what kind of gamer you are as to how much you like it.  Most newer gamers really love it, so if you are hesitant rent before you buy.  (They finally listened to us old-school gamers and did us right with Final Fantasy IX, though!  Marvelous!!)
