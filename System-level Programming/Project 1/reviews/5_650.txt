I have got to be honest even if it means sacking my reputation. I have never played a game so much before in my life. I only own the N64 still for this game, I have thrown out all others. This game brings such a Movie like experience along with great missions, craft, and imperial action that I have never seen anything to its likeness. You have got to get this game under all circumstances if you are a Star Wars fan.
