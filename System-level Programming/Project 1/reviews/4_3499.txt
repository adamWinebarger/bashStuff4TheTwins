Allright, I admit It When it comes to Gameplay This Game [loses] But When It Comes To Creating Wrestlers This Game Is Revolutionary. The Create-A-Wrestler Feature On This Game Is So Detailed That You Don't Just Pick The Face, You Pick The Eyes The Nose and The Mouth. You Also Can Put Lettering On Your Clothing, And Have A Wide Variety Of Masks, Face-Paint, And Apparel. With This Game You Could Create The L.O.D., And Even The Insane Clown Posse! The Create-A-Wrestler Mode Is So Detailed This Game Is Worth Playing Just For That. I Only Wish That Modern Wrestling Games With C.A.W. Mode Would Take a Page From This Game.
