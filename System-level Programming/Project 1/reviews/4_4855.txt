Having played more games of Civ II than I care to remember, I was really looking forward to this game. Initially I had thought it was just more of the same and I should have saved my money and kept playing Civ II. Dozens  of games later I can honestly say this game was well worth the 49$ I had  paid and at the current price of 19.99$ it's a real deal. The game isn't a  departure from Civ II in anyway and may fall short of other's expectations  when they are anticipating Civ III but with any amount of game play they  will be pleased. Is it the same game? Basically yes. Are there THAT many  improvements? No. Is it better than Civ II? Yes. Just the little things  like unit customization, new techs, new races, improved network play, etc.  make it worth it in my book. I've had the game since it was released and  still play on occasion and most likely will still play a year from now. If  you approach this game not expecting it to be a huge breakthrough in the  Civ series, then you won't be disappointed.
