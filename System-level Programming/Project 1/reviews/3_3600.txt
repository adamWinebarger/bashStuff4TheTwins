This game could have been a heck of alot better. The idea of the game is pretty stupid. They should have taken things from different episodes and made that the game. The graphics are good, since it's only playstation. The multiplayer is pretty fun. Too bad this game wasn't released later on and they could have put Jimmy and Timmy in it. I'm glad I bought this game though.
