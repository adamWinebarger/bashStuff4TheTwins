Sonic Heroes is a pretty good game. The levels are super long, and some of the bosses will get you pissed out of your mind.  But after it's all done, the feeling of satisfaction is indescribable.  It's really good to finally be playing as Knuckles and not have to go hunting. The Chaotix are super cool too.  And for the record, HIS NAME IS ROBOTNIK!!!!!!!!!! What's with calling him Eggman?!!

Anyway, BUY THIS GAME!!! You'll be glad you did.
