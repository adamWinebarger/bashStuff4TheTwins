Super Mario 64 is one of the best games ever. It's a classic, no Mario fan should be without it. Now, onto the reveiw:
Controls:9.5/10
It's pretty good compaired to some games, but most games have much smoother control. But since this is one of the first N64 games, I'm going to give it a good rating considering there are no PS2s, GCs, or Xboxs.
There's mario's famous jump, double jump, and triple jump. The double and triple jumps can be performed by timing when you press the A button.
There is also the groundpound aka buttstomp and other confusing jumps. Also, Mario can pick up and throw various items, climb walls using the wall jump,and punch and kick.
The reson why this game's getting a 9.5 is because some jumps can be hard to master, and controlling Mario can sometimes be hard.
Graphics:10/10
Like I said:This is one of the first Nintendo 64 games! So, it's okay that the graphics are a little blocky and not very detailed. The graphics are very well done.
Replay Value:7/10
The point of the game is to retrieve all of the castle's power stars and save princess Peach. There are 120 in all. You only need 70 to beat the game. Sure, it's fun to go back and beat the game a couple more times. But how much time are you going to spend getting all 120?Some stars are very hard to get, and after a couple of times, you might get frusterated and just give up!
Overall:10/10
Super Mario 64 is a brilliant game. Mario can be turned into metal Mario, invisible and fly by wearing special caps that last a certain amount of time. He can shoot from cannons and swing Bowser around by the tail. The courses are cleverly designed, everything is almost perfect. I use the word "almost" because nothing is perfect.
