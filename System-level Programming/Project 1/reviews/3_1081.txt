This game's graphics and animations are very well done, and the story line is above average.  The thing that in my opinion makes it average is how long the levels are (coupled with the ridiculous Death Throes, more on the later).  It reminds me of the days of Jaws and Friday The 13th games for the NES where the levels dragged on and on and on....each level in this game will take you at LEAST three hours to get thru and not only that but youll have to back track thru old levels to get new keys and items etc.  After a while it gets to the point where you get tired of it and quit.  And one more thing this game seems to have been made for a bored teenage kid or adolescent, there are no puzzles or challenges to keep you intrigued, except for the occasional switch to find and that gets boring. The game is basically just kill this dinosaur and watch the blood spew forth, while it goes thru a ridiculous Death Throe.
Considering how long the levels are use the cheats some have mentioned and you should get a lot more enjoyment out of it (at least that way you won't have to be backtracking all the time).  Buy this game used.
