I won't lie this game was really cool back in the day and i play it with utter pleasure,(at that time) it was only my second 64 game i ever borrowed, sure the graphics was stink and at times the game play frustrating the heck out of me, however this isn't one i'll call a classic it's no Zelda, Perfect Dark , Donkey Kong 64 and i can go on and on, if you don't believe me try to play this game now!!!! you will find yourself saying yuk! yuk! yuk! "n" i am being nice, it's worth a try but most likely true gamers will find it bogus, it has not true replay value and all in all it had it's time and that's all it will ever have, in my opinion, for those who loved it i am no psychologist so i can't say whats your problem is but!!! maybe you need to play real good game laterzzzzz folks / gamers.
