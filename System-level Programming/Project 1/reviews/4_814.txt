I have to admit, it's not as enjoyable (at least to me) as Tomb Raider 1 & 2. This game does have much larger and more in depth worlds than the previous installments, but the fact that you can choose the order in which you complete the three worlds in between the first & last (something that, on the surface, is a pretty cool idea) makes me feel like, if I'm having trouble in one area, I'm wasting my time. I'd have to guess the reason is I love to see the level designs for the different regions & if I can go wherever I want, there's no real reward in completing anything.

But, I digress- still building from weapons, skill sets & basic traps/ puzzles from the previous two games with several new elements like quicksand, thieving monkeys, deadly piranha swarms, a freeze-to-death meter for the final Antarctica world alongside the breath meter & more. Brings back Eidos' weird dinosaur fetish they appear to have had in the 90s full force (All three of the original Tomb Raider games have dinosaurs, as well as at least one other Eidos game from the same general time called Deathtrap Dungeon. It doesn't make sense because it's a fantasy game, but neither do the 2 T-Rexes under the Great Wall of China in Tomb Raider 2.) And the PC version, once again, has bonus levels. Search for Tomb Raider 3: The Lost Artifact if interested.
