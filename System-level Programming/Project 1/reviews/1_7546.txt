I bought this game way back when the N64 was in its heyday. I thought it wasn't very good and traded it in. Now I see somebody is trying to sell it for $89.95! If anybody is considering buying Quest 64 at this ridiculous price, I urge them to think twice. There are plenty of far, far better games for your money. I know there weren't that many RPGs for the N64 but that doesn't make this game a classic IMHO. You'd be better off looking for some of the excellent SNES RPGs like FF II and III or Legend of Zelda A Link to the Past.
