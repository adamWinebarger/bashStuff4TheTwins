Mortal Kombat Mythologies sucked just as much as the other MK Adventure games. Those being of course,Special Forces and Shaolin Monks. The storyline in this game is set years and years before the first MK Tournament took place. I guess you could call it a pre-quel. The gameplay is absolutley terrible. The controls are very unresponsive and there are WAY too many cheap hits that you take in this game. MKM mixes both repetive digitized graphic gameplay and awful acting in FMV sequences. As many have said,this game is extremly difficult. Hell,I had a VERY hard time beating it,with cheat codes...and with it being on very easy. All this mostly due to all the cheap hits that you get hit with by different enemies. There is also puzzle solving as well. Most of which will have you pulling out your hair. Overall,This game is crap and you shouldn't waste one dollar on it. Avoid this and the other two MK adventure titles as well.
