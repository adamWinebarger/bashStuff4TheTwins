For the price, this is definitely a game set worth considering. Both games  are quite good, although definitely the second is the one that makes this  buy worthwhile. The first game is definitely a bit ancient in terms of  graphics and gameplay.
But Gabriel Knight 2...wow, what a game. I played  it twice, something I never do with adventure games. But this one was SO  well written and conceived, and it was recognized by many folks as a Game  of the Year. It truly does immerse you in the story, and some of the final  movie sequences are superbly done. Great locations, great plot, definitely  a game you HAVE to play if you haven't already.
