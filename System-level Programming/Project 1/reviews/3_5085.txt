I had VERY high hopes when I ordered this game due to a number of the reviews that I read.  However, after installing and playing the game, I was somewhat let down and I find that I'm not excited about continuing the adventure.  Don't get me wrong this is a fun game but in light of todays advanced graphics, sound and storylines, this game just seems a little outdated.
I found a very frustrating aspect to the game seems to happen when encountering a new creature.  At the initial encounter, I was hardly able to do any damage and I would usually be killed very quickly.  However, after restoring from a previous save point, then attacking the same monster....I would prevail without an extremely difficult fight.  This seemed to happen over and over again.
Anyway, here is my rundown of the pros and cons.
Pros:
-The game is huge and will take a lot of time to solve.
-Character creation and development has depth.
-Large number of magical items.
-Seems to follow the D&D rules closely.
-Adventuring decisions impact future interactions and character moods.
Cons:
-Character level progression is slow!
-The game is extremely hard even on the easiest setting.
-The numerous restores from save points gets old fast!
-Small inventory for each character requiring you to leave numerous items in dungeons or in the wilderness.
-Accumulating gold for weapons, armor and health potions is very difficult in the beginning.
To me, this game is like a bad movie that you continue to watch in the hopes that things will get better.  However, just like the movie, things have not gotten any better and I'm now a little frustrated.  Although I have had some fun playing, I was not able to become imersed in the story and I will probably stop playing.  If you enjoy challenges, you might like this game more than I do.
