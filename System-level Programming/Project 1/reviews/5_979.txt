I have never played anything like this since. Everything from Sly  Racoon, to Ratchet and Clank, owe it to this.

Wicked witch Gruntilda takes Banjo's sister to hey layer, miles away in a realistic 3D cartoon world.

Banjo is a bear with Kazooie a bird in his backpack that can help him jump and fly and basically you learn to do lots of things with it. You solve puzzles via action and collect tolkens across lovely maps. Mumbo Jumbo transforms Banjo into some other creatures along the way. You can fly. It was amazing. A full adventure all the way to end. We played it for months and I have NEVER played anything like it again. The makers of Donkey Kong released it at the best time. It is now up to the future generations to make adventure concepts better than this one. This is one of the best N64 games ever.
