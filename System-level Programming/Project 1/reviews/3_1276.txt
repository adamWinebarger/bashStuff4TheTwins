Better than the second but not as good as the first.  My brother got me this as a birthday present in 2001.  It didn't finally beat 100 percent until 2008 and it took me four days.  After that I beat the second also in four days.  Boy did I take my time or what.  Anyway.  The music was better than the second and the boss fights but why did they have to go by that stupid three hit rule.  Like with the second game N. Gin should've been the final boss.  The ending was stupid and not worth it.  I really still can't stand the fact that Tawna wasn't in it.  She really is cold hearted.  Crash has a picture of her in his home and yet she's nowhere to be seen.  I guess that means even though he risked his life to safe her she wants nothing to do with him.  How this game got ruled by everyone as the best in the series is still something I'm trying to figure out.  But it still is a good game.
