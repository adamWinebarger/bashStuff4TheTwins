This is a fun game.  I purchased it a few weeks ago and have been playing it every day.  I guess I am biased against this for a few reasons.  The first reason is that the camera angle is set.  You cant zoom in on your character, and you cant differ the angles.  I have played Icewind Dale, NWN, and Morrowind.  These are all superb in graphics and camera angles to Diablo 2.  You also cant save on this game without exiting?  This stinks!  When you do save, it puts you back in the village.

Overall, its a fun, fast paced game that keeps you interested.

I just wish they thought a little more about it before they released it.  ROCK ON!
