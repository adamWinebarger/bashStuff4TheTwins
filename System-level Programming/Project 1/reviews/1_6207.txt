Although a lot of people liked this game I hated it. For one thing this game was WAAAAYYYYYY too easy (I beat this game in three days playing only  1 hour a day! The first game had me playing for mounths! )! You're supposed  to find this fairy to give you all your powers back, and yet you start the  game with all your powers! Plus I don't care how good the graphics are,  Rayman does NOT look good in 3D and does not belong in 3D! So get the first  game, I don't recomend this game to ANYONE!  And you know what's worse?  This Nintendo 64 vertion looks WORSE and plays WORSE than the Dreamcast  vertion!  Now that's sad (Even though I never liked N64).
