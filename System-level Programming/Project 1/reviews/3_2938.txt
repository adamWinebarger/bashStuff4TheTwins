Okay, first off, when I played the first version of this game on the Seaga Cd version I practicly fell in love with it! It was one of my favorite games of all time!! When I herd that Working Designs came out with a new version of Lunar, I just had to buy it! But was dissapointed in several areas! For one, you got wayy more spells on the Sega Cd version! The story line was better! And the music was better! And the gameplay hours are about the same. However, the Graphics are better on this one and it has wayyy more cartoons! THATS IT! I love this game, but Working Designs didin't put enouph effort into it! You think they would at least put out a way better version on Playstation but oviously it was just a quick  process to make a few bucks! But it is a good game and I would recomend it! The enemys are more chalanging then most RPGS, and the voice programing is awsome! PLuse the battle systum rocks! But I wish the story line was as good as the old one......
