This game is great. It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game. In this game you can high jump, crawl, slide, ride on a jetboat, and fly with a jetpack! It's a huge adventure starring... the Bandicoot! The main challenge of the game is to get 100 percent by collecting gems and crystals. The level isn't officially complete until you get the crystal. Oh, and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big. Unless you're a really hardcore game, then you won't need it, but... it's recommended. In conclusion, this is a fantastic game, and if you love this, make sure you get Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped!
