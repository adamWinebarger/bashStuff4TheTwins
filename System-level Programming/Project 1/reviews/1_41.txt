Installing the game was a struggle (because of games for windows live bugs).

Some championship races and cars can only be "unlocked" by buying them as an addon to the game. I paid nearly 30 dollars when the game was new. I don't like the idea that I have to keep paying to keep playing.

I noticed no improvement in the physics or graphics compared to Dirt 2.

I tossed it in the garbage and vowed never to buy another codemasters game. I'm really tired of arcade style rally/racing games anyway.

I'll continue to get my fix from Richard Burns Rally, and you should to. :)
