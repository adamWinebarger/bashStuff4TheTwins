NBA Showtime was the newest incarnation of the very popular and ongoing NBA JAM series except now it went a little more high scale because it takes the NBA on NBC jingles, videos and of course the stills and visuals of the NBA on NBC TV programming.
Like all NBA JAMs, totally outrageous basketball from start to finish. You can expect anything and everything in this one from more out of this world dunks to being "On Fire" shooting and of course the newly added alley oops and free throws. Yes that's right, no more shoving your opponents all over the place because now they get 2 foul shots, each worth 3 points a piece (and even Shaq can hit these free throws!)
You can even create your own character and build that character to be the best as you take on the entire NBA in 2 on 2 mayhem. You also get to answer NBA trivia (just like on TV during games). Pretty cool.
I'd get this one because I personally think that this is NBA JAM at it's best. Very fun and also very cool to play with friends. Especially if you and a friend are good enough to pull off the triple alley oop pass for Team Fire. Again, check it out!
