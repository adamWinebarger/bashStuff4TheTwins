Since this was the first pure Rpg I had ever played, there were alot of things I found really neat about Final Fantasy 7. I liked most of the secondary characters and found their plot development well executed.

That being said, this game has one of the worst protagonists ever. Cloud. The reason he doesn't take the top honor of this? Because there are far worse protagonists, one of them being Squall. I guess emo kid Protagonists just don't do it for me.

It also relies very heavily on plot, that came before it (in that it shamelessly rips off 6 and previous Final Fantasies to the point of hilarity) in order to stand on it's own merits. Most Final Fantasy 7 rabid fans, probably couldn't actually play this game, due to the fact it's frankly no longer pretty enough for them. These are the same people that will try, in vain no less to convince you that X is a great Rpg. (and boy is that one TERRIBLE at the end.. don't get me started on the sphere grid, love story... anyway back to 7)

If Final Fantasy 1-6 had never existed and 7 was original I'd have a much higher opinion of this game, but between the rip off nature and Cloud it really kind of drags the game down for me. I never quite got the hype, yes there are a few characters that still stand out as pretty neat, Vincent and Cait Sith, Red XIII, Aeris, Tifa and Cid. But almost everything else is miserable. Even the Iconic of Bad Guy Sepiroth Yeah I've seen better since him. Far better.

I wouldn't recommend this game really, there are much better things you can do with your money, such as Xenogears, Final Fantasy 1,2,4, and 6. Final Fantasy Tactics, IX, or even XII.
