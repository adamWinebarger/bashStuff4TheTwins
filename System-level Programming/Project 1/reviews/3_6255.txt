Final Fantasy VIII - Circa 1998

GOOD:

- Considered a pretty good PS1 RPG by many people

- Famed "Liberi Fatali" song/intro, as well as other pretty cool CG movies between gameplay

BAD:

- Graphics are pretty dated

- Game play may feel a little dated

- Not considered as classic to many as Final Fantasy VI, VII, or X

IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:

- Turn based RPG

- No voice-overs, so there is lots of reading

- Card Battling as a mini game

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:

- Final Fantasy VII

- Final Fantasy IX

- Legend of Dragoon

- Chrono Cross

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

- There is a version for the P.C. as well

- Squall (the main character) makes a cameo in Kingdom Hearts, and calls himself Leon

- Note: all Final Fantasy are not related to one another, think of each Final Fantasy a it's own game not connect in any real/true way to another Final Fantasy, the only exception is Final Fantasy X-2 which is a sequel to Final Fantasy X
