This game is loooong. I really enjoy long games but this a bit much for me. Of course if I could play more than two or three hours a week.... Things I didn't like: not escaping though cutscenes, not automatically reloading the last quicksave and less 'reputation' comments from your NPCs-  Highly recommended and a 'must have' for any RPG fan.
