This features a totally different button configuration that people were used to with Street Fighter 2 games. It also offers some very intense fighting with blood, bone breaking moves and a single fatality for each of the seven kombatants. You play as Liu Kang, Sub Zero, Scorpion, Sonya Blade, Kano, Rayden and Johnny Cage, and fight your way up through a ladder tournament. Eventually fighting in a handicapped match against two people (one after the other), and working your way to the boss Shang Tsung who can take the form of anyone! However infront of Tsung awaits the four armed 8 foot tall bodyguard known as Goro, who is the biggest challenge of the game. Good luck! A huge downfall of the game for the SNES and Sega is that there are no fatalities, instead you need a special code to enable them.
