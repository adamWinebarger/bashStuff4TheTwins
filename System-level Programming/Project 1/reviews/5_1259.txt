I confess- i've never played a single Zelda game before this- cause i wasn't into RPG games, but i'm so glad i never gave this a miss. One day, i  just felt like playing this game and i bought it and it's terrific, no  maybe better than terrific, it's too good to be true.
I spent 4 good  months playing this game and i finally beat it recently but that hasn't  stopped me from planning round 2 and buying the brady guidebook to find all  the secrets.
This game is also filled with charatcer interaction and  drama. I think you can read Amazon's review for the storyline and i'll just  encourage you to buy this game if you haven't.
It's a player's choice  game and coming from Nintendo- i am not surprised it's this good. I'm gonna  get Majora's mask when it comes out this winter and i hope to see this game  on the Dolphin.
If you are hooked and want to relive the magic- go get an  old NES or SNES from your cousins or someone and buy the previous Zelda  games and you'll see why Zelda's a classic.
Like Mario, Zelda has a huge  following and blah blah...i don't need to elaborate on the game's success  anymore.
As far as fun/gameplay/story/graphics/sound/replay is concerned,  it's a safe bet to say that i will give every category at least 9.5 out of  10.
I'll only give it a 10 when they put in FMV and put to rest once and  for all, that Zelda is the definitive standard-RPG and action-RPG and not  Final Fantasy. Sorry guys, i had to say it- it's true.
Now if only  Majora's Mask would arrive sooner...oh i can't wait!
