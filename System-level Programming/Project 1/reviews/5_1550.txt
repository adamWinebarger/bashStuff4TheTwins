I can play this game comfortably on my old XP machine without a special video card. That's worth a lot in my book. Not to mention the joy of spending most of my gaming time BUILDING rather than destroying. However, if you want, you can sick all kinds of crises and destroy the city if you want.... sometimes that's fun. This is a great strategy game.
