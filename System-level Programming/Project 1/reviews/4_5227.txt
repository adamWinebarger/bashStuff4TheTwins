ever since I bought USAF I was like great but I need a Sim for a chopper.  Comanche Gold suited my needs, this sim has good graphics, runs on most PC's and has over 80 missions.  You can contol everything from altitude  hold to extending and retracting the Cargo bay doors.
Let me tell you  about this chopper, it has the latest stealth techonolegy, the Radar sig.  is 600X smaller than the AH-64 Apache.  If you hover at 60ft. no one will  see you.  This isn't bad for $19.  When I bought this I was wondering what  was the catch... Truth is no catch.
