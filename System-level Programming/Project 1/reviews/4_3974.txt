I can  say the game was great and it surprised me that it was still functioning.  I was usually expecting it to not work.  though I'll have to wait and see.  One of the good but unknown games in the 90's.  Can recommend this to people with old systems though I can't offer any guarantees since who is using an old Playstation nowadays?
