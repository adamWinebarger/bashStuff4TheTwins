This game is horrid! The graphics and the framerate are too choppy! The sound's okay (sound effect wise), but MKII was never known for it's music. The control is absolutely horrid; there aren't enough buttons on the Game Boy and special moves are nearly impossible to pull off (much less FATALITIES, as there's only one per character).

But the worst of it all happens to be the gameplay. Seriously, I beat this game in half an hour! And when did blood ever become an ink error?

  Not worth the price. I suggest that you should dust off your Super NES and buy that version. Avoid Mortal Kombat II on the Game Boy at all costs.  The only thing worse than this is the Game Boy port of Mortal Kombat 3.
