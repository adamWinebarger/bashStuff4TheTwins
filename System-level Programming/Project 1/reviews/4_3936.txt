This ismy favorite fighting game on my P.S. and I should say that I still don'get bored with it...The graphics are obviously developed,, you could notice the polygons are smaller and the characters are more realistic...Although there are bizarre characters (such as Gon, the little dinosaur, they add the fun to this game even though I don't use them that much..Namco should create more of this stuff.
