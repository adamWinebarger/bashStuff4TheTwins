After eight years without a new Metal Gear game, this franchise got it's third entry with Metal Gear Solid. The graphics have not aged well at all. Textures are very pixellated, animation is very jerky, and the framerate can get rather slow at times. The audio, however, has lots of great dialogue, combined with a catchy musical score.

The gameplay is based around stealth. You are Solid Snake, a spy working for a secret agency whose objective is to stop a device called Metal Gear, and save a couple of old guys. The story is deeper than that, of course, but in a nutshell, that's it. The controls, while laid out well, can be very unresponsive at times. The game itself is very fun (sneaking around to either get past or silently eliminate enemies), but is very easy to complete, and take away all of the cinematics and dialogue (12 hours of it all!), and you've got just three hours of gameplay.

Metal Gear Solid hasn't aged well at all, but is still very fun and happens to be a nice collector's piece for fans of the series. But should you start here? No, grab a GameCube and Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes (a next-gen remake of this) instead, then grab Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance on the PS2 or the Xbox.
