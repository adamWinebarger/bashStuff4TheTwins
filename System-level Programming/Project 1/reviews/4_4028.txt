Sonic Adventure was the start of Sonic's 'Modern' appearence, its an excellent game, and the storyline will send shivers of joy down your back, it was also the first game to allow you to raise Chao!, its really cool, also try the sequel (sonic Adventure 2) its got an even better storyline and is the first appearence of Shadow the Hedgehog and Rouge the bat
