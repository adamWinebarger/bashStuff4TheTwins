Overall, this game is the creepiest videog ame I have ever played.  The environments, enimies, and gameplay are designed to keep the player interested and a little on the edge.  THe only true problem with this title is that it offers nothing new, and relies very much on the style of playing created by Resident Evil.  Not that this style is bad, but within Silent Hill the gameplay just didn't feel quite as great as it did with Resident Evil, and at times I got a little bored with the wandering around the level that must be done from time to time.  Despite these few complaints this is an excellant title that fans of the "survival horror" genre should enjoy/
