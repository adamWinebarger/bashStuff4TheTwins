DO not get me wrong.  I am one of The BIGGEST Zelda fans in the world. and I bought this one as soon as it came out with the gold cartige and  all.
But this Just isn't a Zelda game....
Its missing the Fancy tunes,  the story just doesn't seem that addictive.
WHen you first get the game  its great and it looks to be one of the best games. but then after you beat  it.... its kinda boring...
Zelda games should never get boring! Zelda NES  I STILL paly that damn game.' Link Not as good as the first but still I  like playing it. Zelda A Link To the pass on SNES is the BEST Zelda game.
I just cannot love this game.. it did horrorble for a Zelda game.
