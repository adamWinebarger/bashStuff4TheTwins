I recommend buying this because it's a compilation, and it's worth it to get all those games.  It's even cooler because it has video interviews with the creator of the games, and I like to see stuff like that.
There's  only one real downside about the games.  If you want to play Ultima VII  (both parts) you can't be running an Expanded Memory Manager and some sound  cards require Expanded Memory Managers to work so on some systems (mine  included) you cannot have sound in the game.  The audio in the rest of the  games work fine.
