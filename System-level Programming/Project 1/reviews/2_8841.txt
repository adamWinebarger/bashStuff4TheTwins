How many times do we have to tell game designers that game saves are an integral part of any game. Game designers, this is a PC game you're designing and not a console game.  Let's start with the bad points as Im  sure all the readers would like to read first. The game committed the most  sinful act of not providing a save game feature accessible anytime and  anywhere in the game. You could only save the game when it loads a new  scene or level. I was in a dungeon for 2 hours (real-time), dying, and I  couldn't save the game because you have to walk out of the dungeon to make  the game reload the level and save your points. This is crazy! This is an  RPG we're playing here. I mean, Final Fantasy III (console game) had built  in save points in the dungeons. Why cant a PC game like this have one? This  is a real turn-off. Next is the interface. I still have to figure out how  to properly move the character. It's so hard to control the camera as you  move the character in the game. The view pans out then suddenly pans in.  The game tried to make its interface unique and it ended up making the game  more complex. Graphics are good. Nice colors, voice acting was ok. You need  a good sized system though to run this game like a PIII 600 and 32mb video  card. Story: well, this game completely ignored the pen and paper version  with too many battles in it. I beat the game in 30 hours. So there really  isn't much there to expect. Will you buy this game? I say, don't buy it until  they patch the game with a save feature. If you're after a RPG, then look  somewhere else.
