WCW STINKS. At least that's what most WWF, ECW, and other wrestling fans believe, and from the looks of this game, they're right. The only fun thing about this game is the 4-man battle royal. Everything else, the character designs, the entrances, the bizarre physics of contact (I punch while you're a mile away; you feel it) just smell worse than... Santa after a rowdy elf party. Stay away from this game... it gets one star for the battle royal, and the other for just booting up when you turn it on. Go buy Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.
