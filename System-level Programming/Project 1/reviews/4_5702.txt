Fear Effect is excellent!  The graphics are fun, the storyline is great, the gameplay is exciting...  It is the best game I have played in a while.
THE DOWNSIDE: The game has very little replay value, and it is not  very long.  It only took a few hours to beat.  The game IS fun, though --  once I beat it, I went right back to play through in Hard Mode.  After  that, though, there was nothing more to the game.
VERDICT:  You should  definitely rent this game if it interests you at all (you will not be  disappointed).  I would not recommend buying it, though.
