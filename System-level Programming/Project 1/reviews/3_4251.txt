The fact that this controller is cheap, USB Plug and Play ready, and so similar to the playstation controller is the reason it's a solid bet.

However here are the problems:

1. The directional pad is innacurate on precision. If you just need to walk around in a game its great, but if you need to hit a specific direction, it will come off usually as a diagonal.

2. The buttons are very loud and get stuck. The Green button doesn't pop out most of the time anymore. It seems like a small problem, but it can get very frustrating.

This is a good buy, but not your best choice. If you need a quick, cheap way to not having to use your keyboard, it's well worth your money.
