In Mario Party, you take control of one of six Nintendo characters (Mario, Luigi, Peach, Yoshi, Wario, or Donkey Kong) and move around a board as if you were playing a board game. After each turn, you play a minigame. At the end of the minigame, the winner(s) get coins. The coins can then be used to buy stars from Toad. Sometimes you run into Bowser, who does something random, but never helps anyone. The winner is the character with the most stars at the end of a set amount of turns. A true original by Nintendo. However, there is a major problem with the controls...
As you may have heard, there are minigames in Mario Party that require rotating the control stick. Doing this can lead to blisters on the palm of your hand. In fact, Nintendo realized this and was almost about to recall every copy of Mario Party. But instead, Nintendo released a statement to the public that they would send a glove to prevent blisters if you send them the cover of Mario Party's instruction manual.
I realize that there are many people out there that do not want to go through the hassle of having to do more than buying the game in order to play the game. Specifically, the people who usually lose the instruction manual to their games the second after they open the box. In this case, how is the person going to be able to get the glove if they could not provide the object that Nintendo was looking for? Nintendo should have found some other way to distribute the gloves. A way that would allow anyone who has the game, and cannot keep track of everything, get there hands on, or in, a glove.
Nintendo should have noticed this defect and corrected it before releasing Mario Party. But don't let that stop you from buying it. It's still a great game; just don't forget to buy a glove!
