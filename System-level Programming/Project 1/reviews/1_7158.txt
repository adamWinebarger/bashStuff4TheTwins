This game should have NEVER been released in its current state. Its load times are unacceptable. Both games feel like chores playing because of how long everything takes due to very poor emulation. Squaresoft wanted to make as much money as they could with the game without having to spend any money to hire someone who could make the game work properly with the PS1. This is an extremely bad port of FF5 and FF6. FF5 freezes very often when you try to save. Also its load times are long. Not to mention this is the original translation of the game, so be prepared to have a certain character talk like a drunken brain damaged pirate the entire game. FF5 just butchers the English language. FF6 is the same as it was on SNES except for extremely long load times. It becomes a chore trying to open the menu to heal your character or whatever. The long load times really take away from the games and just makes the whole thing a bad experience. Stick to the SNES or get these games on gameboy advance. Also FF5 is exactly the same on PSN as it was in anthology. LONG LONG load times as well as being incompatible with your PS3 half the time. Shame on you square soft, shame.
