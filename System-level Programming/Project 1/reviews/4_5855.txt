This game is very good. It combines the good things of the original Mortal Kombat with (few) good things of the later Mortal Kombats such as (MK3 & MK3 Ultimate). It is worth buying if you still play your Playstation1, or if you are a die hard MK fan and you still want to play it on your PS2 IF you have one.
