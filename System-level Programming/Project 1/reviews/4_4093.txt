On a scale of 1-10 the graphics in this game are a 10. As for the AI- its a 1.they can't figure out how to go around any obstacles. There are only 20 missions-I beat the entire game in 2 nights. Its a lot of fun though. There  is a trade-off between fun and frustrating. You will probably play this game  for a long time and i reccomend getting it.
