Asheron's Call is a basic RPG played online. You create your character from three different races of humans (basically English, Arabian or Japanese) and then assign skills and stats to customize your character. And then you're launched into the world of Asheron's Call.
The first thing that strikes you is the scale of the game. It's huge. The second thing is the unavoidable question: What do I do know? Now here's what I did: After entering the game I wandered around for an hour or two trying to make scense of it all. I was then asked by another player if I wanted to swear allegiance to him (which meant that he would be my patron and help me get started with my char.). So I then followed my patron around for a few hours and did what he told me to do. I killed a lot of monsters and was given a lot of equipment. This quickly became boring and I quit playing and traded the game in at my local games store for a copy of "Sacrifice" (which was much more exciting).
The main problem with an online RPG is, in my opinion, the lack of meaning or a goal. At least in the beginning. You just wander around and kill things. There's no quests. There's no nothing. Just wandering around in this huge (note: to get an idea of how huge it really is, read Douglas Adam's description of infinity in "The Hitchiker's Guide To The Galaxy") world. Another things that really bothers me, is the fact that you have to pay a monthly fee ($... in this case) to play a game you initially paid a fair sum of money for (in my case, $...). Why is this? I'm sure there are some expences in keeping the servers going, but not $... a month for each player. On Microsoft's webpages, it said that there were over 200k people playing the game. Multiply that number by $... and you get the staggering amount of $... a month (no way it costs that much to maintain the servers). Capitalism rules, I guess.
