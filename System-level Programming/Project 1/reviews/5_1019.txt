This has been deemed the best-made game of all-time, and even though it's going on 15 years since its release, I can't disagree.

People complain that this game has no replay value, is too easy, and the graphics aren't good.

Well, I've revisited this game several times since it came out in 1998, and I haven't found a lack of replay value; there's so many sub-missions, I don't see how you can't think of this game as novel and new every time you replay it.

This game has a perfect balance of gameplay for first-time gamers and extra sub-missions for experienced ones. Think it's too easy? Obviously you haven't gotten all the heart pieces, found all the Skulltulas, earned all the jars, achieved the Biggoron sword, or caught the Hylian Loach. Any one of those tasks would create a challenge for anyone.

Complaining about the graphics? Sorry, the game isn't on XBOX or Playstation format. In 1998, this game had state-of-the-art graphics. As I am in the process of beating this game for a third time in 2011, I still don't find the graphics something to complain about.

This game excels in both gameplay and storyline. I find it hard to believe that anyone who has played at least half this game would say they "hate" such a masterpiece.
