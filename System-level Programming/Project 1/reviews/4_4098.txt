We waited quite a while for Dungeon Keeper 2 to come out, and bought it immediately when it did. On one hand, it's great for a sequel. People who played DK1 will easily be able to pick up on moving units, building rooms,  lining corridors with traps.
The graphics are better in the sense that  they're more geared towards future development. Instead of pixel-based  graphics, the creatures and rooms are now drawn with polygons. While that  makes some of the monsters look clumsy, it does mean that future graphics  will be much smoother and cleaner.
Going down into your dungeon by  possessing a creature does not cause the creatures to turn into a cloud of  dots - the rooms you roam through are still crisp and easy to see. Roaming  through your own dungeons is one of the true pleasures of this game,  too!
There are only a few extra rooms - you'd have hoped for much more  from a sequel that took this long to make. The casino is neat, if only  because a jackpot-winning minion starts dancing and singing when he wins.  (Disco Inferno!)
Rooms have better graphics, though. The hen-houses in  the hatchery, the on-wall bookshelves and torture racks, everything shows a  subtle touch.
If choosing between DK1 and DK2, I'd definitely recommend  people get this game. The challenges and gameplay in DK2 are better than  DK1, and DK1 has many new extra features like Pet Dungeons.
New players  will appreciate having a well crafted game that is a fun challenge, while  experienced players will appreciate the subtle differences between the old  and new version.
Don't expect a masterpiece of Sequelhood, but do expect  a fun strategy gaming experience that will last quite a while!
