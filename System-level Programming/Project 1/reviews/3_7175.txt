It was with joy and alacrity that I got this double disc set. I loved FF6, and spent countless hours exploring every corner of it. Playing through this version was just to see what was changed, and I was dismayed to see that very little was different. It certainly seemed harder, and while some of the bugs in the programming (particularly the Sketch glitches) were improved and corrected, I did not find anything to further impress me. In fact, the CG scenes at the beginning and end felt tacked on - like they didn't belong. They also failed to make sense to me. The little things - the galleries and stuff - seemed totally unnecessary and useless.
As for FF5, I almost immediately disliked this one. The score is often uninspired (and at times, downright irritating - take the music of Kerwin Town for instance), the plot weak, the characters totally without a personality (except Faris), the dialogue corny, the twists not that shocking. What's more, it doesn't look one bit better than FF4. The random battles are, at times, too many and too challenging. The side quests are without purpose, as are many of the villains, and the plot doesn't seem to hang together well. The opening CG scene has nothing to do with the game, and the ending one is a disappointment, and more than a disappointment. Taken altogether, I was very much disappointed with the set. I feel like I paid for tickets to a great opera and all I got was Tennessee Ernie Ford.
If you've never played either one, you will likely have a good time playing these two. Taken individually, they are good games. I love FF6 - always have - but FF5 ticked me off. If you're not expecting anything spectacular, you won't be disappointed. Guess I *was* expecting it!
