To be frank, this is what got me hooked on Pac-Man.  After I tried the original Mrs. Pac-Man, I wondered about the other version.  I'd heard good things about it, and that it was a very good game, but I wasn't so sure.  Then I tried my cousin's Game Boy version of it and I loved it too.  Pretty soon, I had forgot in favor of my now favorite video game series, Crash Bandicoot.  Then, we went game shopping in Toys R Us, and I saw it.  The 1st thing that popped into my mind was, "That's a Cool Looking Pac-Man."  Since mny dad had said no more Crash games for a bit, I asked him for this.  I loved Pac-Man World's graphics, game play, controls, worlds, and the challenge.  I was hooked.

The storyline is quite simple.  It's Pac-Man's 20th anniversary, and the Pac family is gearing up for it. They're preparing a big party, but suddenly, guess who shows up and kidnaps them?  That's right the Ghosts.  Their new boss, Toc-Man wants to replace the "Pac" in all the titles of Pac-Man's games with "Toc", thereby making himself the star of the series.  So, Pac-Man must rescue his family.

I recommend this game.
