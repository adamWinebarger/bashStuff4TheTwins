OK, first off, I'd like to say that Um Jammer Lammy is a great game. But ONLY for a select few. Some people might be turned off by the 2D graphics and cute characters, and it can be frustrating to time yourself while "playing" the guitar. At first I could only get through the levels on the Easy mode, but after a while everything gets easier.
The main concept is this: You are Lammy, Um Jammer Lammy, a guitar-playing lamb in a rock band called "Milkcan" (which also includes a bass-playing cat, a drumming dog, and a rapping onion). Throughout the whole game you are helping Lammy get out of sticky situations by playing the guitar (ex. putting out a fire, flying a plane). You are rated as awful, bad, good, or cool- and if you make it to "cool" you get to solo. You play the guitar by pressing different buttons on the control in time to the music, and there a guide telling you when to play. The songs are catchy and sometimes very funny, the animations are funny too but most of the time you are watching a scrolling guide on top of the screen, so this game is sometimes more fun for spectators.
Um Jammer Lammy has great music, good gameplay (esp. if you like puzzle games, or music for that matter), imaginative controls and, and the whole game is a cool concept (come on, a guitar playing lamb-- it's never been done before). There are hardly any music games out on PSX (as far as I know, PaRappa the Rapper and Um Jammer Lammy are the only ones, but I could be wrong). Overall, Um Jammer Lammy is a very fun game. If you're interested in a challenging game with catchy songs, a rock band made of up animals, bizarre scenarios, or just something different, then this is for you.
