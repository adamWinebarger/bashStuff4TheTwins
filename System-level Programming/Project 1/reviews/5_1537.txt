Super Mario 64 was one of the first games for the Nintendo 64 and to this day is one of the best.  Mario 64 is the be-all and end-all of 3-d platforming.  Mario has 120 stars to collect in many different worlds.  Mario swims, flies, jumps, runs and crawls.  This game is immense fun, and definitively replayable.  A masterpeice by Shigeru Miyamoto.
