This Final Fantasy is a pretty solid game.  Its strongest point is the battle system.  I honestly think it has the best battle system in the series with the exception of FF12.  It also has an interesting story and a really good system for dividing magic and abilities among your characters.  Unfortunately, the game is plagued with annoying mini-games like no other Final Fantasy ever made.  And the vast majority of them are mandatory.  Sometimes the camera angle is set a certain way that makes selecting the enemy/character you want to select nigh impossible.  In addition to all that, there are a couple of really annoying characters I just couldn't stand.  Overall, I'd recommend renting this game first instead of buying.  In my personal opinion, it's way better than 10 and 13 (because it isn't so linear or AS infested with annoying characters) but not quite as good as my favorite FFs: 6,8, 9, and 12.
