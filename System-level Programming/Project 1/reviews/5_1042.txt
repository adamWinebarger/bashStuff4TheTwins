So much fun, It improves the 1st one so much, love the settings menu, the blood and physics are awesome.
If you get this game I would recommend the superpad 64 the one that looks like a modern controller. just because this game dose use the d-pad, crap get that controller anyway.
love this game.
One of the few games i know that you can shoot some ones neck and watch the blood squirt out, or blow limbs off....
love it
