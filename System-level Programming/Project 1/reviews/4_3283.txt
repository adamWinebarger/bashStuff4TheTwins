Final Fantasy VII - Circa 1997

GOOD:

- Considered a Classic PS1 RPG by many people

- Arguably Best story in a video game

- Epic story with fleshed out character

BAD:

- Graphics are really dated, 3D character models looked old even in 1997

- Game play may feel dated

IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:

- Turn based RPG

- No voice-overs, so there is lots of reading

- Unless your looking for or like that retro look/feel of an RPG, it will feel dated to those raised on Final Fantasy X or Kingdom Hearts

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:

- Final Fantasy VIII

- Final Fantasy IX

- Legend of Dragoon

- Chrono Cross

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

- There is two versions of this game in one version the female playable character is called Aeris and in another it is called Aerith (note this is the same character)

- There is a version for the P.C. as well

- The CG movie Final Fantasy: Advent Children is a direct sequel to this game

- Note: all Final Fantasy are not related to one another, think of each Final Fantasy a it's own game not connect in any real/true way to another Final Fantasy, the only exception is Final Fantasy X-2 which is a sequel to Final Fantasy X
