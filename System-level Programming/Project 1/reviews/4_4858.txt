The game is Civ2 in a new world (so I guess we could also call it Civ2: After our rocket landed). The interface is pretty much the same, if we neglect optical changes. From 30 nations we got 7 factions, which are  specialized (in Civ2 there were no special abilities), so you have to know  from the beginning, to which type you are most suited. Automation is by my  opinion not very helpful, the most helpful thing is building queue, which  enables you to forget many smaller cities until they grow to size 4 or 5  (then you must check every such city or bigger ones regularly, if you want  to make enough progress). Great bonuses can be won from the seas (not  usable in Civ2) and City improvements and Wonders are little more numerous  than in Civ2. The whole scene is almost too dark and morbid (Alpha Centauri  is a sun, therefore a planet could at least have a little light!), it runs  very slowly (units travel as they would take sedatives all time) and the  diplomacy is very limited (as is perhaps in real life, but every faction  leader is tremendously aggressive). Therefore best start for you is even  more essential than in Civ2, if you fall back at the beginning, it will be  very hard for you to gain back what you missed. The terrain is extremely  unpleasant and it can also be of great importance, where you land. I had  best experience with the science faction (Zakharov), because I was able to  overcome my opponents through technology. The game is very uneven from the  beginning (if you don't get a good draw, you are soon in trouble) and it  could run much faster. That took away one star for her. Otherwise - if you  like Civ2 and if you don't mind too much about this lacks, it's no question  - buy it. If you expect another revolution form Sid, lean back, play  another Civ 2 and wait for part 3.
