Rampage 2 is awesome. It's more of the same from the orginal but moooore monsters. I was up all night with this game, plus theres a twist..YOU HAVE TO SAVE THE MONSTERS FROM THE ORIGINAL IN ORDER TO EARN THEM! Thats pretty friken awesome. The 3 new memebers of your team are a krab dude a ryno dude and rat name Kurtus I think. I don't remember there names because I played this game awhile ago.
There is also another monsters thats and extra for the game. I think the monsters name is Miyakis or something like that.
WAY TO GO MIDWAY! This was a great game.
I hope they make another sequal in the future RAMPAGE 3 which takes place in iraq or something like that well that would be mean I guess if they do that...ALL IM SAYING IS THEY SHOULD MAKE ANOTHER SEQUAL! It's bin to long.
The sequal to the original is better if not just as good as the original.
Over all this is an awesome game for any N64 player....Rampage 2 rules!
Later..
