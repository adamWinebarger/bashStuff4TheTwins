Power comes on but A/V does not work. Be careful from where you purchase. I read "Tested and works great!" But it doesn't. I ordered a NEW A/V cable for Dreamcast and HOPEFULLY, it works.
Turns out it didn't work so it IS the A/V Port. Requested a refund, it was approved, sent system back but DID NOT get a refund. I WILL file a claim.
