Whenever a role-playing game has the words "Final Fantasy" in its title, gamers immediately attach the loftiest of expectations to it.  In previous Final Fantasy titles, Square did not disappoint, delivering RPGs that blew away their closest competition.  Sadly, Final Fantasy VIII is a bitter step back for the series, a decent, borderline good RPG, but not worthy of the Final Fantasy name.
In an effort to be "different," Final Fantasy VIII's magic system is cumbersome, forcing many battles where upwards of twenty minutes can be spent "drawing" spells from enemies.  Then later in the game when spell inventories begin to fill, because you cannot discard learned spells, you then spend hours casting old, weaker spells repeatedly to make room for newer, more powerful magics.  Worse yet is the SeeD ranking system, which actually punishes you for taking time to explore, when exploration is the inextricable heart of any RPG.  And because puzzles, paths and graphics are often times not clear, you sometimes get punished just for trying to figure out where to go next.
Visually the game is admirable, but FMV cutscenes often seem to be inserted just for show, not for flow.  The soundtrack is decent but lacks the epic qualities found in previous titles.  And the plot of the game suffers from stoicism, with character development being forced at best, non-existent at worst.  These problems, in tandem with the ill-conceived game engine, make Final Fantasy VIII a choking aberration from an otherwise stellar series.
While adequate on its own merits, placed against the rest of the series Final Fantasy VIII clearly lacks the elements which make other Final Fantasy games so beloved.  Final Fantasy junkies will pick it up no matter what, but newbies to the series should start with Final Fantasy VII.
