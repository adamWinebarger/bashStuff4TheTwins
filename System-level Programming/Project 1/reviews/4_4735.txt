As I said, This is a good game, Acctually it's a great game. One of the best strategy games i have played(Along with Age of Empires 2 and The Sims).  I have always liked another game, age of empires as whell(I reccomend you check that out too), But this is a little bit different.  Unlike in AoE, were you just control humans, in this you control one of three species. The Zerg, The Protoss or the Terran(Human).Each with there own special units and abilitys.  The Graphics are acctually pretty good, Though some looks a little to cartoony(Not cartoony, i mean to much like animated stough).  You have 3 campiangs to play.(Duh, one for each Race/Species).  The one problem with it is its map editer.  I had always liked creating my own maps and scenarios in Aoe and was looking forward to creating maps on this game, but was dissapionted.  You can decide on the terrain and were resurces are and where you start, but thats about it.  It has this stupid dfault thing were evan if you "DO" put units, They just put your town center/Conrl center/Nexus, etc, and four worker units.  There is suppose to be some thing you type in in the propertis box to change this but it never works no matter what I do.  Despite this problem, its a good game.  Buy it
