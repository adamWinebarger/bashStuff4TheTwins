Now let me tell you straight that Rayman is one of the best games I have  ever played!  With wonderous worlds, challenging levels, and memorable  charicters make it a game to be hold!  That where Rayman 2 comes in.  Gone  are all the great stuff I mentioned above, clearly a fatele mistake on Ubi  Soft's part.  We have none of the returning cast (Except for Rayman of  course), choppy 3D graphics (A lot of the graphics look like they were  painted on the game), and very little challenge makes this a tradgity!  I've had this game for little over three days and have unlocked all the  secrets AND beat the game!!!  The first had me playing for months.  And  when I was finished with it I shed a tear of joy and said: "Now THAT  was a game!"  I'm still wondering how this can be called a sequal,  it's terrible!  I'm truly offended by this game!  All those who praise this  game have probibly never played the first game!  I beg of all those who  read this reveiw, please play the first game first to see what Rayman truly  has to offer you!  This game is just a wasted game.  I hope Ubi Soft wises  up with Rayman 3 or I'll just have to shelf the game as "A game that  got killed, when turned to 3D."  Boo, hoo!!!
