Okay so when I decided I wanted to buy a "new" nintendo 64, my brain automatically said "now where can I find super mario". Hours upon hours were spent on this game when I was a tweenager and I had so much fun with it. So I went out as soon as I could and bought it again.

I was kind of worried, because I had gotten some games with my system that I used to this were fun also but they ended up being a little too easy since I'm older now, but when I got this and played it it was exactly the same. Some easy levels, and some that take forever to get through, but in a good way.

I have had it for a month now and haven't gotten bored with it yet. So I recommend this game to people of all ages. I even let my 3 year old brother try it out and he had a blast, even though he had no clue how to really navigate 100%.

BUY IT.
