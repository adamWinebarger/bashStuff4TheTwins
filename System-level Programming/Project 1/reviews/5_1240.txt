Ocarina of Time is the finest game made for the Nintendo 64.  It is possibly the finest video game made to date.  This beautiful 3D world will challenge even the most jaded gamer.  The dungeons and temples are beautifully rendered, and each has a remarkably executed theme.  The storyline for the game is a typical Zelda story of Link vs. Gannon, but the execution and the gameplay keep it head and shoulders above the rest.  You would be doing yourself a disservice to own a Nintendo 64 console without this phenomenal game.
