This game actually scared me a couple times, as I witnessed supernatural phenomena via the various monitoring devices, and I wondered what was going to come find me....This is a great game to play if you've ever wanted to be  a paranormal investigator--you get to play with some of the funnest toys  since the Ghostbusters movie!  The only reason I didn't give it more stars  was because it seemed way too short.  It's still a great buy, however!
