I was looking for a cheap way to take advantage of the system's 480p capability.  I found this after looking on line and it arrived reasonably fast.  The cable preforms fine except that when ever anything kicks on, ie dishwasher, refrigerator, furnace, in our house I get flicker on the television set.  Now it isn't enough to return the product as I bought cheap and received cheap.  I may go back to the cables that came with the system and live with 480i.

Just beware that when buying cheap you have to remember that you get what you pay for.
