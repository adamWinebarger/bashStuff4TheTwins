This is 1 of those rare games that is fun....but at the same time it [isn't good]...I myself, do not have this game but a friend of mine does and he plays it 24/7....i cant realy find anything i like in it accept finding downloads off websites...then playing with the new downloads for about 5 miniuts....then turning the game off....however muti-player is a blast and is probly the coolest part of the game...1 player is ok...you start out as a crusaider type dude in medevil ages....get bitten by a vampire...then all the sudden your in modern times. (which is kinda cool cause u can have midevil weapons and modern weapons) Another cool part in this game is all the different weapons you can get...Swords,Axes,Maces,Baseball bats,Shotguns,Machine guns,Chaninsaws, and just about any other weapon you can think of... Over all this game will keep you busy for about 2 weeks be4 it starts collecting dust next to "Age of Empires" and "The Sims"
