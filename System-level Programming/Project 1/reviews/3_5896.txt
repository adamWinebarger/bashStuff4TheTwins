hard?? this game isn't hard a all that is y its not fun the CPU  is like freaking retarded even if you put it in very hard  mode the only people that present a challenge are goro montauro and  khan other than that the game is like cake  i wwas able to beat the game with subzero by cheaply refreezing people over and over again  and doing it with ease ... i like the one for sega genesis more it was much harded a challenge and better music... unless you got human players to play with u  don't waste your time with this game
