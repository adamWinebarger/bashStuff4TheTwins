this game is excillent, the graphics are top notch, the game is chalinging but not to hard, it is just a great game, why did I only give it 4 stars? because the stupid voice acting, and why do the characters always move thair hands like that, do you know anyone who waves thair hands in slashing motions while they talk. If they would stop the hand movements and tried harder on the voices, the game would be perfict! Don't let the voices discurage you from buying this game, thair is so much to this game, let me talk about replay value, almost every puzzle in the game is random, so you can't just use the same solutions every time through the game. Let me talk about the nemesis, he's a 8ft(I think) tall monster that makes frankenstein look like a whimp, with a tenticle that spews poison at you, and equipped with a cannon. He sounds dangerious, you face him more than wonce in this adventure. After much time playing this game you could tell capcom put much time in this enemy, and he has the only voice in the game that is not annoing, as he only says "stars".
