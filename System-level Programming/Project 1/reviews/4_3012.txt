This game actually stands up to the test of time, as opposed to Myst part one's antiquated technology, and ancient graphics...Unfortunately, I never got to play these games when they came first came out, and being spoiled with all the improvements in the visual department over the years, had to start with Riven instead of Myst. The game is probally the largest and most meticulous effort of all 5 games, simply for being a little larger and a little more designed then many of the future under-developed, but beautiful lands Myst would take us to..Obviously this game is for a certain type of "quiet" gamer, who prefers exploration and figuring out how to work a puzzle out over visceral, button mashing action..If those attributes do intriuge you as a gamer however, there is no better place and example to start with then the legendary Myst series..
