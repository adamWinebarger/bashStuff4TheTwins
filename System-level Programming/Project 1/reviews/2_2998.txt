I really wanted to like Hexen 64. It's like a fantasy version of doom, and the storyline and atmosphere are damn good. You can play as a weak but magically powerful mage, a strong but magically weak fighter, or a balanced cleric. But this game has waaayyy too many problems. I didnt' even experience the jumping bug in the editorial review either. The first couple levels, i was hooked. It reminded me of warcraft II: trying to save your homeland from impending doom by ringing the bell and such was awesome. And the fact that the enemies teleport in only adds to the gameplay, as you never know whether you've cleared an area or not. The items are cool, and the mazelike and puzzle aspects woulld've been where it really shined, had they been done right.

unfortunately, not the case. Firstly, the horrible graphics reminded me of jurassic park on snes, as the entirely identical backgrounds provided with not-so-great maps caused me to get lost over and over again, thus killing the mood. Also, in the 4th level or so and on, you hit a switch, and it could open something up on a random spot in ANOTHER LEVEL. This caused me to give up, as i have no interest in searching a level over and over for some obscure doorway or whatever. Also, when i cheated to find the later levels wikthout said searching, i found the end-game bosses to be clones of the you!!! this is just lame imo, they couldn't even be bothered to make up cool end-game bosses? Also, jumping sucks ass in this game, so save often.
