I had this game a while ago. I loved it almost as much as I loved the SNES version. I liked being able to play a girl, and to get a cat, and I also liked that this was back when you could decently play the game and turn a good in-game profit WITHOUT the optional help of the sprites (all other HM recently, I've noticed you NEED them...I'd rather do the farming myself than pay a stupid lil sprite to do it)...but I was sorely disappointed that the marriage system is completely missing from this game.

And thats not the worst of it...

This is a 'real time' game, and after a while, either it decides you're not playing enough, or the time system just breaks...either way, unless you play it almost nonstop, it will start killing your plants and your livestock will mysteriously hate you.

Its good fun while it lasts...but it doesn't last long enough to even win it.
