Holy fat mama! This game was the most hideous thing I have ever played.  Not only is it easier than the TV show, its twice as dumb!  The first and second questions I was asked the first time I played were the same stinkin'  question.  From the third game on, I never went without a repeat question.  You should stay away from this.  It will probably eventually drive you  insane by the low-fi sound clip of Regis saying "Final Answer?"  anyways.  Try some of the not-as-pathetic games by eXpert software.  Such  as extreme paintball, deer hunter, and other quickly thrown together  titles.  It gets a second star for being functional (barely)
