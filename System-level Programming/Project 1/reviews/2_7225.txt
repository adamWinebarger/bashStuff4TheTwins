I think that the review at the top of this game has it right -- not enough questions.  Also, the $100 through $1000 questions are too hard (compared to the TV show).
Another annoying feature is the inability to skip past stuff that you have seen a million times, that is redundant to you.
I bought this game out of boredom, and I think that I paid about $... for it.  If you like the TV show, then don't pay any more than that.  But, if you see it on the rack real cheap, then hey, pick it up.
