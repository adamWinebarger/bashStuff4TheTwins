So i bought this game, and when i recieved it, it was tucked away in a paper envelope, just the disk and nothing else.....and lo and behold, when i take it out, it has a huge crack in it making it unplayable, so not only did i have to pay for an unplayable copy of it, i had to pay for a brand new copy of it at $25. I might review the game when i actually play it, but don't buy it without a case, make sure when you order it, it comes in some kind of protective casing, not just a disk in a sleeve

Actual Game Review: Duke is still the man, even today
Score: 5 out of 5

Ok, the only DN game i ever played fully was Duke Nukem Zero Hour, so i decided to try antoher one, and TTK seemed like a great choice since it resembled Zero Hour.....and it's just as awesome, the weapons are amazing with my personal favorite being the shotgun and the level design is fun and not to repetitive. Graphics wise it's not that bad, but it's a PS1 game from 1996, but graphics don't make the game, look at Metal Gear or Resident Evil, and Duke Nukem is just as fun as those two. If you're an action game fan, a Duke Nukem fan, or just want pure action, big explosions, bigger guns and Duke with an even bigger ego, check this game out.
