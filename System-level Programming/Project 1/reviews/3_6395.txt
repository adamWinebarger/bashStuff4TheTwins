Well, this was the first in a series of disappointing games from SquareSoft released for Playstation (followed by SaGa Frontier 1 and 2, Chrono Cross, Legend of Mana, Vagrant Story...)  Don't get me wrong, even the poorer SquareSoft titles are a cut above most games, but compared to the innovation and quality of previous stories, Final Fantasy VIII really falls short.  The magic system is irritating at best, and the story isn't nearly as compelling as Final Fantasy 6, 7 or 9.  Worth playing, but not worth playing instead of FF9.
