How can you go wrong with obtaining a 128 Megabyte memory card for the PS2! It's exactly the same size, there is no size fitting issue, it looks and acts like a regular memory card, and has fifteen times more space for saved games then the regular 8 Meg cards!

The only problems I have encountered with this card is that some games it is not compatible with, and the game will say there is no Memory Card in the PS2, or sometimes it doesn't read it at first, so try again and it should. I've never had to try more than 2 or 3 times.

The only games I have found it wouldn't work with was "Stuntman Ignition" (possibly "Stuntman" too, but I have not played it) and I can't recall the other one, but currently I own around 100 PS2 games, and it's been fine with all but 2 or 3 games! But don't complain, just use your existing 8 meg card, or buy one from a pawn shop or somewhere for a dollar or two, and use that for those games, and the rest on this awesome card!

Known games this doesn't work with that I have found.
- Stuntman Ignition.
- Guitar Hero games. (works fine with Rock Band tho)
- Action Replay Max (cheat device can't save data to it)
