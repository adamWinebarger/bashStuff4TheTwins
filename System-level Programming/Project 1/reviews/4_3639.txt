This game is fun, don't get me wrong, but the problem is that this game offers nothing new to the style of game created by Capcom's own Resident Evil series.  Basically its the same story you're trapped on an island where dinosaur research has run amuck and your goal is the escape before getting devoured by the many dinosaurs you'll run accross while playing this game.  ALong the way you'll have to also solve some puzzles to be able to escape the island.  So basically if you enjoyed Resident Evil or any of its clones, Dino Crisis is a game for you.
