We plugged this microphone into the Wii and it just worked. We find USB easier to deal with on the Wii than using the microphone jack.

With all the noise of the games such as Rock Star, I can't really tell how good the audio quality is, but that also means that it is good enough for Wii.

It seems like it is well made, but we have only used it 10 - 20 times, so I don't know how it will hold up over time. The previous two microphones (different manufacturer) didn't last long before we had to start holding the cable in certain positions to make them work.

This microphone does what it is supposed to. Nothing lacking.
