Mario Kart 64 is the true 3D Nintendo 64 sequel to Super Mario Kart. Since the characters wouldn't look so great on karts in 3D on the N64, the sprites are in 2D, which explains how they are fully detailed.

There are 16 courses you can race in, along with 4 courses for your average Battle Mode.

Now that there are 4 players, the 2-4 Player modes can be pretty fun, especially 2-Player since it has all the options from 1-Player Mode.

The item roster is slightly different from Super Mario Kart, but it's fun to use them all.

Overall, Mario Kart 64 is another game that defines 3D gaming on the Nintendo 64.
