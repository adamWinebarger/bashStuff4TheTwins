GoldenEye 007 was simply the greatest game ever made. No if, ands or buts. This game stood out from the rest giving itself the title of the almighty master of the game world. My Uncle Steve was the first person to tell me about the game in 1997 and told me I had to get Goldeneye and told me Its the best game he ever played and he only had a Playstaion at the time. I played this game when it first game out I was 11 years old and I'm now 24 and still love it to the death. GoldenEye set the standards for every FPS that has followed.
