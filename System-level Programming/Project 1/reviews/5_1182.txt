I'll make it short...I hope.

I'm not particular a fantasy lover, I never read Tolkien's Lord of the Ring, I hate the Lord of the ring-movies and was insulted by the numerous Oscars the film(s) received.
I despise the Star Wars movies, especially The Return of the Jedi, which has that peculiar fantasy-feel in it.
Blahdieblahblah.

Now, with games it's a different story, I don't know why, but I'm much more forgiving and willing to accept a world where fairies, gnomes and other creatures excist.
The Ocarina of time is one of few artistic highlights I encountered in my life...it's almost ridiculous when I think about what I've just wrote, what about literature, art and cinema?

This game moved me so much...am I a geek?...there's so much depth in this piece of ...art.
It isn't the story (alone), c'mon let's be honest, it's an average fantasy tale, if made into a movie I'd fall asleep after 10 minutes.
I think it's all the pieces put together: a beautiful crafted world, the progress when playing - from a child into a young man -, the challenges you'll face and overcome, the music that playes a big role in the game, the use of time: day and night, future and past etc. etc.
It grabs you and most important: it's interactive (duh) for it's a game, you're not watching a crap fantasy movie, but playing the hero all by yourself, when he looses, you loose etc.

I played a lot of games in my life, including many new(er) titles as Halo, GTA, Metroid Prime etc etc and I didn't yet played a game that matched the sheer brilliance of The Legend of Zelda - The Ocarina Of Time.
Best game ever (so far).
