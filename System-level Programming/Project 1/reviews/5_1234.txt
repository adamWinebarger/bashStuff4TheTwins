Ok, I figured I'd throw in my opinion as well. Mainly, this review is for people who have not played the game yet and are wondering if they should. Perhaps you aren't too into RPGs or whatever, so it is my job to convince you! First off, it's more of an RPG/adventure combination, since it doesn't use conventional RPG techniques like turns or experience. But that is a good thing, because the way the game is structured allows for near-total freedom as you play it. Yes, like some people have said, you must beat the dungeons in a certain order, but there are about a million other things you can do whenever you want, and that just expands the boundaries of this game even more. It is truly the greatest game I have ever played, that is no exaggeration. The graphics and the sound are wonderful, the puzzles are NOT as easy as some people are saying -- the Water Temple is maddening! -- and the character development and depth of play is unmatched.
Majora's Mask is almost as good, but what makes Ocarina of Time better, in my opinion, is the fact that it is sort of the "ultimate" Zelda game, meaning it starts from the beginning and recreates the entire story of Link and Zelda and Ganon, and it is a completely stand-alone and definitive game. Majora's Mask, on the other hand, takes place right after the events of Ocarina of Time and has a very different structure. The three-day cycle you must live through makes for an extremely enjoyable game, but the only downside is you can't take your time and relish everything like you can in Ocarina of Time.
Either way, though, Ocarina of Time is a beautiful game.
