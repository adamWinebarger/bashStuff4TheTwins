Descent 3 is Interplay's follow-up to the highly acclaimed Descent franchise.  You are once again cast in the role of the Material Defender.  This time, however, your mission is one of retribution as you battle  virally-infected robots across 17 levels (15 normal plus 2 secret). You  must prove that the head of the PTMC intentionally contaminated the  company's robots with an alien virus.  After your rescue in the stunning  opening cutscene you learn that the PTMC went so far to modify the virus as  well.
You will fly a total of three ships in this sequel, including the  old PyroGL.  Weapons run the gamut from the standard concussion missile to  the all-powerful Black Shark.  New energy weapons such as the Microwave  Cannon add a new twist to decimating enemies and standbys such as the  Fusion Cannon and Plasma Cannon make a return. The graphics are  breath-taking and the sound is nothing short of immersive.
Descent 3  requires a 200MHz Pentium processor with a 4MB 3D accelerator card that  supports Direct3D, Glide, or OpenGL.  I recommend a Pentium II or III class  machine to get the most enjoyment out the game.  Certain details can be  turned off to get an acceptible framerate on lower-end machines but it  detracts from the overall experience.
If you're a Descent fan or a newbie  Descent 3 is a nice to get acquainted with the wonderful world of PC  gaming.
