I was upset when I bought this from amazon cuase when I received it ,it didn't work I thought  it was broken  so before I returned  it is wanted to make sure it wasn't the system so I bought a nes cord and when I received  it i plugged it in and it made it work so I was happy  but when I bought it they assured me it worked , but anyways I'm happy now
