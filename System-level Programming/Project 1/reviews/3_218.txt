It's fine for saving games, but this one doesn't have a MAGICGATE logo anywhere in this product or memory card itself.  This memory card does not support Free McBoot, since it's likely not a MAGICGATE product.  The Datel and Sony brands are the better ones out there since they both use MAGICGATE technology and support Free McBoot.
