I am a Dreamcast holdout.  And I am proud of it.  The DC is...was the new Resident Evil Machine and every game in the series except for 1 was on it.  Which brings me to Resident Evil 3
This is the Survival Horror god.  RE3 is perhaps the most scary(insert shocking here) game of the series I have played yet.  Rather than face several boss charactors at obvious areas, Nemisis, the big, bad boss of this game will literally chase you throughout the game.  I still remember fondly the first time I saw his distorted face.  And I remember well his tenacious persuit of me causing my fingers to curl and my stomach to clench.  He is scary.
Added to Nemisis himself is the wonderful, useful dodge ability.  Tired of Zombies walking through your hail of fire to rip open your neck?  Charge them and push them back!  Tired of spiders wraping their legs around you and pumping you full of poison?  Jump aside.  It is so nice to actually roll out of the way of a enemies swinging claws.  And RE3 is the only game so far where you get to do this.
Finally, the gripes.  Although I have not played 1, RE3 is the shortest of the series I have played.  It is also much less epic than 2 or Veronica.  If it is lengh and amazing story you are looking for, go for RE code Veronica.  But is you want to be gripping the armchair seat and shivering from overdose excitement...This is the game for you.
