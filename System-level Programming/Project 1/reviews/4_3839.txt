The Dreamcast was (is) a good system.  t's only fault was arriving when it did--either too late or too early. It has a sleek and quasi-'futuristic' look. The controller is a bit blocky, and not as smooth as the Playstation. The memory cards are huge and 'chunky' and don't do that great of a job, at least not compared to other systems. But the most important element to a game system are the games. I've never been a huge fan of Sega games or their systems. But one thing I noticed about the Dreamcast is that the sports games they have are generally some of the better games in their genre and are quite fun. And Crazy Taxi plays well on the Dreamcast. I wouldn't recommend the Dreamcast as your first or only system (but since it is discontinued, I guess I don't have to worry about that), but if you come across one used for a reasonable deal, it does make a nice system to add to the one you already have in place.
