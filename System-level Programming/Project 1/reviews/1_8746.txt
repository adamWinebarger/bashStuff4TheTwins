The fact that those two wrestlers aren't in this version of WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game is reason enough to avoid it.  Yoko Zuna is a big guy with very powerful moves, and Bam Bam is yet another big guy.  It's odd how they didn't include either of the two BIG guys on the Super NES.  It's not like this game has a lot of options and wrestlers anyway, so to take away two wrestlers and leave you with only six is just ridiculous.  Get the Playstation version.
