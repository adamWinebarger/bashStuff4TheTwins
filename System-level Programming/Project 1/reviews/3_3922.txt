You know those games that the magazines all say is cool and your friends tell you about and it's the talk of the year, and when you buy it it's great, but your playing something else in a week. I think Tekken 3 is one of those games. I'll be honest, the game itself is fun, but repetative. You'll soon find that all of the characters and levels never change, and the Tekken Force mode does very little to improve. It, just like the game, gets old. I guarantee you will play the game all the way through just to unlock all the player videos though. If you can get the game used and VERY cheap, buy it. It's a fine game for a while, but nothing you'll play for years.
