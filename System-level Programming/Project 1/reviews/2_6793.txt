My N64 didn't come with very much. I paid $60, and it came with the wires and Perfect Dark, but I had two major issues. One, it didn't come with a Jumper Pak or Expansion Pak, which meant I had to go and buy one separately, and on the controller that came with it, the left C button didn't work. It may not seem important, but not being able to use an item slot or move the camera in a certain direction isn't very fun.
