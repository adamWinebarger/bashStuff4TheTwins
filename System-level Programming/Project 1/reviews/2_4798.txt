I've played this game between 10-20 times and when it kept going it was really fun. "Chaos" was usually the one I played but "Life" was pretty cool too. The battles were pretty good but the AI wasn't all that great. The different characters and units were pretty cool though.

The graphics are so so. They're not terrible but they're not exactly beautiful either.

Unfortunately it crashes after a few minutes or hours so I haven't got to the end of the game ever. I've tried it on two different computers, one being way more poweful than the other one and it just won't play completely on either one. If it'd quit that, it'd be great.
