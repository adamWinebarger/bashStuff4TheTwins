If you find Street Fighter Alpha 3 overwhelming, then you should try Street Fighter Alpha 2.  18 characters containing some of the most popular characters from the series: Ryu, Ken, Dan, Chun-Li (has her Kikoken fireball, but not her Spinning Bird Kick), Akuma, Sakura, Zangief, Dhalsim, Sagat, and he-plays-just-like-Guile Charlie.  Each character has his/her own ending.
You don't need to worry about what strength to use when using super combos, because each one takes only one "power" bar.  Great soundtrack, if you played Puzzle Fighter, then some of the music should be familiar to you.  Graphics are great, taunts are outstanding, and game control is excellent.  If you have a chance, grab this classic.
