Duke Nukem 64 isn't a bad game. In fact, it could be one of the best on N64. I don't know. I haven't played much shooters on N64. But, I do own this and chaotic DM with 2 freinds and a bot couldn't get better. Quake 64 and Doom 64 can't offer this much fun. THis is essentially a port of the pc game, but with new levels and add-ons to existing levels. I recomend this game.
