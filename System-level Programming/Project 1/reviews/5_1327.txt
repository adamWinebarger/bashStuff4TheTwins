I remember when this game first came out. It was mind blowing as to just how awesome it was! It had basically anyone & everyone you'd ever want in a wrestling game (minus some legends). And if you had 4 controllers & 3 friends.....It was going down for hours! Well, this game is still pretty cool despite it's age. The. Graphics obviously don't look as awesome as they used to. But still, they could look worse....And the gameplay is still easy to pick up & enjoy! Infact, I wish the wrestling games of today could get the controls simple & fluid as on this N64 game. If they could remake this game w/ an expansive create a player/wrestler and simple controls. I'd easily buy that too! I highly recommend this to anyone that is a game collector. Or anyone who hasn't played games of this era, but are getting older games. There is a crap load of characters, cool match modes. And as I stated earlier get controllers & some buddy's.
