The main things to remember about Mortal Kombat III for Genesis are that:
1) It's on Genesis and not SNES, so the controls are terrible. You will have to mash multiple buttons together to get one response, etc. I don't know if a snazzy 6-button controller fixes this issue, but I don't have one of those.
2) This is not Ultimate Mortal Kombat III, which is waaayyyy better.  You will find yourself wishing that it was mainly because of the much larger character roster.

Other than that, it's a pretty decent game that can offer a few minutes of fun here and there, maybe more if you are with friends, but I found that most of my friends can only get down on a game like this for a few minutes because the controls are so horrid.
