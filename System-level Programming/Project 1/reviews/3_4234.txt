A game that could of been one of the best games in the world for me. I love Star Wars, from movies to games. And Stratagy, sci-fi, battle games are my favorite (usually) out of all electronic games(N64, PC, Playstation, etc.). But this was a dissapointment. For one thing, the battle graphics are horrendous!! On the battle screen, one starfighter=a squadron of 12 (unless they are weakened), and shoot one laser to symbolize them battleing. And they fly around like they were on strings!! Now how cheesy is that? The Capital ships in the battle screen are low in detail and have the symbolizing lasers. Also, it is a pain to get the ships to do what you want them to do. All in all, the battle scenes are one of the worst I've ever seen. But I can sat It could be worse.  Now in normal game play it is a little better. The main Galactic display is fairly easy to use an descent graphics. Also the sound and music in this area are OK, too. Though it is more of a pain than a good time to start a new game. It takes several hours just to get of the ground. Few planets have shipyards and construction bases, and the ones who do have them are slow and transporting buildings all over the galaxy can take forever.  One good thing about this game is it has a breif encylopedia of some of the things in the Star Wars Universe  I think Force commander was another attempt of this game on the ground instead of in space, and it was much better but still hard to use. I think the next Star Wars Rebellion type game should be more like a Star Wars version of Pax Imperia: Entiment Domain.  Final Verdict: 2.5/5
