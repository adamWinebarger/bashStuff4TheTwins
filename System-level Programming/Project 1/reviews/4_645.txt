I played unreal when I was 9 and beat it in a week.
The game is just plain awsome.  Unfortenutly that was 7 years ago and I doubt this will work on XP but when Im at his house I always play this amazing game.  The begining is friggin scary when you're in the abandon space ship and all you hear are the lives of the sapce crew screaming and beging for there lives.
Later you soon find out that they are being torn apart by these disturbing creatures or aliens I might say.  More games should be like this.
The only game to be like this would probably be The suffering cause you here the voices of the CO's getting torn apart by weird disturbing creatures.  Maybe not the only game but there a little few games that are like UNreal.
The begining parts were the best for me.  The scream the horror.  I think this is suppose to be a survival horror game. I donno but Get this game but I think they don't make this game any more?  Any ways get this and UNREAL TURNEMENT.  AWSOME GAMES!
