I know there are a lot of mixed reviews. I am a disappointed consumer who will be returning this game.  I love playing one person/multi person shoot 'em up games--like Quake 3 Arena.  I like stealth, strategic planning spy/shooting games--like Metal Gear.  But Rainbow Six should not have been made for the Dreamcast.  It just doesn't suit to go on a console system.  Loading time is horrible, the graphics aren't impressive (for DC), the sound is not so good, and the controls are quite hard to maneuver.  The gameplay, however, is potentially good.  IF you like stealth, slow, strategic game, this would be an okay game to play.  But, here's a warning: when you are playing against many enemies, you will get frustrated with how difficult to aim/control the joystick.
