I never played this game back in the day, so I figured I would go back and check it out. It was an interesting game and pretty fun in its fighting mechanics. The puzzles at times were not difficult on their own; it was just difficult to always see and know what you needed to do. Platforming was very difficult and frustrating at times with the old mechanics and lack of camera control unless you held a bumper.
