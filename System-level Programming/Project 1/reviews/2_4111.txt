A fun shoot 'm up, no less, and regrettably, no more. Fans of the board game, the series, or even the role- playing game will be in for a bit of a dissapointment.  The game  has few options besides "click and shoot".  Still, I spent a fun few hrs playing it (and a lotta dlrs buying it).
I hope we'll get a better, more extensive version soon.
