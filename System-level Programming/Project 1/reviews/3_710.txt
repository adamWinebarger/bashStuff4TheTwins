Goldeneye is a classic for a reason! Unfortunately, one of those reasons is nostalgia. This game is still plenty of fun, but incredibly dated. The poor sign-posting and punishing mechanics mean that a little trial and error is needed to beat this game. As enjoyable as it can be, this game feels as old as it looks. It's worth picking up if you want an old school for game. Don't buy it if you're looking for something more modern, or if your patience is thin.
