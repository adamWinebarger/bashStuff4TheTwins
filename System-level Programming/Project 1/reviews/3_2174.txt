Mario Party started a 10-long installment (thus far) installment of fun and great times. Luckily, it happens to be the worst installment in the franchise. The graphics are sub-par, the gameplay is more simplistic, and the mini-games are less numerous and exciting. Many the of the mini-games are just inane, boring, or frustrating, such: Grab Bag, Slot Car Derby, etc. The music in the game is great though, and is its strongest suit. I'd really only purchase the original Mario Party if you happen to be a huge fan of the series, like I've become. If you're not, it really doesn't justify paying the price these games are currently going for.
