My favorite character is Sephiroth. He also makes an appearance in "kingdom Hearts" as the toughest boss in the game.(but i beat him!)
Final Fantasy VII is a brillant mind-blowing game.
Cloud is the main character of this game. He also makes an appearance in "Kingdom Hearts" as 3 or 4 bosses,he's easy.
The thing is,I couldn't even get past the mechanical scorpion!
The game is just way too hard for me. But I beat it.
The Sephiroth's are also Hard.
If you're in for some action,buy this.
Cloud is just such an amzig character,and so is Sephiroth.
sincerly,
