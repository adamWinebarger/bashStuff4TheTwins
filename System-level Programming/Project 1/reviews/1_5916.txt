Cause thats what your gonning to be doing alot in the entire game. Move this block, move that block. Put this block over there & make sure its fits in place with the correct image matching the wall
And flip & stack them too. Now pull this lever & go to the next room over & do more block puzzles. Fun right? Such a load crap

Everything is very cryptic
Nothing is explained

Lame powers

Poor boss fights

Easy to get lost

You have to shift inbtween worlds to advance
But somehow this also changes the areas shape too?

How does that work?
It doesnt. Hes shifting from life & dead
Not to another Dimension

Your life bar also changes shape & size too for w/e reason

Your walking makes this god aweful sound

Humans you meet don't speak a lick of english & also make a annoying fake gibberish.

Lame ending boss
