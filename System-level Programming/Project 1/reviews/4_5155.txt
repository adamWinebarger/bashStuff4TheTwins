Hey, I remember the old gold-laden boxes for the first AD&D games by  SSI back when the C64 was still a great computer, and I'm here to tell you,  this is a vast improvment! Overall the game is well drawn with decent sound  and standard voice acting.  Many elements of the pencil and paper game a  found here, with some annoying omissions that will be fixed in the next  installment.  These were the low experience cap and inability to distribute  weapon slots towards two-weapon style, to name a couple.  At any rate, the  game is LOADED with sub-quests and days of good solid gameplay.  Black Isle  is on a roll.
