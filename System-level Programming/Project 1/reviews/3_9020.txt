This is potentially the greatest space opera game to come along in years.  It is depressing that this potential is lost.  First, expect to find sound conflicts with the game.  The game will lock up your PC or dump out of the  game during periods that you acess the game's personal communications  device.  (No, no option to avoid going there, so expet to get dumped about  every 20 minutes of game play).  But, this glich is based on your system's  hardware, so, maybe you won't have that problem.  Next, you will find a  game that bases interaction on diplomacy and spying without adequate  instructions on how they play against one another.  Worse yet, expect  diplomacy not to work at all.  The diplomacy function is extremely  frustrating as you seem incapable of generating anything from the other  races except a declaration of war, which they do as soon as they have more  ships than you.  You will also be frustrated in your inablitiy to  manufacture ships while the computer players just build them out the  whazoo.  You will also be frustrated in the need to micromanage all tanks  during any invasions.  You have 30 tanks?  So, what?; unless you give 30  indivdiual orders they blunder around the map and get shot up piece meal.  Forget about giving group orders. With all the negative said, this game has  a great concept, great music, fantastic cut-scenes, fun space battles, and  a flawless intergration of real time/turn based concepts.  This is a buyer  beware item.  If you love MOO you will find this game acceptable, if you  don't know what MOO is, STAY AWAY- FRUSTRATION AHEAD!
