Maybe it is because I have a Mac version but I was really really enjoying this game when my band of characters stopped going up in experience levels.  I contacted the company but was told that that is just the way the game is.  Yes, I do like a challenge but I play computer games to relax too and without an advancement in level I don't see how to win this game.  I was very very disappointed.
