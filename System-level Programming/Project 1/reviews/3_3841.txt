If you have a 3dfx card, if you have a more advanced card like TNT2 or  Geforce, just don't update your drivers and you should be alright.  You  don't get all the graphic benefits but it goes pretty fast in 32 bit mode  at 1024 x 768.  Nice selection of cars and cocpits too.  Music very good.  Engine noise could have been better, too synth, but better than most racing  games.  I haven't driven in a while but I know what it's like to go above  the speed limit on a winding road. and this game is decent at simulating  it(especicially if I play in a pitch dark room)
