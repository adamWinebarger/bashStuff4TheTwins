As a first-person shooter enthusiast, I had high hopes for Dark Forces when I hear about it for the first time.

And as it may be a sin to compare it to Doom, because honestly and truthfully, this game is hardly what Doom is, I must say one thing....take Doom, send it through a meat grinder, out pops Dark Forces.

Everything in this game is ho-hum....half or less than half of what Doom gives the Playstation gamer.

It's not THAT disappointing....it's still very fun to play....but the whole game seems rushed. People forgot to add more than 3 colors to walls and background images, and the pixelization is unsurpassed. Stormtroopers and items laying about look like primitive Lego models. The soundtrack isn't all that bad, but could be better....the voices are really done well though.

The levels in the game are ok....I found myself getting lost on some of them though due to the fact everything looks the same because of the limited color palette....and even some areas I'm guessing are supposed to be covered in "shadows" are in all actuality, just black spaces with no graphics at all.

The weapons are typical Star Wars guns....nothing entirely special, but it is a fun selection.

If you're a Star Wars fan, and can get this game for 5 bucks or less, by all means, add it to your collection.

But if you're a first-person shooter junkie, look elsewhere for a top-quality shooter.

Overall, an average game, 5 out of 10, possibly 5.5.
