I have owned this game for several years and decided to buy another copy for a friend.

Strategy is somewhat the most important role, but knowing what to build and what to destroy.

An annoying thing I realized is that sometimes you just can't defeat the other opponent even if you rush in with 150+ aircrafts if vehicles, kbots, or ships cannot do so. There are times when it will seem to be like a tie and I save the game and deal with it later. I'm talking about playing against the comp. btw...Playing against other players is great when you learn more about the game.

There are some overpowered items in this game so I find that if you attack in smaller mobs than come in in a large group you might be able to slow down their building of weapons. When they have the most advanced weapons/robots you can't really beat them and neither can they beat you as you would probably have the top items as well. That's the only problem I really found in this game against the computer.

This is an amazing game and you'll be playing it for hours since it's so much fun. Some weapons are really cool and you basically just own tons of enemies with them. I find ships useful for defense since some have powerful or fast attacks. Vehicles are what I used for to attack in smaller groups. Bombing aircrafts literally wipes out a group while only sacrificing a few of your own robots.

If your into strategy action games, you must own this or at least play it a couple of times. What's more fun than blasting metal while using your brain to defeat them.
