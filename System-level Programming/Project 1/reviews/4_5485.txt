While the online debate rages as to Q3 versus UT, I would argue that there  is room for both.
That being said, if you only had cash to purchase one  of the two heavyweights, I would probably recommend this first.  Out of the  box it offers a more complete gaming experience over the competition with  more styles of gameplay and better bot support.
The Ups: Lots of  different things to do with this game.  Fun maps.  If I had to pick one  word for UT it would be: FUN.  It has a feel that is very unique, but is  quite enjoyable.  The bots are pretty amazing as well.
The Downs: Not  quite as pretty to look at, even with a super-dee-duper video card, as I  expected.
Overall: A simply amazing game, considering how much they put  into one little box.  Lots of fun on line or off.  One of my top regulars.
