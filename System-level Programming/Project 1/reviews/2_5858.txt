This game was quite... what's a nice word for it... bad. I don't completely remember, but I think this game was given to me for a birthday present or something, so I do feel bad for whoever it was who gave it to me... what a waste of good money. Sure, at times it could be addicting, but it's way too repetitive and too long.
I think I'll sell it the first chance I get. I don't care what kind of games you like, don't get this one at all.
