I love the tomb raider series,except for this one!!!!! It's way to hard and it won't let you save unless you find a save crystle. After that, I switched to the pc vesion which has unlimited saves but there is only one problem...IT'S TO OLD FOR WINDOWS XP!!So buy at own risk but if you want to play it and you have an old computer I recommend the pc version.
