I enjoy the Gabriel Knight series and still play the other two games, even if they're a little outdated.  The storyline is excellent, and you really get to know the characters.  Unfortunately, that's not the case in the third installment of the series.  Some of the characters are as  "wooden" as Queen Amalia from the "Stars Wars: The Phantom  Menace" movie.  You hardly get to know them at all.  Plus, the  storyline is a bit weaker than the other GK series.  I spent a lot of time  scratching my head trying to make sense of what happened a minute ago.  When I finished the game, I was STILL stratching my head, but this time  because of the ending!  In addition to that, the graphics are totally  unlike that which you would see in a game like this.  I also like the  King's Quest series, but since they "polygonified" the eight one,  my interest has been waning.  "Sierra games," as I call any game  where you walk around and have multiple icons that you click on different  things to get responses (text or oral), SHOULD NOT have graphics like this.  I would recommend this game to fans of the series (obviously), but for  everyone else, wait for the price to drop before you make the purchase, and  while you're waiting, play the first two GKs.  I highly recommend those!
