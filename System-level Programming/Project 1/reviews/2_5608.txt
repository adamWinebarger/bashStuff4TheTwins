OK, this game was meant to be out 2 and a half years ago but what ever way you look at it, even if it had came out when it did it would still have struggled to be competitive back then.
What the creators have tried to  do is take a new approach by putting 4 games together in one through the  different ages played by the lead character. All of them are as bad as one  another. It plays like doom did and the AI is possibly the worst ever, in  an age when AI is as good as Theif and SS2. I think Pong had more  intelligent coding then Daikatana. Unlike games where you injure someone  and he runs to find his mate. Shoot a baddy in Daikatana and his mate will  stand lifelifeless next to him watching the world go by.
I was hugehly  dissopointed as I thought this would be a rival to Half Life and would  easily be the best first person shooter of the year (to which Soldier Of  Fortune holds the crown so far for me). This game rivals Doom but I think  you'll find Doom is 10 times better!  Still, it gets a star for the 4 ages  idea and em... a star for the logo and nice box!
I cant wait til Duke  Nukem Forever, if its as bad as this I'll cry!
