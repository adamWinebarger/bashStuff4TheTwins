With all due respect to the PC version, I believe the Playstation One version of Quake II is the ultimate version.  Yes, the Playstation version has loading times, but they're not THAT big of a deal.  They're extremely short and hardly an inconvenience.  Also, the rooms were more colorful and it was easier to see what was in front of you in the Playstation version.

The PC version misses out on those things, but it does make up for that by having better animations from enemies and bosses.  But the controls aren't as good as the Playstation controller either (sorry, I need a controller for a video game console because that's what I've grown up with).  The PC version also has some more rooms to explore, so that's nice as well.

Overall, either version is a good purchase, but I personally like the Playstation version more.
