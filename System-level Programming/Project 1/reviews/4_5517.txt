This game doesn't have a story... But that is actually a good thing! VR Missions is great for those of us who have to wedge game playing between an ever-changing schedule. Most levels take anywhere from 30 seconds to five mintues... and you can exit anytime and save your game. So, if you have to get up and run... you really haven't lost anything if you take ten seconds to exit and save.
It has all the classic moves from MGS, and some fun levels like "Mystery" (arrest the right murder suspect), Puzzle (think enemy-dominos) and round after round of weapon-based combat (so you don't ALWAYS have to sneak around).
I'd say pick this one up, with a ten-dollar price tag, there isn't much of a reason not to!
