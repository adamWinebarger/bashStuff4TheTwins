This game is very fun but isn't very groundbreaking or original but you'll have so much fun when you configure the controls to your liking you won't really care. I however, think the Wii downloadable version has much better graphics and sound quality and the controls are easier on the Wii compatible Game Cube controller than the Nintendo 64 one. There are better racing games available but this is still one of the best old school racing games.
