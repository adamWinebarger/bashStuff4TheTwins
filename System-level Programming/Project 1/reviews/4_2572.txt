I have no idea why I still play Pokemon from time to time.  I was into it before it became popular, and I still enjoy the games (not the cards... ...) more than 2 years after the fad breathed it's last.  Yes, new titles have been coming out, but no one seems to like them very much and they are not changing the game enough to make them worth buying.
  Anyway, about the game.  You start out as a young boy living with your mother, and set out to become the world's greatest Pokemon trainer.  When you try to leave town, Professer Oak will give you a starter Pokemon (the only real difference between this one and Yellow is that in Yellow, you MUST start with Pikachu).  Once you have picked one, you must battle your rival, and then you can leave.  The rest is obvious...
  The main reason I still like this game is that it has amazing, Zelda-esque depth to it.  Many puzzles, and 15 element types of Pokemon.  Certain types are stronger against others, while each type has its weaknesses, too. There are a total of 150 Pokemon to be caught.  However, some only appear in the Red version and some only in Blue.  You must link to the Blue version to catch all 150!  (To make this easier, some people buy a Red AND Blue AND a Game Link Cable so they could complete the game on their own).
  Overall, this game is surprisingly fun and amusing, and has a great depth to it which will please many RPG (role-playing game) lovers.  Great game, so if you like RPGs or adventure games, get this one, if you don't already have it.
