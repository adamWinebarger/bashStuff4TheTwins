Vigialnte 8 would have been a fun game if it weren't for two things: Crazy Taxi and, more importantly, Grand Theft Auto. Basically you have 18 vehicles that run around trying to destroy each other--everything from a motorcycle (with sidecar) to a bus to a moon vehicle to a dump truck (and I found the dump truck to be the best). It really is a fun game, but after playing Crazy Taxi and Grand Theft Auto, it doesn't stack up. The control isn't as great nor is there any story to it. It gets boring rather quickly, but only because I've played similar games that are a lot more fun. I wouldn't go out and buy it, but if you don't have any of the better games, then I'd say keep it. At least until you upgrade you system.
