it was nice to see some of the greatest Nintendo characters come togeather in one game but all else form that this game is just to make your eyes sore!!! again i say these kinda games are for kids plain and simple.

The game repetitive , annoying , trivial and of course my favorite definition meaningless to me, i felt that alot more could have been done to make this game a great classic, but only the characters can stand out!!!! nothing else, not even the game play, my little bro loves this game so i guess it's worth a play if you have an infantile intellects laterzzzz folks / gamers
