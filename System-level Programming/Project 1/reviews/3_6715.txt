In the past few years, Star Trek games have been getting better. With the release of Starfleet Command, the road to better games starts here.
Starfleet Command starts out good with a training mission or two and then goes into actual missions. The addition of Sulu training you is a big plus to this game. However, after playing a few missions, it gets very repetitive in action, despite the changing plots.
The graphics are good, but not great. A 3D card really doesn't improve things.
While this is one of the better Star Trek games, there isn't much variety to it.
