Ocarina Of Time is definitely the best game on the Nintendo 64. Super Mario 64,Perfect Dark and F Zero X are awesome but Ocarina Of Time is the best out of any other game on the system. What else is there to say about a game that changed the way we look at Role Playing games forever?The graphics are awesome(some Game Cube games don't look this good) the music adds excitement and the challenges are excellent. Whereas the difficulty in Super Mario 64 stayed pretty much the same throughout the game Ocarina Of Time gets harder when you get to be a better player. Also you get an extra heart after beating bosses because youll need it. Its very challenging I still haven't beaten it and am not sure if I ever will. Easy games can be a lot of fun but they just aren't as substantial as a game like this. The challenge makes it fun as well as the graphics and controls. Its just a great game and is a must for any Zelda fan or just someone who loves challenging games.
