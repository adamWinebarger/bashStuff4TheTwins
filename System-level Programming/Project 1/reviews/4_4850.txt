This is a good space simulator.  It allows you to control many different aspects of your people, including socio/economic model, resources, transportation, security, etc.  It also allows you to design your own units based on what technologies you have researched.  It is also a good macroscopic military strategy game.  It is turn-based, so if you play only RTS don't play this.  If you don't mind turn-based games, though, and you like space-based strategy games, you should play this.  The graphics are second-rate, but that is just because it is old.
