What can I say, this game was dumb!  It's just a copycat of Mario Kart 64 and Mario Kart 64 has freakin' fun!  Diddy Kong Racing is a joke!  I would have rated it as "0 stars," but unfortunately I don't have that option.  If you want to give someone a hate gift, I recommend this.  But don't blame me if they surprisingly love it.
