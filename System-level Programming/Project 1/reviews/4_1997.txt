Crash Bandicoot is one of my oldest games on my oldest system, the Playstation. Still, I have never grown tired of playing levels, which used to be challenges that now I pass with a breeze. The levels are awe inspiring. Water is flowing without a crack, the jungle is incredibly lush, and the characters have no mistakes from their hair to their sneakers. Story is interesting too-you have to save Crash's girlfriend Tawna from Dr. Neo Cortex. The only disadvantage is the limited controls-jump and spin. This game brought two sequels and two other games that involve racing and mini games. No wonder.
