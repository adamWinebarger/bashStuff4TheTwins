This is one of the greatest games of all time. Much has been said and will continue to be said
about this passage in the Zelda story. What I really want to focus on is how awesome the battle mechanics are in this game, it works so well and rarely any games of modern era can even touch it's sword play mastery. It's so satisfying to fight bosses and sword wielding enemies.
Everything about this game is legendary, the music, the characters , the story, it just leaves you wanting more. This is what fantasy adventure is about, standing the test of time and continuing to teach us all something great.
I can't wait to revisit this on the Nintendo 3ds version. It's a complete remaster from what Ive seen.
