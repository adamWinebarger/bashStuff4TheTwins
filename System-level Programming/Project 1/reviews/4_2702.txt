Although the Game Boy Advance is on the way, the original Game Boy (here in 'Colour' form) is still going strong, and is still the only mainstream  hand-held console.
Compared with the sadly-missed Neo Geo Pocket the  screen is slightly less vibrant, and sorely needs a backlight (although  adding one would decimate the battery life). Technically, although the NGP  was 16-bit, there doesn't seem to be much difference, and in any case it's  the quality of the games that's important. This is the Game Boy's strength  - it has an enormous, ever-growing range of games, some of which is  excellent (the third 'Wario' game, for example, or 'R-Type DX', a faithful  recreation of 'R-Type' on a tiny screen). There are some more esoteric  applications, too, including a camera, a sonar (really), productivity  software, and a sequencer (as used on Alec Empire's 'We Punk  Einheit').
As a possession, it's highly desirable - it's small, stylish  and easy to hold, and apart from the fragile battery cover, it seems very  solid. It's slightly bulkier than the Game Boy Pocket, but not  off-puttingly so, and keenly-priced, too. Only the high price of the  cartridges could put people off, but with several million Game Boys out  there (many of which are presumably restricted to playing 'Tetris' and  nothing else), there is a thriving second-hand market.
