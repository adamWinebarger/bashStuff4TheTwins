When I first played Super Mario 64 as a kid, I was amazed. I never even had the game though. Heck, I never had a Nintendo 64. This game like many other Nintendo 64 titles encouraged me to go out and buy myself a Nintendo 64 16 years after its release. I used to play this game with friends and cousins. Playing it now brings back such great memories. This game is what a game is all about. An unforgettable story, an interesting environment, and overall FUN. This game doesn't get old. In my opinion, it beats out most modern games today. Super Mario 64 formed the basis for all 3-Dimensional video games. If you were considering getting this game, don't consider any longer. GET IT.
