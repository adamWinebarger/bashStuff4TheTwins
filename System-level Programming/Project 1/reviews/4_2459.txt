If you think that the "Star Wars Episode 1: Racer" is an effort to cash in on the _Phantom Menace_ hype, you vastly underestimate the  talent at Lucasarts.  As usual, they top expectations and deliver something  far beyond a merchandising tie-in.  This is a product which pushes the  boundaries of the racing genre. Take this feature-rich game out of the Star  Wars Universe and you still have a thrilling, easily-networkable ride.
The large number of different racers with different qualties is somewhat  _pro forma_ nowadays in the genre, but Lucasarts takes the idea one step  further.  By winning purses, you earn money with which to upgrade your  racer.  Thus there are a number of useful configurations which are only  possible through victory.
The number and quality of camera angles is  equally impressive.  In fact, the cockpit view is downright revolutionary.  From this vantage point, you feel the 400-mph+ speeds, and it's  comparatively harder in this camera to complete tricky courses.
Where the  game flags, I suppose, is in its surprising unfaithfulness to the film.  There's no ability to eliminate opposition by "dirty tricks", and  you can't disable the "i-crashed-but-now-i-have-a-new-racer"  feature.  The pod racers are absolutely indestructible here (though they  can be seriously damaged) and that's a disappointment.  I would've liked a  "harder-edged" version--perhaps one you could toggle on and  off--but it's a small complaint for an otherwise stunning effort.
