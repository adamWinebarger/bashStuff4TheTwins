Or so the prologue goes in the Soul games.  This game came out on the Playstation, before the Soul Calibur series.  You might could say that this is a prequel to the Soul Calibur series.  Anyway, I bought this title after I had already played Soul Calibur II and Soul Calibur III.

By the time I bought this game, I was already accustomed to the great graphics, fluid movement, and responsive controls of the PS2 versions.  That is the reason why I did not enjoy Soul Blade.  I am sure that it must have been top-notch back in the days of the old Playstation, but today, it definitely cannot compare to Soul Calibur III.  The basic idea is the same though.  You have a small cast of characters who are seeking Soul Edge.  Soul Edge is a sword with magical powers.  It consumes the souls of those who use it.  However, in return, they stop aging and they obtain combat powers that exceed that of even the very best warrior.

You might want to buy this game and add it to your collection, if you're a fan of the Soul series of fighting games.  However, I would not recommend buying it if you actually want to play.
