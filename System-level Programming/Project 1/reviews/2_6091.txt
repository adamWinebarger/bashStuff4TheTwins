I tried to play the game but after getting to the second disc got completely bored with the game.  Un-equipping all the GF's and any magic every time there is a change in parties is bit annoying.  Guess they tried to make something different.  I just like a traditional rpg where everyone has their own individual magic and skills like the previous FF games and some other rpgs.  But anyway, there were glitches in the game and I got stuck in areas and had to play over certain places.  And on the second disc could not get off the ship.  Just gave up and will give the game away.  Going back to play a Tales rpg.
