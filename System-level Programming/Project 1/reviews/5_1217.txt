This game rules! It was very well conceived. The storyline is good, and the gameplay is awesome. I rented it before, and found out it is a game to buy and play. Trust me, you will get your money's worth! Good graphics, excellent sound scores, huge worlds, and good characters pull this game together. I am yet to find a game that matches it's surperiority, even Majora's Mask wasn't as good. I've beaten it several times through, and sometimes wish that I didn't know it like the back of my hand.
