   wrong     entertaining   withheld  ability  scare  hell      enjoy   lot    doesnt justify      sequel   opinion

Heres 

  whats    difficulty modes Youre    choices Hard  Easy    screwed  

EASY MODE
   starts  Jill    assault rifle   FAid sprays
 Enemies    easy  shrug 
 Jill      bites   zombie     Fine condition
   infinite ink ribbons
    weapons      unlocked  located   storage crate
   massive amounts  ammo   gun    storage crate  Im talking MASSIVE  example  Handgun rounds  Shotgun shells    AR clips
 Picking  ammo Gun powder  health items  pointless                
       challenge

Needless    quickly changed  Easy  Hard mode     minutes  playing  usually   playing Hard mode      didnt leave     choice    RE veteran  figured   handle    words Easy mode  obviously designed  newbies  people  absolutely SUCK

HARD MODE
  start    ammo  
 Jill takes   damage     attacks
   dodging feature  nearly impossible  
 Nemesis    strong   kill      hits
 Jills inventory    Unlike   Resident Evil
 Zombies respawn   enter  exit   True considering  situation  environment   sense   impossible  kill  zombie   city

Nonetheless  completed    Hard  died    times  annihilated  Nemesis   question   wasnt   Normal  Original mode       challenged  enjoy       Playing  Hard  difficult  irritating Especially      ft monster   tail    

Secondly  story

STORY
 sum     story   Jill desperately trying  escape Raccoon city alive       story actually takes    day   events  Resident Evil   main conflict   story   Umbrella corp  secretly dispatched  mutant tyrant called Nemesis  Raccoon city  seek   destroy   remaining STARS  Namely Jill  Brad Vickers  wont spoil         RE fans   happens anyway

  didnt    story      confusing    Nemesis       mean seriously whats  origin   RE Leon  Claire  looking  Chris    discovered  traveled  Europe   telling   Jill    city        Leon  Claire cross paths    

   doesnt  sense   mind    RE   Jill makes     RPD building     half   doors  boarded upbarricaded   access   contradict REs plot altogether   Leon  Claire    building  doesnt   sense  didnt       doors Jill didnt     locked  story   pretty clustered       story     sidestory        rushed     lot      

Thirdly  Nemesis

NEMESIS
Despite    earlier    Nemesis    addition     definitely adds   suspense        hes   pop   surprise    doesnt     tired  frustrated   Mainly     lot     city     explore  couldnt     pursued  Nemesis       minutes apart   appearance  exploring   hell    sooner    yes   fend    theres     hes nearly impossible  kill    wasting precious ammo  health trying  fight          remember    RE  theres   similarity      huge mutant zombies  stalk  throughout      obvious  Nemesis   variation   

Pros
RE  improve  add    features     dodge feature   adds   gameplay  helps  ton    combat   Capcom    finally add   degree spin  enables     quickly  run  avoid danger   liked   Gun powder mixing feature  enables   create ammunition   weapons    lot  action  surprises    Adding  interactive environmental objects explosive barrels etc   nice feature   helped  difficult situations      outdoor environment         nice breakaway       finally     press  action button       flight  stairs

Cons
 graphics      RE  RE   slight improvement    models  design  prerendered environments  look    dark   RE    nice      short compared        playable   Jill  camera angles   annoying sometimes especially     enemy blocking  view           wasnt  scary exciting  suspenseful  RE  RE    moments    jump    seat  lastly  lacks  story

Conclusion
Bottom line RENemesis      fun scary  entertaining          opinion   weakest    series    disagrees obviously hasnt played       cut   slack  Resident evil    lot  live       Resident Evil   set   standard   series    Resident Evil    legendary    possibly   sequel   video   history     RE      sequel   isnt     predecessor
