What, you thought they were for the game? Get real... The arcade game was more fun... and all you did was walk/fly right and punch!! I can't go lower than one with the ratings, so I decided to use it for something worth while. The actual score I give Superman 64 on a scale of 1 to 5 is -12. See if you can find anyone who disagrees...

Ehh, changed my mind... I'll show the game's score... wouldn't want anyone to think I actually liked this thing...

(You know what, I get tired of people thinking I actually LIKE this thing, so I change the star rating to give it the score it deserves...)
