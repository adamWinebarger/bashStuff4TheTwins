That said, the game is really fun. Not too hard that you rent it and after a while throw the controller down in frusteration-not too easy that you breeze through it. No, there are gems to collect and characters to meet. This was the beginning of Spyro. He only got better and better in future games. Check this one out first though or it'll drive you crazy(everything improves SO much in the next game)Did I mention how CUTE Spyro is??
