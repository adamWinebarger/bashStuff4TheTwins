Given that I have upset many people with my controversial view of this (cough) classic I decided to give it a second chance.
Let's see let's put it through the test.
Graphics: 1 out of 5 (it fits on the Gameboy Color, that's pathetic for a PSX)
Sound: 1 out of 5 (fairly decent sound effects, bad music)
Controls: 1 out of 5 (these are the worst controls ever)
Fun Factor: 1 out of 5 (I still returned it the next day)
So there you have it.  This is a very bad game and I would rather have my tounge frozen to a pole with rabid poodles knawing at my ankles than play this again.  Word of advice, buy a PS2 and get Grand Theft Auto 3, you will not regret that financial investment.
