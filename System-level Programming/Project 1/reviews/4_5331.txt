Quite the little breakthrough when this game came out, although on the surface one would not really know why..Yes the graphics are especially nice for the time, the tone is decidedly dark, and the plot is  unusual, but what players became facinated by was the development of the story and how it related to your gameplay..More game makers should take the cues that psychology plays in this game, as it offers an entirely new, less restrictive playground for the seasoned player to venture off into..
