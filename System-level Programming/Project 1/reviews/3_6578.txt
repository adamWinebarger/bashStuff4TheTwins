There are obvious improvements with Diablo 2 such as improved character developement and better graphics. But there really isn't a whole lot better about this game than its predicessor. Also, the fact that the game has been  delayed and delayed some more has really got me wondering if they are ever  going to get this right. Who knows, maybe the final version might change my  mind, but this latest beta doesn't make me want to go stand in line and buy  it whenever it does come out.
