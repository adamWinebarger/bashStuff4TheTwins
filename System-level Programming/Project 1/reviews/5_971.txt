After Rareware turned GoldenEye into a system-seller for the Nintendo 64, it broke out again with the action-platformer Banjo-Kazooie. An ugly old witch named Gruntilda has taken Banjo's sister Tootie and plans to suck the beauty out of her. Banjo and Kazooie (the bird that lives in his backpack) must brave Gruntilda's fortress to get Tootie back.

The plot is a little sugary and kiddie, but it's really just an excuse to send gamers on a Mario 64-style adventure, where completing tasks and puzzles in worlds will open up new worlds to explore. Yes it's pretty much a clone of Mario, but at the same time it refines and enhances the Mario formula. Players have more unique special moves at their disposal, and these are much more essential to navigating the environment and solving puzzles. Worlds are beautiful, creative, and expansive, tossing you into a room with a giant shark, a huge snowman, or a forest where you can actively move between the seasons. It's all topped by memorable music that changes to fit the environment, fades, or grows louder depending on where you are in the stage.

This is a game that has aged gracefully. Yes it's on an old system, but the art design and music still hold up well like the classic Mario titles, and gameplay is solid. A masterful experience thats supplemented quite well by its sequel, Banjo Tooie.
