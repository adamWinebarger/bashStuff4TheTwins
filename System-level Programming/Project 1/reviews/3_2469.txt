The Phantom Menace.  Sometimes this game seems like an excellent one, while at others it is downright boring and silly.
The graphics, while not the best, are certainly the best i'll ever see on my fast-approaching  obsolete computer.  They are still pretty impressive though, as are the  reflections, particle trails, and other little graphical effects.  The  sounds and voices are all pretty good too.
While the first few levels and  the last few levels are pretty much fun, the Tatooine levels are boring and  silly.  Also, after playing the jedi for half of the game, you feel  immeasurably weak when you are forced to play as panaka or the queen with  her wimpy "droid stunner" gun.
The first time you play this  game, it is pretty fun and challenging.  Most of the puzzles aren't too  difficult, but then you get to those jumping puzzles like the one on level  three, and due to the awkward POV and controls, it takes twenty minutes to  cross that little bit of water.  This becomes a constant problem  later...little jumping puzzles that take a vast amount of time and get very  annoying very fast.  It's also annoying running around tatooine, running  when people try to kill you but not allowed to kill them, and trying to  trade things back and forth.
Fortunately, the darth maul fights are  pretty cool.
The second time you play the game, it's extremely easy, and  I don't think I died once, and I beat the game in one sitting.  Boring,  fast, this game is fun the first time but has no replayability value.  Add  to that the lack of variety in enemies (100's of battle droids with once  and a while a destroyer thrown in), and the lack of multiplayer, and you  get a game which is decent but not worth the original $50 price.
Now that  the price has gone down, if you like these types of games, I'd recommend  trying it, but if you prefer shoot-em-up action games, stear clear of this  one.
