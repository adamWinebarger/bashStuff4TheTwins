This is overall one of the best Zelda games to date. It has lush environments and crisp sound effects and music. And the controls are super!  You have great control over link and the camera. The weapon system is good  as well. The story line leaves something to be desired though. It is a very  basic story: Ganondorf kidnaps Zelda, Link tries to save her by going to  the future. THAT'S IT! There are very few twists in the plot, if any, that  I can remember. Also, The game was way too short. I bought the game around  Thanksgiving and had it beaten by the 2nd or 3rd week of December. But,  putting those negatives aside, this is one hell of a game. (Oh yeah, the  Water Temple is TORTURE! )
