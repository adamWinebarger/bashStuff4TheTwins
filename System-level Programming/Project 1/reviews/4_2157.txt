At first I thought this game [stunk] cause there was no save feature but there is a password feature and you can use other people's passwords to start out on whatever level you feel. Cheating has never looked so good! There are great graphics and action and the gameplay is very straightforward. All in all it deserves an A -. A great gift to receive in September.
