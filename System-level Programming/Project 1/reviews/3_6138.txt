I have both Unreal tournament and Quake 3. Even though I like Q3 I think UT is a better choice. Single player in Q3 totally lacks.. it gets old quickly. The multiplayer is nearly unplayable unless you have something better than 56k or something over a 600mhz processor. Don't get Q3 if you have less than a 500mhz processor..unless you have a VERY good video card. You won't be able to enjoy Q3's best quality..GRAPHICS. Im not putting Q3 down it's a revolutionary game and a good high action deathmatch... I still enjoy playing it online with other people. But check out Unreal Tournament first. UT beats Q3 in most aspects.
