Tenchu: Stealth assassin - Circa

GOOD:

- Easy and fun stealth gameplay

- nice/tight controls

BAD:

- Really dated graphics

- Stealth gameplay can be overly simple

- Little replay value with not much to unlock

WILL IT FIT YOUR TASTE:

- Ancient Japanese samurai and swords theme

- Ninja Stealth gameplay, more fun hack and slash then overly complex (think more Metal Gear then Splinter Cell)

- Two playable characters one male and one female

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:

- Tenchu 2: Birth of the assassin

- Metal Gear Solid

- Siphon Filter

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

- Getting a better ninja rank at the end of missions unlocks much better items
