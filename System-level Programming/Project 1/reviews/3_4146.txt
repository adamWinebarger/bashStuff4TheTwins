I bought this game thinking that it would take up hours of my time, and that it would be fun. I was right in thinking that it was fun, but the game is WAY too short. There's almost no strategy in this game... if you know how to mash the buttons repeatedly for a long time then you'll beat this game in about twenty minutes. Sure there are a plethora of weapons to use, and you can play with a friend cooperatively (or against each other) but it won't entertain you forever. Although you get to chose from three players (and chose from three differennt starting points) all routes in the game are basically the same. If you like fighting games with tons of weapons, then get it. However, if you want to be satisfied with a game for more than twenty minutes, I'm sure you can find something better...
