I would have given this game 5 stars were it not so blatantly hateful of Republicans. The last portion of the game gave the character no option but to spew venom, hate, and lies about Republicans. I only finished the game anyway because I had already bought it and thrown away the receipt. Otherwise, I would have returned it.

In the future, with regards to the rumoured upcoming Fallout 3, I will keep the receipt and do internet research about that game before deciding to keep it for good.

While fatally flawed by its undisguised bias, the game, in its time, was excellent. The mixture of realistic weapon, sex, graphic violence, post apocalyptic storyline, and rpg elements make this an almost great game.

The graphics were quite dated and the sound effects often cut out, but this was not the game's fault. I bought this game long after its time. Unsurprisingly, the intervening years since the game's first release saw graphics and sound standards rise dramatically. My soundcard also was not supported for by the game. Again, not surprising and not at all the game's fault.
