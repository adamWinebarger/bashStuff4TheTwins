Kingpin...where should I start?  The main highpoint of this game is the impressive and funny songs by Cypress Hill that were made exclusively for this game.  Aside from all the profanity and blood and gore, this game is  ok but not one of the best games from Interplay.  This game is basically  your Quake mod that has a story and some additional features added to it.  However it is funny to see the reactions of people in the game when you  pull a gun on them.  If you are up for lines and lines of profanity, tons  of blood and gore and missions that require you bounce heads with some big  boys, then this game is for you!  The only drawback is the long load times  so make sure your computer chair is comfy.
