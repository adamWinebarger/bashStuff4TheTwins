I don't know how people are rating this game so highly.  I am a huge MK fan, but this game defines why I try to forget that MK3 and UMK3 came into existence.  This is an absolutely horribly programmed one player game.  The computer controlled players anticipate and counter every single move you do even on very easy!  You have to pick Motaro just to make it to the end, and then who had the brilliant idea of giving Shao Kahn a throw-there goes the one way you could beat him with most players.  Avalance software must have spent one day configuring the AI for this stinker.  Then, to make matters worse, the Playstation D-pad controls like a tuna boat in a boat race.  Good luck not breaking your controller as you watch your character get decimated and wonder why the move you tapped in did not work, over and over again.  Then after I finally beat the game with Scorpion, the machine crashed twice so who knows if he has an ending or not.
The only reason I gave it two stars, is that with two people you do get an almost arcade perfect MK experience, but you still deal with the absolutely ridiculous characters of MK3 and UMK3 and all its palette swaps.  My advice is to turn off aggressor mode as well as all of those cheap auto combos and pretend you are playing MKII with some extra backgrounds.
