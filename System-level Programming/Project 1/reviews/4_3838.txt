Sega's detractors still ask  "why own a Dreamcast?They also state they're a waste of money because they failed the 128 bit system wars." I respond by saying they are pretty inexpensive if you can find them used. I recently rebought a Sega Dreamcast, 4 controllers, 5 games and it only cost me 50$. I think that's a great deal. The Dreamcast's graphics still impress even today. Not to mention that the Dreamcast's best games are also in my opinion some of the best of all time. The Dreamcast's library consists of adventure games like Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure 2 plus fighting games like Soul Calibur and Virtua Fighter 4. If you get tired of playing games for a while the Dreamcast will also play audio cds and features an internet connection.  So even though the Dreamcast didn't survive the battle of the other 128 bit systems that came after it they set the bar for them and are still worth owning in my opinion.
