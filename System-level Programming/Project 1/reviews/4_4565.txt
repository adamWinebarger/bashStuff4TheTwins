This is the first "Gabriel Knight" game that I've played, and I'm definitely looking forward to playing more games in the series. "GKIII: Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned" had its moments of brilliance.
The characters were well developed, with distinct personalities. The voice acting, however, ranged from decent to shame-on-you bad. Case in point: Tim Curry as Gabe Knight. His accent seemed to shift wildly from Southern to...something unidentified. Hall of shame nominee: Scottish thugs proclaiming: "We're Scots, God help ye!".
The graphics were generally detailed, but pixellated. 3D models had a tendency to cut in and out of the screen.
There were plenty of places to explore in the chateau, museum, church, and town of Rennes-le-Chateau, and in the surrounding countryside. The puzzles were often difficult, and I frequently found myself backtracking for missed items. Also, there is a lot of downtime in some of the timeblocks so I found myself wandering around for a while trying to kill time.
The storyline was genuinely unlike anything I've ever played before. Although the initial premise is that of a vampire cult kidnapping a child, the ending drastically reinvented the story of Jesus, which is sure to offend many. I *still* don't understand half of the cutscenes and ending months after playing it.
There was a lot of dialogue to sort through, and many locations that I had to backtrack through, so this game kept me busy for quite a long time. "GKIII" is not for everyone's tastes, hence the M rating. It deals with vampirism and a reinvention of the death of Jesus. It was definitely thought provoking and entertaining, and if you're a fan of mystery and the supernatural then "Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned" is worth a look.
