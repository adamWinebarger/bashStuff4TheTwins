All right, listen up all you so-called video game "experts" and "critics!" Let me give you the lowdown on Final Fantasy VII.
For the past year, I have stood by Final Fantasy VII saying that it is the best RPG ever created. I was wrong. It WAS the best RPG ever created in 1997. When FF VII first came out on the PSX it was said to be the best game ever put on the PSX. They were right. When it was released in '97 the graphics in the game blew away the graphics of previous games and later games. The storyline itself was gripping and although it had it's dull moments, it culminated in a spectacular finish.
Now I think the reason that most of you think this game sucks is because it has been 7 years, 7 YEARS!! since this game hit the shelves and every year we see new games and flashier graphics. And you DARE compare this game to a PS2 GAME!!!! It's just not fair. The capabilities of the PSX could never, in a million years, rival that of the PS2's capabilities. It's just not gonna happen.
Other than that this game is tolerable considering today's standards. But they will never be able to compete with FF VII's soundtrack, it is beyond competition.
OUT!
