Silent Hill in space and just about as annoying. I understand the tension that the developers were trying to create and they succeed but this is ridiculous.  Constantly low on ammo with weapons so defective the manufacturers would be promptly put out of business all the while being attacked by hordes of wrench wielding, regenerating zombies.  You aint gotta chance and thank heavens for cheats or I wouldn't be bothered.  If you could get it for under 10 bucks go for it and kill some time.  But I sure wouldn't spend the money that is being demanded on Amazon.
