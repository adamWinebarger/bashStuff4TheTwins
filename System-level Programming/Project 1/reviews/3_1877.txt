I think this is an OK game but the levels are empty and the game is a bit too hard for me I like the cutsenses though it is pretty interesting to see some good bosses like Ripper Roo, Papu Papu, Komodo Joe, Pinstripe and Nitrous Oxide. I like the Cortex fight I like crash's moves. I give this a below average of 3 stars out of 5.
