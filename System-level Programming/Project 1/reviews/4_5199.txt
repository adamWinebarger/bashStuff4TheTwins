WarCraft 2 is a legendary game made by Blizzard, a big gaming company as of now.  The game when it came out had everything and was a start of a brand new kind of game play.  Now with THIS edition though you can play on  the internet, which was something many people wanted for some time.  The  races of 2 arn't nearly as strategic as StarCraft, its following great  achiever, due to the facts that the Orcs and Humans in the game play are  almost identical.  The only real difference is the spells, and the way the  units look.
There is 2 reasons that I think you should buy this over  StarCraft... One is that it has two GREAT previews of the upcoming game  WarCraft 3 and the game Diablo 2.  The other reason is that not everyone  can afford computers that are incredibly fast.  So if you can not play  StarCraft very quickly and it goes slow on b.net for you, then WarCraft2 is  something you must buy because it will work much more effectively.
