If you expect Sonic Adventure is just going to be another one of those typical Sonic games - think again. Sonic Adventure is  loads of fun, essential for your Dreamcast collection. (Who can own a Sega system without a Sonic game?) I think that is a huge accomplishment for Sega, because it's really hard to find a game out there with a good story line that is appropriate for anyone. The graphics are great! Unfortunately, you will probably be paying more attention to the realistic scenery than beating the game (Sonic Adventure is rediculously easy). I beat it in 2 days, I'm 13 years old. However, my 9 year old cousin spent a lot more time on it, it took her about 6 weeks or so. It basically depends on your problem solving skills, and things like that. Oh - did I mention the camera problem? (This one hurts) Throughout the game, the camera is a MAJOR obstacle. You are CONSTANLY hidden behind some rock, pillar, or even the scenery! Sometimes this can give you a bit of a headache, the camera is so bad it makes you dizzy.
Overall, I give this game 4 stars - it would have been 5 if there wasn't that stupid camera problem. Also, I recommend this game for all ages, especially ages around 7-15.
