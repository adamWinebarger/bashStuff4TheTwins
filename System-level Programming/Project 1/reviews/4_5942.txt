ok, I have to be honest.  This game totally rocked.  The graphics were surprisingly impressive and the combatives that you use, (Such weaponry as the soul reaver, Kain Reaver, Ariel reaver, Fire Reaver, Etc) is impressive and totally sucks you in.  There are two reasons that I gave this game 4 stars instead of five stars: It can be very hard due to the puzzles and lack of direction, and plus it can be boring after a while because the enemies get pretty redundant after the first couple of levels.  On the other hand, this game is worth buying.  I enjoyed exploring the  dark, scary, gut wrenching and yet unique world of Nosgoth, and I am hoping to get Blood Omen 1.  Either way, this game is fun.  It's impossible not to enjoy this game.
