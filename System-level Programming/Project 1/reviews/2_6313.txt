Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation is the fourth Lara Croft adventure game based entirely in Egypt. A very long and challenging game built on a nice engine with great graphics, Neat animations and neat sound effects. Good storyline and great gameplay with infinite saves. Awesome lighting effects and a creepy atmosphere. Great puzzles but a lot of annoying false paths. Very challenging gameplay but can be too challenging at times because no difficuly option. Good level design with a helpfull training level, But the hub level layout is very confusing and easy to get lost. A Lot of fun doing all the jumping but the controls are as usual very badly done, Auto aim is not perfect and the manual aiming is impossible. Enemy AI is super dumb. Tomb Raider Last Revelation well deserves 4 stars but i will give it only 2 because it does not have good key controls and a difficulty option.
