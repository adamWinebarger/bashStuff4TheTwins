This game is basically just you controlling Flik and steering away from "bad" bugs and collecting points and power ups to win. I bought the game because I enjoy Toy Story on the Game Boy and figured PS1 action is just as fun. Well, I was mostly right. Here's the pros and cons:
Pros:
* Good graphics
*Good Character Model Animation
*Lots of Power Ups
* Training Level
Cons:
* Too many difficult enemies
* Levels don't get harder quickly
Anyway, good game!
