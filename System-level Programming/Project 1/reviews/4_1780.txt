...I found another ninja game called "Tenchu: Stealth Assassin". I read the back of it and it looked pretty good. When I tried it back at home, I was blown away! This game was really sweet. And after I tried the demo of "Ninja: Shadow of Darkness" that was in my game "Fighting Force", I realized I was lucky that I didn't waste my money on it.
I would never trade this game in for that other stupid one. This game is incredible. Going up to guys from behind and killing them with classic stealth kills like the throat slit and the stab from up front. Not only that, but the enemies that you fight in the game are awesome: samurai, ninjas, bears, wolves, dogs, and all kinds of demons. This game is totally awesome, if a bit slow though. It the jumping and fighting action were more like it was in "Devil May Cry", it would have been just like playing in a Japanese anime. Oh well, it was still a good game. If you're a true ninja fan, you must have this game... you won't regret it.
