Tomb Raider. I've played TR2,TR3 and i was looking foward to TR4:TLR. Know something? This ain't a bad game but it isn't a great game either.
Nice  FMV, lots of jumping and shooting. Maybe it's really fun but i still think  that i could do without the long long levels that sometimes stretches too  damn long that it seems that i would give up first.
Lots of backtracking.  Graphics and sound- pretty good but not spectacular or amazing. The story  is kind of good at the start but becomes ridiculous as the plot  thickens.
The last boss, an egyptian pyscho-freak is pretty dumb too, the  TR3 last boss was better, much more exciting.
Lara dies in the end or  maybe not- they have milk this money-cow. Anyway, i'd suggest you rent this  game first. And while i feel that the negative reviews of this game are a  little uncalled for-i have to say that it does get boring and it does fall  short of greatness.
But sadly, it's the only PS franchise i truly admire.
