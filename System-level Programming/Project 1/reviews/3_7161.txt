When playing this game I received a LOT of lag between just opening the menu and entering combat.  Where-as with the traditional SNES, or with a computer, the loading times for these are INSTANT.  The loading lag i received was at least 2-3 seconds almost per opening the menu and going into combat.  Overall I would not recommend getting this to try and quench your oldskool RPG munchies.  Try an emulator instead.
