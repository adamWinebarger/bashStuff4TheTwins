M&M 6 was a blast to play back in the day, but the evolution of the PC RPG has made it almost unplayable today. M&M6 focuses mostly on doing battles in a first-person party-based setup. It uses classical fantasy elements (and a few sci-fi ones) to make a fun game.

You get to put points in skills and learn spells for your characters. You'll use those skills and spells to buy gear, kill baddies and venture through dungeons for more gear or to save a lost person.

It's alright, but there's tons better these days.

If you want to get the game and have a blast from the past, go ahead and buy it.
