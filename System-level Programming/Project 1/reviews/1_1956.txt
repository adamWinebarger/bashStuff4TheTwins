Ok, here are the reasons this game is BAD!.
  1. The graphics aren't very good and plus most of the levels look alike.
  2. It's frustrating, and there are millions of ways to die in one level.
  3. You'll wish you never had this game.
  4. Most of it doesn't make any sense and it's un-imaginative.
  There.  Are those good enough reasons NOT to get this game? Don't get it.
