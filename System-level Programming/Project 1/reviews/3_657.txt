Well, going into it, I heard that this was SO much better than Quake III arena.  I had played that game, and I liked it.  So, I gave Unreal a go.  After playing for a while, I played Quake III again.  Within a few minutes,  I quit Quake, uninstalled Unreal, and went back to playing Quake.  The  difference in the graphics was incredable.  All the sharp edges are fine,  but I perfer the revolutionaly rounded surfaces.  Quake III blew Unreal out  of the water graphically.  What about the game play?  Well, I was kidna  dissapointed.  Quake III is very intense, the kind of game you get caught  up in.  I found myself playing Unreal, just to see what it was like.  It  had no draw whatsoever.  I thought the weapons were fairly difficult to  use, and were kinda cheesy.  For me, it is all Quake III.
