If you like orange bandicoots and video games, then get Crash Bandicoot, the stuff of dreams and legends. "I am N.Gin you FOOL! Face my destructive robots!" That is my fave quote. If you hop on the 'shrooms right before the end o' the 2nd snow bear level and go to the central one, you shall find none other but a secret tele-port. You will go to an unknown warp room that makes no sense. Congrats.
