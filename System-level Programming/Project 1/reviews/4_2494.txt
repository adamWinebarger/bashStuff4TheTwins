For me, this game is just about as fun as Sonic Adventure 2. It will keep you going for a pretty long time if you wanna beat the game with all 4 storylines. And, who doesn't? The controls, for the most part, are pretty good. Although, there a times where you can accidentally be swinging a weapon and you'll swing yourself right off a cliff and die. That will happen more than once to you.

My biggest problem with the game is the camera sometimes. Especially when flying, the camera will be in a position where you can't see the ground below you so you'll have to guess as where to land. And you WILL guess wrong at least once. And you will die.

I'm not sure, but I think the PS2 version is missing some textures. Particularly when flying, the shadow below the characters is missing. The shadow is critical for knowing where you will land. Without it, it just makes things all the more difficult. I think the shadow is present in the Gamecube version.

But I love the level designs and the missions. I don't find them overly difficult. They're a challenge but that's a good thing.

If you're a Sonic fan, this is a must have.
