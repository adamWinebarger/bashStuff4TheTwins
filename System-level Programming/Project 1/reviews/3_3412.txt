As Need For Speed games go, I must say....this is the poorest installment.

I'm a racing game fanatic, and have always been a fan of the Need For Speed series, but this one is mightily flawed.

The graphics are average at best, but the videos and information on each of the cars was superb. The graphics and frame rate take a major hit when you go really fast, and actually, the cars at times don't even feel like they're on the ground when driving.

The cars control just okay....but on the more difficult tracks, it is really hard to keep up with the leaders of the pack because it isn't really that easy to take hard turns and hairpins all perfectly like the computer always does.

Being able to drive a Ford GT90 and my dream car, the Jaguar XJ220, is what made me buy this game, but then being able to use them in the game made me really wonder if they should even be dream cars.

Look to Gran Turismo 2 if you want a better selection of excotic cars that are actually controllable.

The sounds of the game are just so-so....all the cars seemingly sound alike when accelerating....and you'll get used to the grating metal sound of nailing walls at high speeds....

The best aspect of this game is the music, quite possibly the best of the NFS series, but when you buy a racing game for the music....that's pretty pathetic.

If you're a fan of the NFS series and HAVE to have every NFS out there, sure, pick this one up for a very cheap price. It's not worth more than 4 or 5 bucks nowadays, so don't pay any more than that.

Die-hard racing fans? Look elsewhere.

Overall, 5 out of 10.
