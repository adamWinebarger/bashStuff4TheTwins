You'll have to create a COMMAND.TXT folder & place "multitest cowquest theoquest bardtest barbariantest" to unlock some of this stuff. The Monk can either bee seen as some kind of Joke OR the most challanging character to play. The Bard & Barbarian are improved versions of the Rogue & Warrior in that they can wield two 2-handed weapons at a time. The cowquest is funny. Not having played Diablo without the expansion, I can't say what else is new, but I DO like that this game has the SAVE ANYWHERE feature than many games after it neglected. There are an aweful lot of different dungeon maps, so I suppose some were added, as well as armor, weapons, monsters, extra difficulty. On the negative side, it didn't add better voice acting.....
