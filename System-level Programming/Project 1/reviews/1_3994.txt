To be quite honest, I found this to be the most tedious role-playing game I've ever played. The narrative sequences are ridiculously long, the graphics are mediocre, and the mechanics of controlling other characters in combat is poorly designed. I read a lot of good reviews of this game before I bought it, and I was terribly disappointed.
