Absolutely great game and it came in near perfect condition. Now some of you may be wondering why I took one star off and that is simply due to the product coming in a day late on one day shipping. As far as the game goes I'd highly recommend this game to survival horror fans and Resident Evil fans alike. Code Veronica and Code Veronica X are great changeling games within the series, and despite it lacking features that were present in Resident Evil 3 it still manages to be just as good if not better than 3, which is one of my personal favorites in the series.
