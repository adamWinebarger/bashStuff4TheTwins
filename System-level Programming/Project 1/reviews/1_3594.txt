Being a South Park fan, I was looking forward to this title.  However, it is SO repetitive and annoying...the turkey level alone goes on FOREVER.  Friends of mine have had the same reaction.  It's a first-person shooter (or should we say first-person snowballer) that just has you running around the town of South Park throwing snowballs at turkeys.  Yeah, I know, according to the packaging, that the game evolves into some sort of space/zombie creature thing, and you're supposed to save the town, but I never got that far due to the overlong turkey-shooting level...when I saw the average 4-star rating, I knew I had to respond.  Perhaps younger people will like this due to the character tie-in, but this 34-year-old was bored and disappointed in this title.
