I own a playstation but i hardly think it's that great a console. Blame it on the N64 for their exceptional games- but i do believe that the Playstation may have some hope left in it.
Well Tomb Raider 3 is a good  example. This is a huge game with a lot of 3D explosions and gunfire and  lots of jumping. Also if you have something against people and animals,  then you won't be dissappointed either.
You also get to blow uo raptors  and a T-rex by the way. Despite being a solid title, i beta the game long  ago and have since went on to other 'pursuits' like Zelda. I'm not gonna  compare the two, mind you, but let's say that while TL3 is a really good  game and somewhat long- it's not gonna make a classic or give Mario or  Sonic a run for their money.
Simply put, all the TR games are long and  filled with adventure. Lara's cute and i like this game but it's just not  gonna be what i'm looking for long-term.
It's also tedious to have to  play through it again. I think it's a mood-game; you're likely to bore  through the WHOLE thing when you're in the mood, and that sounds  extreme.
But as you can tell 4 stars is saying alot cause this game  definetely restores my faith in the playstation and it's over-rated games.
If Lara were to make the jump to the Dolphin- i wouldn't be surprised;  Tomb Raider always had the potential to be a great game; it's just that  sometimes- you need a lot of patience and perhaps, this will fit  nicely.
Finally, the graphics and the sound are passable. Levels are  detailed but heavily pixelated and sound sounds cranky or too soft at  times.
But given any new Lara Croft game, i'll be excited and i'm looking  foward to the new game after the last one last Christmas.
