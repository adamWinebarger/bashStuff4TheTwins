I don't want to diss anyone who likes this game, but I can't really see much good in this game.  The graphics are not really anything speical.  It seems almost impossible to see the enemy and you find your self being shot and you can't see the enemy until you've had a major loss of life.  The control is rather overly complicated and isn't exactly user freindly.  The sound is okay, but it seems to make you a little tence.  The game is near impossible even on easy difficultys.  I have owned the game for quite a long time and still haven't beaten the first level by myself.  The missons seem a bit vague and you think "okay... what the heck do I do now?" too often.  When I play this, I can't help but get frustrated and it always feels like the game's fault.....  Even if you are in to army stuff, you might want to rent this first.  If this is your kind of thing, I recomend Medal of Honor: Underground or Syphon Filter.
