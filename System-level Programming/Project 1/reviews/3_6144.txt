first off i am still glad i bought this gameboy! i love it. However i wish it didn't come with so many scrathces and also it had left over sticker residue on the battery cover. It could have arrived in a better shape. also the volume knob might have a short because when i plug in my headphones into the system and i mess with the volume it fades from left to right ear with an annoying sound. Its a minor detail though. also the speaker is not very loud at all, like its super quite. not sure if its because of my batteries and i just need to replace them. I still love it thought! great color! feels great in your hands. off to go save Zelda!
