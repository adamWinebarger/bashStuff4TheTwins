Hello again, friends. What bad can be said about Mario 64? The polygons are smooth as silk, very, very, VERY rare slowdown, and the Mario we know and love.
Can anyone guess what plumber's job is in this game? It's to traverse 15 levels in search of Princess Peach. On the way, you have to stomp on Bowser's head. Thrice. All your favorite enemies are back, with the exception of Koopa Troopas. The goombas, shy guy, the Lakita Brothers, the moles, Bob-ombs, everyone's back!
At a graphics standpoint, Super Mario 64 is absolutely outstanding in every way, shape, and form. Kudos to Nintendo. 5 out of 5 for graphics.
A great soundtrack and a great Mario voice make for a great overall sound. 5 out of 5 for sound.
The huge worlds will keep you coming back for more. There is no way to put this thing down. 5 out of 5 for replay.
The final score? Go look at the stars.
See ya later. Go buy this game. Merry Christmas. Luv ya.
