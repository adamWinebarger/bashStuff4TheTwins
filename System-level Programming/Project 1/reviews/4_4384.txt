Roller Coaster Tycoon is a game that is focusing on building an entertainment park. You can build your own themed park, rollercoaster, go-kart track, and many more. This game is released years ago and now the price has been dropped. Being low-priced doesn't always mean bad games. I played this game for months a few years ago. It has free mode where you can build your own dream entertainment park. Or you can play in mission mode in which you have to meet the requirements for each level.

The sounds in this game is pretty good, making you feel as if you are in the middle of an entertainment park. You can hear the screaming of people on the roller coaster, the tune of the Merry-go-Round, the noise of the crowd, and so on.

If you have good PCs with great graphic card, you may want to try Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 with 3D graphics with better gameplay, graphics, and sounds.

Overall, this is still a great game and really worthy. With only a few bucks, you can have another entertainment source in your PC for your weekend. :-)
