After playing the full version of QIII and the Demo of Unreal Tournament, I would have to say that there are many areas of GT's Blockbuster Multiplayer game that beat the heck outta Quake III.
  Graphics:  Quake III requires a powerhouse computer to milk out the graphics pictured  on the outside of your box.  Unless you have a PIII or 450 or higher PII  with a good Riva TNT 2 Ultra board or better, don't expect much.  UT was so  much better graphically on my 350 PII than Quake III, not to mention that  the level layout in UT is awesome.
  The Game:  Single player in QIII  is both nonexistant and totally horrid. This, for activision's standards,  could have been so much better, and as for multiplayer, Quake III has but  one option...deathmatch.  UT has much better options and a large variety of  game types other than deathmatch (i.e. capture the flag, domination, team  deathmatch).
  My Opinion:  I gave this a 3 stars because although  Quake does have some nice touches like character skins, awesome weapons,  nice sound effects and textures, and other things here and there...There  are just too many things that are wrong about this game, when compared to  UT, to rate it any higher.  The single player, the multiplayer, the  interface, the levels, and many other areas of UT, even just from what I  saw in the Demo of UT, are much better laid out.
  The Good:  Lives up  to the Quake rep.
  The Bad:  Very little Replay, Hardware Reqs too  high
  Recommendation:  If your computer is NextGen and you love the  Quake series for the Multiplayer, then you'll enjoy this game.  If you're  looking for a good quality game with high replay value and awesome  gameplay, For the love of god stay away from QIII and get Unreal  Tournament.  Save yourself the Agony!  GET UNREAL TOURNAMENT...Enjoy!
