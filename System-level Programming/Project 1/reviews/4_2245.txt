If you want a [well priced], yet fulfilling few hours of destructive fun, this is your game. I found the ambience slightly disturbing, that's good. Fans of the films will appreciate all the locales being included. The graphics are extremely dated, but for fans of old school games who don't need extreme eye candy, this is a solid buy.
