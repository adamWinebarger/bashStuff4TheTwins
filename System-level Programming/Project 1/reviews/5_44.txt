I have been playing car racing games since their early beginning on PC. I currently have a logitech G25 force feedback wheel to play with.
I have played most of the Colin Mc Rae, Need for speed, Grid and Dirt2 games before. I also tried my hands at more simulation oriented games like GTR, GTR2, GP Legends...
Dirt2 came in as a nice and pleasant surprise. Dirt3 tops it off.

As I am sure many will detail everything about this game, I will limit myself to the most important points for me.

Pros:
- Amazing graphics
- Amazing physics
- Challenging but entertaining races

Cons:
- Gymkhana
- Interface

What went through the conceptors mind about gymkhana? Racing is not easy for most but gymkhana is really a pain in the neck.
I saw the videos of Ken Block on Youtube and indeed he is really impressive. Am I even dreaming of doing the same? No!
Racing require good racing skills to start but Gymkhana requires a perfect control of the vehicles and most of us will never achieve such level. So I find the attemps slightly pointless and extremely frustrating.

Now, what about the interface? Simply put, it does not remotely compare with Dirt2's interface. It is messy, I had to search online to figure out where to find my best times. There are not enough info about the cars, the races, the sponsors... It leaves a lot to desire. A complete miss.

Conclusion:
As far as rallye racing. This game is the best out there today.
If you are one who needs crazy challenges, try the gymkhana and good luck!
In spite of my criticism, I definitely do not regreat this purchase.
