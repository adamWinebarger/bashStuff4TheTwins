Ok.  This game came out in the mid 90's, but even for then, it's an average game.  Nothing stands out to make it a "must have" for the Star Wars fan and gamer.
Graphically, it's a step down from the old Doom days.  Characters are made of HUGE sprites--The closer you get, the more blocky they are.  Backgrounds/levels are huge, but poorly done.  Most levels are just plain boring and the colors are extremely dull looking.
The sound, out of everything, is fairly good.  Effects and voices are above that average level.  The music, though, is a disappointment.  This is a 32-bit game with an 8-bit soundtrack.  One thing in every Star Wars movie that's done well with pride is the music score.  All Star Wars games should be no different than the movies with the same score.  This game is one of those games where the music is just plain bad.
Fun value is on the average level, as well.  Where most everything is dull, the enjoyment of blasting Stormtroopers, Probe Droids, etc. is fun for every Star Wars fan.
If you enjoy first person shooters and the Star Wars movie series, then give it a try.  It's cheap money-wise, however, it's just that, as well (gameplay-wise)--cheap.
