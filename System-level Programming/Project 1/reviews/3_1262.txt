Maybe its me, but Half Life is too crude to be an engaging play.  Been meaning to play it for years, but never got to it.  I played Half Life 2 first, and that is simply the best experience in gameing I've ever had.  It is brilliant.  I can see how 2 is a derivative and continuation of 1.

But after a few hours, I simply could not take the constant jumping/missing/dying.  And the totally totally obscure paths through each scene.  The long passages with no health.  The obscure mazes and constant times of being squished.  After a while, I became so frustrated I simply stopped playing the game.

There were some jump/fall/sqish episodes where replayed the silly jump part over 100 times.  I think that the playability is dated, just like the graphics.  The peculiar movement, where you always run, and have to press shift just to walk and not fall or overshoot where you're trying to get to, is simply not a current way to control movement.

All in all, a charming prequel to the best game ever.  I'm sure this game was truly groundbreaking 7-8 years ago when it first shipped.  But by today's standards, its not for me at least.  I cannot wait for more from Valve, as they are fantastic.  But this one, I'll pass forever
