I got this game  a week ago.  When I first saw this game I thought I was going to like it.  When I popped the c.d in the playstation It was so darn frustrating to control croc.  I only went to the dessert world.  When I was in the ice world I kept losing cuz u go a long way just to get a key to save a freakin gobbo.  Croc for game boy color is much better than the one for playstation.  If u r looking for a really good cute, funny, fun, interesting game get Gex: Enter the gecko.  What I am tring to tell u is that DON'T GET THIS GAME EVER.
