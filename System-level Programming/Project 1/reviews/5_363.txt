When the gamecube came out, we all had 19, 20 or 24 inch CRT televisions.  The standard 6 foot gamecube controller cord was acceptable.  But now that we have these 50+ inch TV screens, 6 feet just doesn't cut it.

I've used 2 of these cables for about 6 months to play games on my gamecube and wii.  Everyday I wrap the cords back up around the controller and tuck it away.  All that twisting of the cords has had no effect on the connectors.  They operate just great.  The 2 pack was enough for me to sit about 15 feet back from the console and still have slack.

I'd recommend this to any gamer that uses their gamecube controller on their wii or gamecube and wants to sit back a bit from their TV.  Their "may" be a wireless alternative to a gamecube controller for these older games, but I couldn't beat the price.  I didn't bother even looking for an alternative.
