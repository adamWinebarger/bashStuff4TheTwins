This is probably one of the best PlayStation One games there is. This has the best storyline of all, again the characters are cool,the music is okay, and the action kind of blows. What I mean is that unlike MGS2, you can't switch to first-person mode and use your gun, and Revolver Ocelot is kind of lame to fight ( chasing someone in circles is not my idea of an exciting gunfight.) and you can't zoom in or out when using the sniper rifle, also can't use it while standing. Still, it is a good game, but the sequel is better. Not a bad game,but could have been improved.
