If you are looking for something new and innovative, this is not it. This is a great Mortal Kombat game, thats all it is. Some of the other reviews here are a little misleading, they are expecting a whole new game. It is a near perfect replication of the arcade version. Characters included: Scorpion, Johnny Cage,Sub Zero, Katana, Mileen. There are even hidden characters to play, I believe Goro, Sector, Noob Saibot. Modes 1vs1 and 2vs2. Only complaint I have is the controls are pretty sensitive, you can't use the analog button, you have to use the regular directional pad, which is a pain in the Thumb. Thank God, I got the Blaze arcade stick, which does wonders for the game. The graphics are nice and so is the sound. The computer is pretty challenging even at the easy level at times, and there is no online play. Go ahead and grab this title (for the price you can't go wrong) and have a Mortal Kombat title for your DC. Gamer247 is OUT! GAME ON! (I actually give it 3 1/2)
