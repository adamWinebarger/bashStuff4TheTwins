This game is good...up to a point.  Like the bots in Quake 3, the senarios are either very easy or very HARD.  I've also noticed that when you start a mission, if you enter the cheat that reveals the whole map, you'll notice  that the enemy always has more than TEN chests of gold and at least FOUR  artifacts right within easy reach!  All this while YOU have to scrounge by  to surivive in the early game!  Later on, when you control vast armies,  which would make Waterloo look like little kids playing War, you'll run  into computers which will, naturally, have armies approximately three times  larger than your own. The game CHEATS!  Trust me, you'll be screaming in  rage too when you enter the scene with twenty of your best units and find  that the computer has seventy of his.  At least it's not as bad as HOMM2,  which had one mission put you up against more than 200 bone dragons!
