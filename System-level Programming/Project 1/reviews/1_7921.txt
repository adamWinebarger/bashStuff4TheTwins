I remember burrowing this from a friend because I ran out of N64 games to play so I burrowed this and some other games for a few days. I have to say it was fun at first, than it became frustrating, and than I felt like I was going to throw up because of the weird controls and this and that moving around in weird places which I didn't intended in doing. It was also because I was really young then and I really didn't know what the game was really about, which is puzzle solving sometimes.

I advise not buying the game, instead tell your friend to buy it because its the best game ever and take it from him when he wants to throw it out. Of course you'll lose a friend, but well worth it! Game > Friendship. I'm just playing kids.
