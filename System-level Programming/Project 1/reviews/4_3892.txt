I play games, simply put.  If I want to play Gran Turismo2, Metal Gear Solid or Final Fantasy 7, 8, or 9, I need a PSX.  If I want to play Phantasy Star4, I need a Sega Genesis.  But in this case, with the Dreamcast consoles' production be halted and for a rather low price (not necessarily through Amazon), it's quite a deal.
The games that I have look very good.  I have found that the Sega products tend to keep a more 'cartoony' style while the PS2 is desperately trying to get the characters to look more human.  (Well, humanoid.  Only Square can do it best...)  I don't have many and that brings up the next case.
Sega honestly doesn't have any games that I really want to play.  Even when first coming out over a year ago, there were few games that really caught my eye.  Carrier was one of them because I thought the premise was better than the Resident Evil games (which I don't care for...).  I needed a fighter and Streetfighter fulfills that.  I have DOA2 on the way, but the game that made me buy the DC was Phantasy Star On-Line.
This review is about the Dreamcast and it IS a worthy machine no matter what anybody says about it.  The problem (and why it receives 4 stars) is that the majority of games are absolute junk.  (I have specific tastes and Sega just doesn't quite cater...  BUT, that's not a bad deal!)
