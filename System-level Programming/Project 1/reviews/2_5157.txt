I enjoy RPG games. Really, I do. But for some reason, I couldn't get into this one as much as I thought I could. But I've looked at all the reviews  on this board, and most are raving about it. But what I'm also wondering is  if these very positive reviews are from mostly die-hard RPGers, and/or  Dungeon & Dragons fans.
I personally do not play D&D, so I'm not  a die-hard. But I did enjoy Diablo, Everquest, Might and Magic 7, and Age  of Wonders, so I'm not against "dungeon-crawl"/fantasy type games  as you may think I am. I did like the "pause" option in Baldur's  Gate, so you can give commands to each of your party's members without  getting thrashed in the meantime, but I didn't care for the graphics. But  to some, that's minor and forgivable if you like the gameplay--I guess I  just didn't. I also prefer faster paced games with a more linear storyline.  But if you prefer a non-linear storyline, and sometimes feeling semi-lost  in a rather large world to explore, that's all the more reason for you to  get this game.
I also get a tired of too much repitition. Every battle I  set my formation up, pause, issue relatively the same commands, and  execute. (In Everquest, I only went up to Level 12 and quit, thinking,  what's the point?) So the combat is repetitive, but in Baldur's defense, it  does have a storyline and an ending, unlike Everquest. But it is time  consuming. But if you can afford the time, and you like RPG's, then you'll  love this title, otherwise, spend your gaming money elsewhere.
