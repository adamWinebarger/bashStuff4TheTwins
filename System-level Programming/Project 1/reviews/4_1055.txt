"Turok 2: Seeds of Evil" has a lot to love about it.  The music rocks.  The graphics are still quite good for N64 standards (especially if you have the Expansion Pak).  It controls just fine (get used to the C-button controls).  There's some good multiplayer.  It's a bloody, gory mess.  And the weapons are freaking awesome (just wait till you see the Cerebral Bore).

But there's a big problem with it: DESIGN

I'm not talking about the art direction or graphical look.  "Turok 2" is still a good-looking game with gruesome enemies and solid lighting effects.  But these levels are confusing as all hell, with the exception of the 1st one.  If we had a better story to go along with it, then maybe there'd be a reason to plow through.  But for whatever reason, Acclaim & Iguana decided to force the player to scour every inch of the 6 levels, and if you're stuck, you're stuck for good.

You will be required to light beacons, find keys, and rescue children.  Again, Level 1 isn't so bad, but Levels 2-6 are gonna be a pain in the butt if you get lost.  The map you're given sucks.  And to make matters worse, you can't leave or quit levels once you've selected them.

But if you're not too proud to grab a strategy guide or go online, then "Turok 2" will be more fun than perhaps some of us had back in 2000.  The combat is still a blast (although the final Primegen boss is impossible without cheat codes).  The presentation is sharp.  And the Turok world is still very unique from today's overload of military/war shooters.

"Turok 2" was one of the N64's most critically-acclaimed titles for the console, rightfully so.  But be warned, it'll test your gaming logic more than you expect.
