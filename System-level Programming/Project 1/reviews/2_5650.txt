This game is terrible, I've seen it for PS, and own it for PC, and I can't stand it!  The graphics are terrible, the gameplay is too similar to Diablo 2, without the fun stuff like the Horodric Cube, or the range of items. Save your money, buy DII and Lord of Destruction... you'll feel better that you didn't waste your money.
