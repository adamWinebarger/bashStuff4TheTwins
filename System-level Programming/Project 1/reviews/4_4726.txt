This was a really fun game to me. I enjoy challenges and puzzles and this game offers many of each. They got the sarcastic one liners of Indy down pretty well, though it would have been a lot cooler if Harrison Ford voiced it. The game has an intriguing story, though somewhat far fetched, but its a game. The graphics were a bit on the mediocre side for the requirements, but it didn't take away from the game play. The controls are good, but I find sometimes they don't respond like they should. My only real complaint is how linear the game is. There is only one way to go and that doesn't make the puzzle solving the most fun sometimes. Good game overall.
