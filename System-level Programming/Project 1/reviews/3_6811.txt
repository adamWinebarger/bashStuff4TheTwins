....oh well. In it's time this game was A+. It's time has passed though. It's still somewhat fun , but graphic's and the like have advanced so far beyond this I don't feel right raving on to hard on it. If it's a bargain priced game or a decent 2nd hand copy it is fun for a run through. The story and difficulty are quite good so that helps it hold up that's a plus.
