I played this game originally on a friend's PC, and it was okay, played this version on my N64 and had to have it... Its much better graphics wise and blood and guts wise than the original Quake.  Also, beats the crap out of DOOM64 by a long margin.  You have to have it to believe it.  I am hooked, now Im getting off my computer and playing some quake with my buds.  Did I mention you can play more than one player?  and you can play against each other too?  YOU CAN
