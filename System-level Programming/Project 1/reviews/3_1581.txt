A password feature. Graphics that are lacking for the PS1 era.

There is no saving in this game at all. The original PC version, which I own 2 copies of, as well as DOOM 64, DOOM 2, and DOOM 3, all have saving features. Not only that, but the teatures are very gradient, reminiescent of the old 3D Maze screensavers on older Windows machines. The graphics could have been smoothed out a bit more. There are games on the PS1 library that have better graphics, and on the original DOS version of DOOM, there were better graphics.

The controls are responsive and fluid, the music is damn awesome, the game comes in a special padded longbox, the gameplay is fun (but repetitive, due to the password system that sucks), and the level design is excellent. There are more postives than neagtives when regardring DOOM on the PS1, but the negatives are major screwups that irritate me. It's a great game, but i recommend not buying this port. Go play DOOM on an ATM or something (DOOM on an ATM: https://youtu.be/D0rStdHowAg?t=7m16s).
