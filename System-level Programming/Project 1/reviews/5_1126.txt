I love all the Mario Kart games, this one has some of the coolest tracks.  Yoshi Valley is the best track I've ever played and the graphics are pretty good too.  Small selection of characters (if you've got the one for Gamecube) but still a blast.  Awesome 1 player or multiplayer game, a must have for parties!  Good anytime and that's hard to find.
