Frogger is another one of those classic arcade games that any gamer should jump into. Whether it's on the old-school Atari 2600, or in one of the many game collections being released in recent times, Frogger is a game that should have been played at least once in one's lifetime.

This Game Boy version, however, isn't all that amazing. The graphics look very shrunken down, with the color just looking odd, and the catchy music of the original seems to be nearly absent, as the first few notes only play as intro music. Otherwise, it's still that arcade classic on the go.

But honestly, there are much better versions or games of Frogger. The Sega Genesis version is EXACTLY like the arcade game (Everything's untouched), and the Playstation version is a whole adventure, but stays true to the classic gameplay. Speaking of which, Frogger 2 is the best pick for Frogger on the go. See my review for that one.
