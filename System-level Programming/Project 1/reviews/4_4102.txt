The first foremost negative aspect about this game is the fact that it doesn't really have a soundtrack. It's only got two songs on the CD and this is quite a shock and disapointment since, for example, Mechwarrior 2: Mercenaries had a full, awesome soundtrack. Nevertheless, the 2 songs seemlesly integrate themselves into the feeling and the repeats aren't that noticeable.

The game has a good plot, good graphics and good action. In multiplayer it's even better, but the system of finding a server could have been easier and more straight-forward. Matching is done via a Microsoft website where you can find games and chatrooms and you also need to have installed Zonematch, a small program similar to MSN Messenger. In my opinion everything should be incorporated into an in-game multiplayer interface, just like the majority of other titles out there.

You, along with other troops are sent on a mission to neutralize enemy forces occupying a planet. As you reach orbit the dropships are shot down by enemy forces. You have to fight your way through, meet up with your other lancemates that were also shot down and find a way to get off the planet alive while at the same time driving to accomplish your mission.

The game puts you in the cockpit of awesome, powerful, 80-ton humanoid warmachines with enough firepower to level a city. The array of mechs and arsenal won't disappoint. Customize your warmachine any way you want and take it to the battlefield.

I especially like the mission commentaries, video feeds and voice acting, they're very well done and really help create the overall atmosphere.

BE ADVISED! The game out of the box may have slight incompatibility issues with Windows XP especially if you have Service Pack 2 installed, so make sure you grab yourself the latest game update patch from the internet! Once patched it runs without any problems.
