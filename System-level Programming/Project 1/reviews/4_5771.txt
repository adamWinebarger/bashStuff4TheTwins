Okay I use to have Harvest Moon for the GBC and in the game you talk to alot of people you get a pet and you do a bunch of farming all in all it's a really great game and can be played on the GBC, Original GBA, and GBA SP.  So if you like farming and talking in games then get this game you'll really enjoy when I first got this game from a friend I couldn't put it down for almost over a month.  Oh and plus there's a photo album in the game that you have to play the game for a while to unlock each picture and if you have a Game Boy Printer which you can get off here amazon then you can print out your pictures and you can play as a girl or a boy in the game.
