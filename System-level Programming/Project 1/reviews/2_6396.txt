this is the worst final fantasy game gameplay wise without a doubt.  not only is the learning curve hours, but after that, you have to spend hours getting magic from the enemies to use and equip.  This game graphic wise looks like it has been in work for a lifetime, and the FMV looks like PS2 or DC.  the gameplay looks like it was made in a lifetime too, and that is a BAD thing.
