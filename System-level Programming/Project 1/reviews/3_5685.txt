Metal Gear Solid has won just about every gaming award possible and has been lauded by critics and fans worldwide.  Despite the fact it's not really my area of interest (I'm a Resident Evil type guy) I bought the game (heck, it was 20 bucks, why not?).  This was last year.  I never finished it, and finally sold it.  Why?  Good question.  I finally decided that, ultimately, I wasn't involved at all with any of the characters or story events.  I didn't care what happened.  Do I think MGS is overrated?  Well, sort of.  Granted, the graphics, controls, and audio are as perfect as perfect can get, and there is no doubt that there are innovative elements (especially the sneaking about and the enemy soldier AI) but I found the characters and story as cold and sterile as the Arctic location in which most of the game is set.  It has no SOUL.  For this type of game, I feel this kind of personal involvement is VITAL. I wasn't swept up in the events like in Parasite Eve or Vagrant Story.  Metal Gear left me with the feeling I was performing a chore rather than embarking on a world-changing adventure.  The story felt scripted and unnatural, the characters flat and lifeless.  I think Metal Gear affected me the same way as this year's Shenmue for Dreamcast:  an undisputed technical masterpiece that felt devoid of humanity.  In any case, any gamer with a pulse should play through it (for the Sniper Wolf bits if nothing else), but be prepared for Snake and Co. to keep a distance from your heart.
