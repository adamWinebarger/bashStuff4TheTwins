WWF Attitude, although a good game don't get me twisted, was not worth it on the Playstation because of the incredible loading time. ... Seriously, if you picked Owen Hart, Gangrel, Road Dogg or even Kane or the Undertaker, you had to wait atleast 2 sometimes exceeds of 3-4 minutes just to get a match started. And if you picked a hardcore or cage match, sometimes, you had to wait even longer.
The trade off was truly not worth it for me because of that reason. Granted yes what you got on the Playstation version rather than the N64 version was better. PSone had more sounds, more create a wrestler options in the voice and music and some clothes. Because of PSone's memory capability, the game could have more and that was a definite plus over the 64.
I will admit that once you got the match started on the PSone version, the game itself was faster than N64's version but still, anyone could appreciate not having to wait 5 Minutes to play a simple game. The controls can be a little challenging at first but once you get it, you're golden and you don't have to worry about a thing.
For the game itself I will give a 4 star because it is still a fun game to play with your friends but because of the awful loading and wait time I give WWF Attitude a zero. ...
