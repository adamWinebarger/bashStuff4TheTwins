I'll admit, the first time I ever played this game, I wasn't that into it. The main reason was that there, in my opinion, too many damn mini-games that were kinda hard (I STILL can't figure out how to get in line with the soldiers at the parade in I think Junon). Also, the music, while very emotional, is very very sad. So is the story... it got a little depressing to me.

But that was the first time I played it. Now I'm playing it again (this is my third time and I just beat the game about 6 months ago), and I'm finding the mini-games aren't quite as difficult; I'm not getting lost nearly as much, and I've gotta say the music's not quite so depressing anymore either. Also, I think it helps to play Crisis Core (PSP prequel to the game) or at least watch Advent Children (movie whose plot takes place about 2 years after the events of the PS game). The story is still quite sad, but it works. I think anyone who is into RPGs will definitely enjoy this one.
