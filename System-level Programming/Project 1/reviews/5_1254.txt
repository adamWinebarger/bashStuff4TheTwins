I have played all the other Zelda Series Games and this is the best.  I first heard of this game when I borrowed it from a friend.  I played it nonstop, until I beat the game.  The only hard part about it is the dreaded Water Temple.  It is the only actual hard one, but don't get me wrong the rest of the dungeons are equally difficult.  Even the first level is as difficult because you have only your sword, shield and wits.  But as you progress you gain pieces of hearts, weapons, swords, shields, and other tools.  The graphics are really cool, the sound could be just a tad better, and the fun is the best.  The only bad part is you can't unfreeze Zora's Domain and get the Triforce, or Miyamoto says.  Well if you liked the other Zelda games, this is a must have.  If you never have played a Zelda game get a life!
