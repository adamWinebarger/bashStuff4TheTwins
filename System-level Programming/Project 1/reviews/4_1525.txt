This is a great classic game that basically revolutionized Nintendo 64 but there is only one problem. It is WAY too easy to beat. But I guess since it's an old game I can see why.
Basically the "mission" is to recover all the 120 stars and save the Princess from the evil "Bowser." It's really easy and you can beat the game in about a month. Even though I have plenty of Nintendo games, I still go back to this game once in awhile because it's a classic favorite. Many current Nintendo games can't compete against it. If only this game was a bit more challenging!! I think all new Nintendo 64 buyers should get this as there first game because you can explore alot with controls and skills that'll help you out in more challenging games.
Any fans of Mario, or Nintendo genre would like this game. As far as kids, there isn't much violence in this game. No blood, or gorey actions. The price is pretty ok, and the game's plot is pretty ok. There are many courses and places to explore so if you are a slow player it'll take some time. After you complete the game, you'll still be going back to it. Seeing that my brothers and I already beat it over 10 times, we're finally getting tired of it!
