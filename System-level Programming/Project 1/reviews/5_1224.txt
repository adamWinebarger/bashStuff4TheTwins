Hey all you people, this game is an absolute good. Barely any flaws and it is like you are playing the game in reality. This is a 5 star game. Why, you ask? This is the proof:
1. Gameplay- It takes you a while to master the controls and stuff, but with practice, this wouldn't be frustrating at all!
2. Graphics- Great! As I said, everything is 3-D like the Deku Tree and Link himself. Take a look!
3. Lifespan- I heard that people who knows Zelda games really well could beat this in a week. But you guys out there that is starting a new adventure, would last forever for no boring parts of the game. There is a lot of words to say, but its worth it.
4. Fun-This game is a 99.8 fun game, in my opinion of course. I am stuck on the Deku tree of how to get past the spiders. See, challenging, and fun!
5. Sound-You gotta be kidding me! The Sound and music is great! Different sounds occur in different environments for the better!
Listen Closely!
6. Overall- This game is an absolute no miss game! Guranteed. This is a good game who likes RPG, or collects Zelda Games. This is, (I think) better than Majora's Mask. This Game Follows the Legend!!! Honestly.
