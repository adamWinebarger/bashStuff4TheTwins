This game is medicore. At first it seems good, but after a while, you get more and more things happening to you. Certian comp. allies always turn on you. The graphics are okay. the sound is something that you will turn off and listen to a CD instead. The controls are ok, and all together everything is fine, it just doesnt mix at all. You will soon leave it on you stack of computer games and will play more dencent games like Starcraft. i havnt played it in at least a month, and you shouldnt waste your hard earned cash for it. the history is great and makes sense, but after a space you get sick of all the same units; 14 civilazations all only 1 tech tree. They just make certian Civs. not able to get some units. Its sad. Now if youll excuse me, i have a good game to play called Total Annihilation. . .
