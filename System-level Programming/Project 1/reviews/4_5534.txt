I am a long-time M&M devotee. I played every game of this gorgeous series. On the last M&M 6, it is put on a new high level. But in this sequel, it seems to do the same thing without new surprise. To be fair,  this game is still lots of fun. I like the storyline very much--- in the  game, whevever you are so careful, you MUST choose your route between good  or evil, and then become the foe and the killer of the other side. This is  life. And numerous quests make you always has something to do. The most  disadvantage of this game is the unnecessary lots of monsters. I hate  myself doing the same thing again and again, accept a guest, kill the  monsters, get the item. (In fact I am not killing the monster, I'm killing  my time....) If 3DO company know this, this game and the following  sequels(M&M 8,9,10,...) would be far more better. (But alas, I just  purchased a copy of M&M 8, and the monsters seem to be even far more.)
