When EA sports got the rights to WCW I guess they thought about how to do it, do they go with the way THQ did it, or the way ACCLIAM would? They seemed to be able to make a graphic that is in between both designs! It's kind of the THQ game play with WWF Attitudes graphics in a way. The graphics of the wrestlers and motion in this game look like Attitudes style only they look stupid, each character looks like a big head on a small body with skinnier legs, they look like they are going to start hopping around the ring like a rabbit or a kangaroo or something.

The game has so many flaw...

- No costume change for any wrestler.
- Cant edit wrestlers
- Created wrestlers cannot have there moves chosen individually. You have to select a pre programmed set of moves from one of the existing wrestlers in the game. And you cant even select a different finishing move which is stupid because it shows an option to change it but if you change it to say the Jacknife Powerbomb then it will change the previous move list to that of Kevin Nash.
- Too many moves are wrong, not done right, given to the wrong wrestler ect and high flyers like Rey Mysterio don't have off the rope moves or anything, there basically grounded. or moves are missing, hogans leg drop is not a finisher, Nash doesnt do that size up thing in the corner, scott hall has no choke slam, lex luger has no torture rack, sting does headscissors, but its the wrong headscissors, he does a cruiserweight one instead of the regular one, randy savage doesnt raise his arms on the top rope elbow, god knows what else is missing.
- Moves just become repeated and it gets boring. Every charactor feels about the same to control.
- It sucks to only be able to hit your opponent with a weapon 2 or 3 times before they block it (every time, no joke) the weapons don't consist much more then chairs and bats.
- Going backstage is nothing special. 4 weapons and nowhere to go but back to ring side.
- The codes are annoying to have to put in up to 15 digit codes every time you wanna access it - meaning you have to put them in each match, then once you finish you have to put them in again.
- There has been little attention payed by the creators to the background.
- Everything is too programmed. You figure out right away that eventually you can hit your opponent twice on the ground before they get up and finishing moves don't mean your opponent will stay down like they should. I did a 3-way match and dropped about a million diamond cutters on them and they get up right away.
- Only one special move for each wrestler. And all are done the same way in a grapple, which means wrestlers like Bret Hart and Stings Sharpshooter are not there finishers!
- You can only select about 5 tunes for a CAW's ring music.
- The entrances are very dodgy.
- The commentary becomes VERY annoying after you've heard it repeated 1000 times in the one match.
- CAW can't choose attires from the other wrestlers, or a moustache like Hogan to make a CAW version of the yellow and red Hogan.
- A lot of moves are missing; Booker T's axe kick finisher thing, Bret Harts 'hart attack', double team moves, ways to turn your opponent around to grabble them from behind, Hogan's big boot, there is only one pin unless it's a move - not one of them hooks the leg or anything unless it's a move given to them, taunts are missing, entrance taunts are wrong or missing.
- It's another game that has completely ignored Hulk Hogan's Leg Drop as being a devastating finisher, it's simply just a running leg drop that doesn't even look like the height Hogan would do it from and I don't know if I've ever seen Hogan pull off a standing drop kick before. It's just an average leg drop with little damage.
- all the backstage rooms are the same, there just a diffrent picture on the walls which is boring.
- Goldberg's not only in the game, but also on the damn cover.
And finally, it's WCW.

My recommendation is WWF NO MERCY. However the WCW fan may prefer WCW/NWO Revenge. THQ made the better wrasslin' games on the 64. Stick with them.
