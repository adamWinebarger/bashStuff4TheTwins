Do you really need a review? If you loved Diablo, you'll probably love Diablo 2. It's the same hack-things-up-and-revel-in-the-bloodshed good clean fun of the original, but a whole lot bigger. Everything about it is wonderful... except the save game "feature." And that's bad enough to knock my rating down two stars. Now, when you save, you're forced to exit the game, and you start back in the main city where you begin whichever act you happen to be in. If you're between "waypoints" (and there are sometimes rather large expanses between waypoints, especially in Act III), there's no easy method for saving. It seems Blizzard forgot computers are used for playing anything but Diablo, and thus didn't feel the need to create a game that can be saved when necessary. If you can get past that, though, it's just as much fun whacking monsters as it always was. (The nod to Trilogy of Terror is also wonderful. Take a real close look at the Rat Men/Soul Killers, then go watch Trilogy of Terror...)
