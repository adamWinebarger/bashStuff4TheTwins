If you are a lawsuit happy whacko stay away from this one. It's not for the family, unless you happen to be in the Manson family! This game is a one player, 1st person shooter. There is a cable link option and if you are  lucky enough to have two TVs, two game consols and two game CDs then you  can have some real battles (same goes for the original DOOM)as you blast  your way through violent, disguised communists or declare war on your  playing partner. There are several levels and most get a little tougher as  you finish each level. The music can be turned off to make the setting even  more realistic. Lots of suprises and weapons keep this body count classic  fresh. Nothing like a point blank double barrel shotgun blast to the face  to really make you mad! A great deal at this price for sure.
