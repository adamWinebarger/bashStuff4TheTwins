I hated WCW Mayhem for a lot of reasons. One, way too much production level was spent on making the characters look good and they still looked awful. The Create A Wrestler was a total pain. Why? Because if you picked certain items of clothing for a wrestler, it didn't match and he looked stupid. Honestly, if you picked Nash's pants, you either had to be skins on top or wear his tank top as well because nothing else matched or looked right. That and you didn't get to pick any of their moves. Again, another F- for effort.
Basically all you did was create a new non-matching-outfit-having wrestler with someone else's moves. Bad. Very bad. So bad that's why WWF Warzone never did that type of Create a Wrestler ever again. And not saying that WWF Attitude was the heart stopping game that it was supposed to be, but at least they learned their lesson and never did that type of Create a Wrestler option.
The grappling totally ate. I was basically kicking, punching and occassionally jumping off the top rope in an attempt to win. I could not get the grapping. It was seriously that bad. Every now and then, I'd pull off a little something, but after that one time, I could never replicate the move. Again another G- for effort (the grading was so low that I couldn't even give it an F because it was that bad).
I wouldn't waste time or money on this title. I still think the better N64 wrestling game was WCW/NWO or WCW Revenge. If you really want to play this bad attempt, then go ahead but I won't be responsible when after you play it, realize that it WAS THAT BAD and throw it out the window.
