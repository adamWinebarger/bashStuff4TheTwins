This is a very pretty game. The graphics were top of the line when this title was released and it still looks very nice. However, the strength of the first 4 Wing Commanders was the storyline. The filmed scenes in WCIII  and WCIV told interesting stories that brought you into the game. The  filmed scenes in this version serve little to move the story along and are  a waste (I am sure they cost quite a bit to make). Furthermore the missions  are fairly repetitious - you are either in a dogfight or on a bombing run.  Try Independence War if you want a challenging space sim or X-Wing Alliance  or Freespace if you want a more traditional but fun space shooter.
