This would have been an absolutely brilliant game if the difficulty level had been low and if the controls had been good. Otherwise it's a great game. The graphics are superb,the sound effects are done quite well. The FMV sequences in between the stages are stunning. The first stage isn't tough to beat ,but from thereon it becomes quite tough and frustating at times. The controls aren't that easy to master. But all in all still a welcome addition to the MK series.
