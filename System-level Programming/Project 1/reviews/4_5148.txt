After this game I played Diablo. Diablo is not a bad game,but Baldur's Gate makes it look like Pong. This is the best AD&D game iv've ever played (and I play a lot).
Baldur's Gate is about a kid (played by you) who grows up in Candle keep,under the kind tutelage of his foster father,Gorion. After a couple of years growing up,Gorion wants to move away. You don't know why. In about 20 minutes into the game (that's how long it took me)Gorion gets killed in a horrid battle by mercenaries. You must avenge him. But,after traveling and making friends (and making enemies),you find out your dark secret.
Very addictive game. Yet the computer was going through hell. That's the only problem.
Buy this if you liked Lotr!(Lord of the Rings)!
