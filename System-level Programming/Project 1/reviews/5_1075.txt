My N64, it acts like a rock sitting right there under my tv. I bought a total of 8 count em 8 games on this pathetic system (I have what about 60 for my computer). But this game made me believe that a good shooter could be made on consoles (although very few of the ports from pc to consoles are, usually the original games for the consoles are good.)Of those 8 games I have, this one is worth about 10. The makers of this game are geniuses and have spread that on to other games like the timesplitters series (if there is any game that will make me buy a gamecube, besides metroid prime, it IS timesplitters 2. It is a master peace that will be lived on in my memories and it will remain stuck in my damn cartrage slot of my forgotten n64, or it would be forgotten, if not for this game
