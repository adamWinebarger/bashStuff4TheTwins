There are secret ways to unlock alternate versions of some of the characters, and even unlock Onslaught. You'll have to beat the game using certain techniques. In order to beat the game very easily, I personally found it best to use Ryu and Venom on Easy mode. Use them to beat the game multiple times and you'll be able to unlock all of the secret characters.

PROS:
1) The vibration feedback is extremely sensitive !!! You feel every bump and hit that you give your opponent.
2) There is an Easy mode, which strangely is not in MvC part 2. The Easy mode allows you to use Chun Li's lighting fast kicks.
3) There are a few super moves that are not in MvC part 2. Like Chun Li's has four supers in this game, while she has only three in part 2.

CONS:
1) There is a little slow-down with a few characters like War Machine and Strider. These characters move a lot faster in MvC part 2.
2) You can not select the same person twice. In MvC part 2, you are allowed to select the same person so you may have a team of three Akumas or whomever else.

Overall, it's a great game, and I urge you to buy it even if you already own MvC part 2. I own both games and love them equally.
