I like this game overall, but as you can see by the other reviews, it does have its flaws.  What I liked about the game is just the mere fact that it is rather time consuming.  You don't just put it in and win.  You have to think and manage your planets carefully.  The "normal" skill level is just way to hard to be "normal".  I haven't even wanted to try to play it under "hard".  Why bother when I can't even beat it under normal.
I myself haven't had any problems with memory.  But, I can't see a lot of the text when the starfield is on.  This makes it hard to use the quick research function.  The text is there, just can't read it.  And it's not that I have a slow system, it's a brand new 866.
I also think this game is very much like Master of Orion, just not as good.  Well, maybe they will come out with another version of Master of Orion for us.
