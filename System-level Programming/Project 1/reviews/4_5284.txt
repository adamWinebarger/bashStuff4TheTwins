This game fetches for hundreds of dollars nowadays, but with that said, this is a pretty good game. You have a plot that interconnects with 108 different characters that can be recruited at their perspective times, but unless you are a completionist, you will be extremely disappointed in the ending you will get. Now, whether or not you want to spend $100 on this is entirely up to you. I spent it, and I felt I somewhat got my money's worth, but at the same time, a little disappointed that I spent this much on a game, but oh well, there is worse, like $400 for Panzer Dragoon Saga. Anyways, just like with any other Suikoden entry, you can go to war with the kingdom whom the main character is opposing with, and use all kinds of tactics in battle that will determine your fate. The story is pretty solid, and the character development is also quite solid as well, and you have a lot of lush, beautiful environments to traverse through, with a world map. Overall, this game is good, but be prepared to drop a fraction of your wallet if you want this.
