When it first came out, the graphics for this game were state-of-the-art. Now they are not good. The gameplay is very forgetable as well, it plays like a futuristic Tomb Raider with lousy puzzles.
The only possible reason to buy this game is that the voice of Blasto is done by the great Phil Hartman.
