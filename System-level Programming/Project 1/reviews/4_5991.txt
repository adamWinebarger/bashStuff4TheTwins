Mortal Kombat Mythologies Subzero is perhaps one of the most underrated games in the Mortal Kombat lineage. The gameplay is not too far off from MK3. The only issue with gameplay is the turn around button. Otherwise it plays just like 3 with platforming. The story is excellent, although some cinemas seem a bit campy. The difficulty is a bit ramped up, which is annoying, but the story is worth the aggravation.
