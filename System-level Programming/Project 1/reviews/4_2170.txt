Unlike some other reviewers I actually found that this game was enjoyable. The only complaint I have is that the graphics looked like they belonged to a Super Nintendo. Besides that the game is awesome.
 The basic outline of the game is that you race the USA from California to Washington DC. Each level gets harder as you pass along but not to worry. Once you get the hang of the game you will beat the level after a few tries. Each time you complete the whole entire racee (California to D.C.) you will earn a faster car.
 So, all in all Crus n' USA is a pretty enjoyable game. Buy and enjoy.
HAPPY GAMING!
