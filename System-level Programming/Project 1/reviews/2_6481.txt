This game would have been a MASTERPIECE, had it have not been for the stupidity of blizzard. This game WOULD be extremely fun, but there is one flaw, and this one flaw ruins how much I enjoyed the game: The damn saving option. This really pissed me off. After a hard 3 hours straight of battling, you find out you have to run off to work, so you save and quit the game. After a hard 8 hours of work, you look forward to playin the pretty fun game of Diablo 2 once again. you pop the Cd in the drive, start up the game....WHAT THE HELL?? I JUST BEAT ALL THESE ENEMIES! yes that is right. After you save and quit, the enemies return. sure, its a good way to earn experience, but i think it goes a little too far when you have to defeat about 200 enemies and spend about an hour JUST to get back to where you left off on your last play. At first it's not that bad, mainly because the enemies are not that hard, and there are not many of them. but once i got to the third act, i got so frustrated i just quit the game and didn't play it for a month. This gets so frustrating and time-consuming it is unreal.
I loved the first Diablo, and right after i beat it i went out and bough diablo 2 with an expansion pack RIGHT AWAY, expecting this FANTASTIC game, and all i got was a 3 hour excitement from the first 2 acts. Now, i am going to auction it off of ebay as quick as possible, as the sight of the box i have reminds me of the mistake i made of spending a total of 40 dollars on such crap
