The graphics are mediocre, the fog and pop-up are dire, and the cars handle like wet fish, but the best thing about SF Rush remains the wonderful track designs, full of wild jumps and shortcuts.  The tracks are  faithful to their arcade counterparts, so if you want to go under the truck  and jump on top of the buildings on track two, go for it.
