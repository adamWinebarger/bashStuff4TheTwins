great graphics, not enough action.  the whole game is basically collecting golden bananas to unlock worlds to collect more bananas.  It is a good game however and is a steal at the price amazon is selling it for.  it is identical to banjo-kazooie/tooie, so if you played those games and hated them or are tired of them, don't buy dk64,  personally  i found dk country more fun on snes, but that is just me.
