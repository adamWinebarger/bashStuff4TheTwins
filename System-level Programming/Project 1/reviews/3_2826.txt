Having the rare opportunity of trying it out, the Game Boy Color is a considerable leap from its predecessor.  Besides the main feature of processing 32,000 colors with specially designed games, the GBC is backwards compatible with classic monochrome Game Boy titles, though you can play with different palettes by tinkering with the face buttons when the title screen appears.  Also, though the system's slimmed-down design is pretty convenient for pocket games, it's a bit too narrow for big hands.  It offers no shortage in battery power, and the AC outlet at the bottom provides extended play with the right adapter.  The biggest oddity on the handheld (for me) is that you raise the volume by turning the switch down instead of up.  As for the GBC's less-than-stellar resolution, after discovering the Japanese-exclusive Game Boy Light, there's no excuse for having to find a proper light source.

This system is recommended for players over 7.
