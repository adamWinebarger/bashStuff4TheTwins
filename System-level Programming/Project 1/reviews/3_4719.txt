As an experience, Microsoft's 'Combat Flight Simulator' is rather akin to watching your parents dance - it's an attempt to inject some fun into the  staid 'Flight Simulator' series, and whilst it retains all the virtues of  the longest-running flight sim series ever, it doesn't totally work, being  not much fun to play as a game. The presentation is solid, and extremely  unspectacular - the graphics are very rough, and the sound is nothing to  write home about, although the trails of debris that fall from the back of  enemy aircraft is attractive. You can choose to fly a limited set of single  missions (some of which seem oddly hard, simply because you don't have  enough ammunition to destroy your assigned targets), or a 'campaign', but  disappointingly the 'campaign' is just a set of single missions, one after  the other, generating no atmosphere at all. It isn't a patch on the  campaign mode in Microprose's 'European Air War', or the modern 'Falcon 4',  in which the course of a war is modelled and remembered from mission to  mission. The end result is that the game quickly becomes quite monotonous,  and with no real incentive for you to do well from mission to mission the  thought of taking off for another round of bomber interception palls.  Special mention must be made of the manual, which, 'DiD'-style, has lots  and lots of information, but doesn't actually tell you much about flying,  fighting, and most importantly dropping bombs.
That said, all of Europe  is modelled, and if you have the time you can try flying from London to  Paris by landmarks and compass, if you so desire. And a thriving community  of 'Flight Sim' buffs will ensure that the CD you get in the box is only  the start of an ongoing affair.
