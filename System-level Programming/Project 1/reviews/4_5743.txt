First off im just gonna say that this game is very weird, one of the most unique games ever. You will probably never play any game like this unless there is a sequel. This is because of the way you learn new spells, you date women! This is very funny because of what they ask and their different reactions, and it is in dialogouge and interactive anime! My complaints are in the battle system factor, it is just kinda dumb. Your three characters are lined up in a row and when on dies the other comes in, so you only fight with one character at a time. This game is very fun, and it can help all those desperate guys out there who aren't gettin' any action. ^_^
