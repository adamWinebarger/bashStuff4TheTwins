The only diabolical thing about this game is how bad it is. Blizzard's strategy is this: make the game so much fun in the beginning that you sell lots o copies and than later it is no more fun. They make more money faster that way. But wasting money for this game which you will shelf after realizing there's nothing more to do is a bad idea. Hack, slash, pick up, hack slash, level up, pick up, hack, slash, player killer, hack, slash, kill, level up. That's how i can describe the game. Do yourself a favor, if you're a hack and slasher buy a hack and slasher that is actual FUN and doesn't try to be something it's not. RPG fans should really turn away from this.
