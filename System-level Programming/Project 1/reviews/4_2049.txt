I love this game.  The characters are cute, they make great noises, and there are lots of worlds to explore.  It's really hard to die too, so you could concievably play without a memory card.  What I don't like about it is that Spyro is a little hard to control compared to today's games, and a lot of parts are highly frustrating.  Thieves have stolen a bunch of dragon eggs and you have to chase them down and get the eggs back, but this is MUCH easier said than done.  I have spent hours chasing these guys on some levels.  I mean, I wouldn't want the game to be too easy, but this is borderline ridiculous.  But it's still a really great game and I absolutely fell in love with it.  I'd recomend it to people who love cute things and have infinite patience.
