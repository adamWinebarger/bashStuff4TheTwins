they sacrificed the create a character mode but in its place are like oodles of wrestlers.this game was made during one of wrestlings hottest eras.probably still is.so the wcw had lots o cash to hire lots o wrasslers and thats why theres zillions of them up for grabs.theres the regular wcw guys,the nwo,luchadors,ravens flock,japanese superstars,losers youve never heard of before,and every other gang from that time.the only real problem is the game is very simple to beat.now im not normaly one to complain about easy video games but this game got beat literaly in under 4 hours after i bought it on every level.its better if you're getting this for a kid i guess.
