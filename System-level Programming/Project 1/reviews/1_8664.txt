This was the most boring game I've ever bought.  Don't let the description of multiple games with multiple characters fool you.  It's one game that you go through with various times with different characters.  The valiant  effort of a very non-linear storyline was marred by the fact that it was so  non-linear that the stories were often left being incoherent.  It's tedious  going through the same mini-quests over and over.  Most of the characters  could have been a good choice to have their own full game.
This was a  good idea, playing through multiple games where you meet up with past  characters that you played, but the games needs a huge overhaul in order to  give it more variety.
If you have a LOT of time to kill and are very  easily amused and find this game for very cheap, give it a whirl.  Otherwise, find a decent game or play Final Fantasy VII for the 10th time.  It will be much more interesting.
