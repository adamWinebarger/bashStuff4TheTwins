$43...As I write my review the game is selling for $43.  I sold my copy 4 months ago on here for 9.99 and it wasn't the lowest price.  What the heck is going on here.  Clearly the folks paying the silly price have not seen the gameplay or read a correct unbiased review.  I purchased my copy on clearance (I was the original owner) for 1.99 back in the day and even then I thought I overpaid.  The storyline is vague, the characters are too similar and from what I could stand...the same scene appears to take place with different baddies over and over again.  And this game is $43??
