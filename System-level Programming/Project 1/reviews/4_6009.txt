the only reson i got this controller becuse it was the only ones they got and I don't want to wait to go out of town to get a fist party I don't like how it feels pushing both triggers down and hard to remove the vmu other than that it fine but I worried it will brake in like 2 to 3 years time. LIke my firends the had mad catz controler for play station they said it us mess up after a few weeks with the lights .But hoppfuly this will last mush long senic the it has progarm abliy they had to use better parts the psx mad catz controller do not summerised in one intergated chup like the fist parties do .If can get a fist party controller get it they last for very time .
