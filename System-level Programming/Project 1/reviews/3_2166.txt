The solo game is the cheapest, most annoying game to play.  The computer flat out cheats, and it's totally agonizing to watch the computer play it's mini games and take their endless turns.
With some friends, it's more fun since you can make fun of each other when you lose.  If fact, I'll only play that can with at least two other people.  I suggest a rental as long as you have a group of friends to play with.
