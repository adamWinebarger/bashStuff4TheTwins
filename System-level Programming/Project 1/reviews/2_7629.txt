After I saw the movie I was in a real "X-Men" mood so I went out and bought this game. When I started playing it I became very frustrated. It doesn't show you how to do any of the moves in the instruction book (not that I ever need an instruction book to learn moves). To do moves in this game it takes a lot of practice. So to find out how to do anything with a character you have to go into this boring and frustrating training mode. Once you master a character it is then easy to complete the game. But then, if you want to play another character, you have to go back into the training mode all over again. The endings in this game are very short and unsatisfying. The good thing is that after you have beaten the game with everybody you can view each ending linked up together and then it makes a lot more sense and you get more satisfaction. There's lot of things to unlock in this game but no codes. No secret characters. The worse part about this game is the gameplay. I recently went back to play this game after not playing it for about a year. I found out that I had forgotten to do all of the moves. So rather than go back into training mode I just turned it off and put it anyway. I'll probably never play it again.
