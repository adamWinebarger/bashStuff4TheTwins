The flagship game of Playstation. This is what introduced millions of future gamers and PS-loyalists that Playstation wasn't messing around when it came to the seriousness that was their gaming system.

The gameplay is pretty straight forward. You run around 3D designed levels, breaking objects and defeating enemies all the while trying to progress to your arch-nemsis - Dr. Cortex - with the hope of saving your friend.

The game was met with great success and spouted off several sequels, but for some reason it doesn't really have a presence beyond PS2. There were hopes, and rumors, that Crash was once again going to be the flagship game for PS4, but that wasn't the case.

The game, although pretty average today, set the tone for future launch titles. I definitely suggest it if you are a PS historian or enthusiast.
