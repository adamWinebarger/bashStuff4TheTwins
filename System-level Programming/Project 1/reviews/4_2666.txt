My brother and I rented this game numerous times and in the end finally decided to buy it. It is actually quite fun to play, with many arenas and many of the famous characters from Nintendo. Each character basically has their own arena, and all of the arenas have their advantages and disadvantages. This game is especially recommended as a gift for a child.
What I love about this game is that you can play with as many computers as you want, and they can be against you, or if you want to have fun they can be on your team. You can have timed battles or die from losing lives.
Pros:
1) Fun multiplayer action
2) Computer feature is great---you can set computers skill level
3) Good training level, where you can control many things, and add items and make the computer do things to help you train
4) Just Great!!
Cons:
1) Certain characters are hard to get (like Ness)
2) Less advanced than Super Smash Bros Melee
3) Controls are sometimes difficult
This is a great gift for anyone who is young (especially) and for anyone with a N64.
