but still one of the best! tho i wouldnt bother buying this now, mainly bekause quake 4 is gonna kome out sooner or later (and it looks awesome). i still play this game! konsidering how old this game is, u gotta give it some kredit. the graphiks tho now beat by doom3 and halo2, etc. are really not bad. the game maintains the klassik evil statanik kastle type maps, which in my opinion, bring out the fear and the "kill or be killed" type atmosphere. and the bots! this may be bekause of the way the maps are very konfined, but i find the bots in this game much harder to beat kompared to the bots in the ut series. and wahts more u kan sometimes seem to grasp what even sounds like a konversation with some of the bots like "Crash". this is very unlike singleplayer ut, where u never touch the chat button. try it out it kan be funny, tho it usually doesnt work. The weapons are simple and easy to use, some sekondary fire would be interesting tho. a few weapons needed in my opinion are mines (maybe molotov kocktails), flamethrowers, and the ol nailgun. i kant komment on multiplayer, it doesnt seem to work on my komputer but neway i kno that ut has the best online gaming (unless kounterstrike is better, ive never tried that one).  if u don't have this game now, i suggest u download the demo, its basikally all u need. it has the only map i play singleplayer "Q3DM17" i think... however. another good thing about this game is the fakt that there are so many mods! "modifikations" tho now i would suggest people to buy ut2004, (it has the best mods) quake III has kountless downloadable skins, maps, etc, etc, etc. this game is a klassik.
