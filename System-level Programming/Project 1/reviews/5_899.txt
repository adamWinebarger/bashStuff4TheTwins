I am a major player of 007 games. I have played nearly every single one, but I have to say, GoldenEye is one of the best that there is, even years and platforms later. Even though I have a GameCube with all of the other 007 games, I still to this day find myself returning to play a round of Goldeneye.

GoldenEye has a great plotline (in my opinion, even better than the movie) and long missions, which allow a lot of replay value. The graphics are a bit blurry, but that is to be expected in an N64 FPS.

Overall, I love this game, and would reccomend it to any 007 fan.
