This has to be one of the best Star Wars games ever made. It's on par with Jedi Knight/Dark Forces 2 and Knights of the Old Republic. It's one of the first games to nail the dog fights from the 1st Star Wars films. The controls are great and it's easy to get used to. It shows off planets that are both new and familer from the films like Hoth. If your a Star Wars nut like me, get it!!!
