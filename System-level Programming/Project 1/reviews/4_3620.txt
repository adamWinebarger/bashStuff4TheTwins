You can say this is resident evil with dinosaurs but it's a little more than that. Definitely scary. Puzzles are a little complex and tricky. You'll need a pen and paper to figure them out. Cutscenes are awesome. Monsters are quick here. You no longer have the comfort of running away from a slow moving zombie. Certainly challenging. Four stars overall because this game is short, but still worth it.

I did play Dino Crises 2 and it was okay. More of a shooter. Wished Capcom stayed with the survival horror element. They had a winner here.
