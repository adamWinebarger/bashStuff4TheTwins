Pros:

-Great Graphics
-Great Soundtrack
-Good Controls
-Awesome levels

Cons:

-God awful voice acting
-A difficulty level that's waaaaaaaaayyyy too hard.
-I don't know if it's the ps2 version but sometimes the homing attack mechanic doesn't lock-on properly sometimes.

Overall: It's okay. I bet the gamecube version is better, but if you only have a ps2 then I guess this game is worth it for a sonic fan.
