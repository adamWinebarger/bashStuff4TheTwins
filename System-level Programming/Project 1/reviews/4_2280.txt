When I was a kid, my cousin would never let me play it because it was his "newest game he had", while I had to play with my sega genesis, but once he sold it to me and I got it, I felt in love with the game.

The game it self is very straight forward and very fun. But many things that come up now that I did not see as a kid are evident.

-The game is too easy. The AI's have to lock on you to start doing damage, were by the time they lock on, you could easyly aim for their heads and kill them.
-The graphics looks like a bunch of blocks put together (the character models) which in my personal taste makes the game very hilarious!
-There are many glitches that you notice along the way, but aren't really game breaking
-Even with all these problems, the gameplay is amazing. For a PSone game, this is defenetly a very good game!
