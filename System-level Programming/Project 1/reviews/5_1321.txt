The Crash games for playstion are very fun games,even better than the mario games. Out of the Crash seires I think this one is the best. There are alot of thing you can do and the bosses rock. The story line is the best in this game. It takes plase after Crash2 were Dr. Cortex ship falles down on a temple, wich releses a demon mask. The mask that pertected crash in the first two games stats talking and tells crash that the evil mask is his Brother and his plan to build a time machine to get crystles to
destroy earth. The replay vaule is high and the gamplay is fun, you won't be able to put this game down for awile.
