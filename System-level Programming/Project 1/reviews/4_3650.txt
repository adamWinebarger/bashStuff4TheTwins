The good: great game library, the physical design of the machine is ace, graphics on the machine are generally quite nice, 4 player support, VGA output.
The bad: the controllers (even when brand new in box), it's kind of unreliable (sometimes I have to flip mine upside down with certain discs), it's loud (really loud), library is too small.
