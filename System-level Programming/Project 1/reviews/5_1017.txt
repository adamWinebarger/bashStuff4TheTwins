If you like racing games, Mario Kart 64 is among the best. The game is very simple to control, there's no bulls*** ranking system like in some of the newer games, and is actually a challenge. The game is stupidly fast, and will make you actually feel like you're racing. The game may be a bit dated, but it's fun as hell.
