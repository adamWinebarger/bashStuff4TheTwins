I recently backtracked and played all of the earlier Tomb Raider games. (avoid Angel of Darkness.  Horrible game)  TR2 is about as fun as they come. Graphics are outdated of course, but there is so much to do and to much fun to be had.  The game is long, keeps your interest, has plenty of cool weapons, and a good story.  I'd love to see this game redone with today's technology.  "10 out of 10".

If you're a TR fan and haven't played this, I'd advise that you do.
