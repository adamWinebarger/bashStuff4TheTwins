Well, I'm going to have to agree with Darth Vader on the strong part. But as for the force part, I'm nonchalant. Star Wars Rogue Squadron begins somewhere in between Star Wars Episode IV and Episode VI. Let me just say, you'll be visiting place in the Star Wars universe, and doing missions that have no bearings to the movies, which is good with me. The graphics in the game are some of the best you'll ever see on the N64. The music and the atmosophere of the game are very well done. This is, I would say, the best Star Wars Rogue Squadron game ever made! Oh, and by the way, yes I have played Star Wars Rogue Squadron: Rogue Leader. I fully recommend this game! And thats my review!
