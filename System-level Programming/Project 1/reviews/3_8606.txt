This version of Mortal Kombat was a complete letdown to most fans,because of it's lack of blood and gore. That's not the only bad thing that this port had going for it. The gameplay was just awful! The character movements were very slow and could be very choppy. The Genesis version had SO much better gameplay compared to this. Most of the fatalities were changed to less graphic "finishing bonuses".Alot of the die hard MK fans were really pissed off about that too. Although I DID think that Sub-Zero's and Raiden's "Finishing Bonuses" WERE pretty cool. The two best things that this game has to offer are great graphics and really good sound/music. All the animations are here too. Everything from the floating clouds in the background's sky,to Shang Tsung clapping his hands,after a round is over. All the sounds are also included,that the Genesis version did not have. Overall...this is an okay version,if you can ignore the lack of blood n gore,the censored fatalities and the bad gameplay. If not,then stay with Genesis.
