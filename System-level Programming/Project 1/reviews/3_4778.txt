First I'll explain to you what my superpad looks like, as it's different then the one pictured. It looks very similar to the official Nintendo brand controller, the only difference being that mine has colored face buttons(red,blue,green and yellow), says "superpad controller" at the top and the start and select buttons are a little higher. There is also 2 big bulky circles on the back underneath the directional pad and the face buttons, and it says "interact" below the start and select buttons. There are no signs of this controller being cheaply made at all, and it seems to be about identical in quality to the official Nintendo brand inside and out. However, read on...

Now, for all the 6 or 7 years I've had this controller I never had a problem, but now it's got some major issues! You may be thinking "Jeez, 6 or 7 years with no problem is pretty good!" but considering that the official controllers last forever, that's really not that great. I suppose it makes it far superior to many other 3rd party controllers out there, but it's still not worth it if you can find an official one. Anyway, my controller now has buttons getting set off without them even being pressed! It seems to depend on the game which buttons get set off without being pressed, but needless to say my superpad is pretty much worthless now.

Overall, you could probably do much worse, but the Nintendo brand is proven to last, and if you can find one of those that's definitely the way to go. I'm sure that everyone is going to have a different experience with their superpad - you could end up with one that lasts longer, not as long or one that has problems from the start. This is just my experience with a single superpad controller after all, but official seems to always be the least risky.
