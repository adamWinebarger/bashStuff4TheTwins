Rampage is a classic series no matter what anyone says. But Rampage 2 Universal Tour isn't that much different than the previos Rampage World Tour. Granted yes, there are new boards, new challenges (from both mankind and outer space!) and you do get to use new Mutants but when it all comes down to it, the game gets a little repitive after a while which always makes a game boring.
That and this game was really long, and if you had the Continue option, I couldn't find it and that's another dimension that made this game too difficult for what it was. I won't deny that I had fun while I played but after a while, it seriously goes out of normal rotation.
I loved the fact that you (like the last one) could rampage with 2 of your friends and wreak havok on the world but still, I would make this a renter first before you committed to buy. I'm not saying it's not worth to buy but I am saying that you could easily get tired of this after a weekend or two.
