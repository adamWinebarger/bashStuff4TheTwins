Folks, this is *THE* GTA my generation grew up with not the cheesy 3D versions that exist today. While I do not dismiss the greatness that comes with 3D, the 2D bird's eye view was a great experience at the time and even today. The game was pure fun with little decadence compared to the modern installments.
The PC version is much better though but do not get it from Steam if you own an old PC equipped with a 3Dfx accelerator because the Steam version does not come with 3Dfx support!
