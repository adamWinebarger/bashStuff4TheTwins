This game is definitely a hundred steps past Quake and others of its type. The AI is great. The evolving story is great. The fight against the Special Forces team is nerve wrackingly great. However, all this greatness became  stale, I never bothered to finish the game. The game just seemed to grow  old after a time. Maybe it needs something more to carry the player  through?
