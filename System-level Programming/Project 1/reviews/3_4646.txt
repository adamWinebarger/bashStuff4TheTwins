It look stunning - the artwork is obviously inspired by Chris Foss and Peter Elson (sci-fi artists of the old 'Great Space Battles' books from the  late-70's), and it's gorgeous, even more so than 'Conflict: Freespace'. Not  only is it technically impressive, it has style, too - space itself is a  colourful nebula, and the vehicle designs and paintwork give the impression  that you have a gigantic set of cool toys at your disposal. Surprisingly,  the 'Battlestar: Galactica'-esque story around which the game hangs is a  cut above the average - whilst not exactly 'War and Peace' it's still much  better you might expect.
The flow of play is less interesting, though.  With no terrain as such, it's not so much a tactical game as a strategic  one - the side that can field the most amount of units wins. As one of the  other reviews mentions, a gigantic asteroid field would have helped things  enormously. Furthermore, as in 'Urban Assault', the AI requires that you  manage every significant unit at the same time, something which gets on  your nerves quite quickly. And it gets very, very hard later on -  especially as your status is carried from mission to mission. Often you  realise that you're going to have to start again from scratch in order to  complete later missions, and having to spend ages after you have 'won'  mining for resources in order to build up your forces is very dull.
Do  you want this? It's more or less one of a kind, and it's utterly stylish,  although in the long run both 'Starcraft' and the older 'Total  Annihilation' are more fun to play.
