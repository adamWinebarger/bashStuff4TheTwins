GoldenEye became the steeple for how the Bond series was going to be and I'm glad that it was because for me, I could never get tired of this game because of it's awesome challenges, graphics, gameplay and of course the gore factor (very bloody game. Maybe a no for younger gamers, but for those of us older gamers, a definite).
Level after level, this game played almost to a T like the movie and you got to use all of Bond's weapons from his magnum to a bazooka, to grenades and plastic explosives and of course, the one hit kill Golden Gun.
This also had the perfect multi player vs mode in the history of the 64 system. Where else could you blow up 3 of your friends with a bazooka at the same time (if you were lucky enough to stumble upon them shooting it out with each other).
GoldenEye has never left my 64 rotation and again, I still love to play the multi player when my friends come over. I will again stress to those of us who are parents (like myself) that you should maybe think otherwise if you have some young gamers because it is very violent and very bloody. For those of you without that restriction, go wild and get this game. You won't be disappointed.
