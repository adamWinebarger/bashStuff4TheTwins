After buying my Dreamcast used with alot of games, I just noticed that this is the last game I tried out, and the first game that I put away. The gameplay is the shallowest ever. I didn't play (or look at) this  game since I tried it for the first time. The graphics are extremely bad. The players look very unrealistic. The colors in this game are very bad and dark. the entire game looks like an N64 game.
That's about all I have to say about this NBA 2K1 WANNABE GAME!!!
I hope that this review was helpful to you.
