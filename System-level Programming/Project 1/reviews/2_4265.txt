This thing is very comfortable, for the week or so that it works!  Like some of the other reviewers, and other people I know that own these, the Z button is a BIG problem.  After the week or so that I said it will work, the Z button caves in, and there is no real way to get it out.  I tried taking it apart. and it didn't really help.  The rest of the controller, however, was better than the original.  But many games can't be played (at least to their fullest) without the Z button!  It might be more comfortable and accessible, but it's still a horrible product!  What a joke.  InterAct should be ashamed.  FOR GOD SAKES, BUY THE REAL CONTROLLER!!!
