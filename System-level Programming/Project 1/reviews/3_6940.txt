Tachyon is one of those games that intrigues from the mini-movie intro. The graphics and colour schemes are so dazzling that you will instantly get an adrenaline rush. This has to be one of the best rendered games I have come across. The gameplay is simple enough to grasp, there is not much of a learning curve here. Sound,despite the odd shrill female voiceover, is very well done. So why do I rate a mere three stars? I have one rule to playing games. I play for fun and not to be aggravated. Unfortunately Tachyon has a few elements that are sure to tick some (certainly me) off. The game is played out on the "Job Board" where you will be hired to complete contracts ranging from deliveries to disabling "Capital Ships". Some of these quests require the player to repeat multiple times before figuring out how to find the proverbial chink in the armour. Try disabling a Battle Cruiser that outguns you 20-1. Good Luck. That (repetition) gets boring real quick. Each time one has to return to base, rearm and take off again, usually passing through multiple gates before reaching the target. That is a whole lot of lost gaming time. The thrill of the chase and intensity of combat (assisted by the A1 graphics) makes up for the lag. But my biggest complaint is that I have encountered difficulties with the docking controls. On a few occasions I have had to spend up to an hour just trying to dock (despite the autodock feature) because the AI wouldn't acknowledge that I was there. Indeed I had to abandon one quest (Rescue the Persephone) because the auto dock didn't work. It's not just a thing that makes you go ,HUh! but is also very annoying. The quests simply lack the depth and sophistication (lasting little more than 10 min. on average) to overcome the deficiencies. Don't get me wrong I still think this is a great game, graphically speaking, but the repetition and bugs really spoil the fun.
