This game has some of the best graphics that I've seen for the PSX.  It levels are very colorful and filled with futurous scenery.  The many powerups and weapons add to the fun in this game.  Control is a little hard when you first start playing, but it is easy to get used to (The craft slide a bit when you are turning).  There are only 8 ships to choose from and some of them aren't very good.  More tracks wouldn't hurt either.  This game is a good game and you should buy it.
