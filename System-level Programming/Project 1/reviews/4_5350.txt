I ordered this game a few months ago and my son beat this game in one hour.  This is not the game for you if you are over the age of 5.  The game would just be too easy. If you have a son or daughter under 5 years, they might like it.

The game is about when Tommy loses his puzzle pieces, so with the help of his friends, he has to go get them back.  This game has 12 missions that ranges from getting a cereal box in a store to getting your grandpa's teeth from a goose.  They are really funny, especially in Grandpa's Teeth when Chuckies yells Hellllllllllllllllp! in a Texan accent.

These game's graphics are good for its time.

The sound is very great and very bad at the same time.

Overall this game is real good and I recommend it to anyone who has little kids who like Rugrats.
