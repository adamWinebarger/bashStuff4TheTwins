There is doubt about it, this was the game that showed the dreamcast could be a major competitor.  Being a big fan of the arcade version, I must say(for the billionth time), that this one surapasses the arcade version.  This is a very strategic fighting game,  And it is extremely deep gameplay.  Although my only compaint is that a button masher can beat the computer.  That is my compliant about all 3-d fighting game(as opposed to earlier, Street Fighter2, And Street fighter alpa, series games.), is that button mashing can get you over.  Although, in 3-d fighting games(like Tekken and, of course Soul Calibur), you cant pull off impressive,beautiful,combos with just button mashing.  For the most part, this game has alot of relay value, lots of of unlockable characters. The mssion mode, which adds even more to replay value, and the cool museum mode.  In my opinion, Time attack mode, is useless.  The survival mode, while great, is just too easy.  Another problem, the final Boss, Inferno.  He is pretty easy as well. But this is common in 3-d fighters.  But all in all this is a solid fighting game. It is just a bit too easy.  Even ultra hard mode, can be easily won by a competent Soul Calibur player.(although button mashers can win the first two stages).  This game is a must-have for Dreamcast owners.
