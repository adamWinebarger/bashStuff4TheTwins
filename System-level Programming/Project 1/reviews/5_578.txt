I used to love this because the graphics were great with the best cenery seen in a Ninja game on the PLAYSTATION. The problem is you collect power ups for your shurikuns(throwing stars)that make them pretier and powerfuler, when you die you have to look for more treasure chests as you progress through the game.
I've recently bought NINJA GAIDAN for XBOX and that game reminded me of this with the great cenery and graphics.
