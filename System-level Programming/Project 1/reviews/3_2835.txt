This is the first hand held color system but it has many things wrong with it. The screen is way to small to use, even though the color came out on it they made the graphics worse, U have to be in direct light to see the screen, and the sound is really annoying. Nintindo made the color but they made the screen smaller and the graphics worse. I like the older one better. Like the old one i love the games for it but the sound is not very good and the graphics r bad. It is also big and bulky so it weights a ton and its hard to put in ur pocket. This one could have been beter.
