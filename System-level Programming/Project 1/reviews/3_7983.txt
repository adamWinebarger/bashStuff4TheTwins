Okay...now I'm not a fan of Mega Man, and I have only played this Mega Man, which I recieved as a Christmas present 2 years ago. I recently put this up on a rummage sale for $7 after playing it about 4 times. (In two years!) Well, I just took it off, because i figured out, they are paying mad prices for it on ... so im gonna sell mine there for about $30. Anyways, I played this 4 times....out of the two years I've had it, and my 4th time was the day before the rummage (which was two days ago)...my advice is that if you like cartoons, then this is for you. Nothing but cartoon humor, cartoon mischief, cartoon talking, cartoon bubbles...THE WHOLE GAME IS A CARTOON! I guess if you have liked MM for awhile, MM8 would be good for you, but not for the average gamer. If I had to rate this at an age scale, I would say it is from ages 6-10. My lil step bro likes it, and he begged me to play it and he did, (even though he totally ... as it)...i watched him play it, and it was a cartoon. The only cool part was the TV-like anime at the beginning. I have the Collectors Edition, and there are only 10,000 ever pressed. I collect things, but this, I must say, even though there is a limited number, and they are no longer making this, ...I have to sell it. I won't ever play it, and I wouldnt ever spend the money to put this in a plaque cuz it just isn't worth the money.
So, to wrap it up...If you've liked Mega Man, or you're intrested in the Mega Man legacy...or, for that matter, if you like cartoons, then this is for you...and yes, agreeing with one person that said this earlier...Mega Man sounds like his little sister.
