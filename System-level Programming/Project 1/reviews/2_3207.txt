For years now,gamers have said that this is one of the greatest games ever made. I just don't understand why they think that is. Even for it's time,it was pretty dull and boring in my opinion. I remember dropping 50 bucks on this game when it first came out back in 1997,and being very dissapointed with it. The main problems I have with this game are the graphics(except the cinematics),the gameplay and some other elements. One of the main things that I hated about FF7 is,there is absolutley NO speech in this game at all. You have to read everything that the characters are saying. It gets very iratating VERY fast. All you do is read,read,read...and read some more. The combat system is way beyond confusing. It's all about they hit you,then you hit them,then they hit you with a strong attack and almost or completly kill you. The only good thing I can say about this game,is the cineamatics are beautiful. They are very nice to watch,but the characters and surrounding areas are very blocky looking...Overall,I give FF7 a two.
