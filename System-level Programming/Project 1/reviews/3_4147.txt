Dynamite Cop is a 1-2 player, 3D beat-em-up in the tradition of Final Fight and Streets Of Rage. You choose from one of three characters (plus a couple of secret ones) and pummel your way through room after room of thugs. The graphics and sound are decent, and retain the same feel as Diehard Arcade. The action is quite frantic compared to other games in the same genre, and it is a bit on the short side (it only takes about 15-20 minutes to beat), but Dynamite Cop does offer a few new fun elements.  The ability to use almost anything as a weapon is one of the main draws of the game.  Pistols, grenades, rocket launchers, tables, chairs, and even food can be utilized to dispose of opponents.  Torturing the enemies with grapples and throws is also an extremely fun feature. It could have been longer and more in depth, but if you are looking for a 2 player brawler and some cheap thrills, Dynamite Cop is a decent pick. Especially if you consider that there aren't many quality games of this type around anymore.
