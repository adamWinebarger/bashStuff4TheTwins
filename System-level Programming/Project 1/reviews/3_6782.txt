This game is fun for the whole family with easy learning for the kids and  adults but this game could have been better at the start it is very hard to  get use to but in the end it is very fun but after about a 2 month period  it can get boring if you like simulated games go check out SIM CITY 3000  and THE SIMS they are great games!!!
