It's not that this game is bad, it's just too hard. The levels consist of timed events e.g. flip a switch and run to the other end of the level before a door closes.
The graphics are good as is the music. The story is non-existent though. Something about aliens, and it includes one of the worst and shortest endings in all of Video Game history.
It's fun yet frustrating.
