This is definetly the start of something good. The two later Super Star Wars games were a lot more forgiving than this title, simply because the "Inside the Sandcrawler" stage is extremely difficult, due to difficult enemies and more difficult jumps ( it wouldn't surprise me if Luke's 'double jump' in the later games came after negative feedback here). If you manage to get past the sandcrawler stage, you're in for a very fun game, particularly when you're allowed to choose characters- Luke, Han or Chewie. Perversely, that Sandcrawler stage is the hardest in the game- and it's the 4th level! I recommend this game for the patient, skilled gamer.
