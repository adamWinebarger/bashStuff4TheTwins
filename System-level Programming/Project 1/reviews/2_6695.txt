Trespasser is not a good shooting dinosaur game. It's frustrating and you're wandering around going nowhere with a stick. If you get a stick as a weapon, you know this game is going to be really bad. Second of all, where the heck are all the dinosaurs? I see a dino on the cover, dontcha think there should be some in the game? What else is bad? Well, I don't even want to talk about the graphics. They look like something you could find on an old Super Nintendo game. The camera angles are just plain awful. Most of the time, you're stuck in a wall with your puny stick. Next, the controls stink. You have to press another button while holding another button to walk. You can't walk straight because of the bad camera angles, you end up walking off a cliff. Whoopee. I'm having a lot of fun holding a stick and walking off cliffs. The only thing that stops this horrible game from getting the dreaded 1 is the music CD inside. You can listen to 7 music tracks on your CD player, watch 5 music videos on your computer, and ignore the other crap on the CD. Now, most of the tracks on the CD really do stink. But, the Powerman 5000 video, Propellerheads' Take California, and the Propellerheads video Bang On! keep the track from being just as bad as the game. So, whoever made this game should thank the music CD because it kept it away from being really really really bad. Oh, wait it already is. 2 stars.
