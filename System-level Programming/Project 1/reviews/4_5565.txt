I adore the entire Metal Gear series (except for the first two games in the 80s/1990).  This game is great...awesome story (very believable, too), great cutscenes (terrible graphics, but that's how it was for the time), and ok combat.  I had to take off one star for the following reasons:

1)  The combat.  It's just ok...sometimes the controls stick and it's tough to get up from a crawl and Snake sometimes backs up against walls you didn't mean him to back up onto.  The aiming can take a bit to get used to as well.

2)  You will die....A LOT....the game is not very easy on the "easy" setting either.  The worst part is that you have to go through all the cutscenes again if you die during a boss encounter.  Very, very annoying.

and lastly,

3)  The Psycho Mantis battle is AWFUL, but only if you got this game off PSN on the PS3.  The controller port switching doesn't work at all, and it takes a good half hour or so to kill him.  You'll find the battle to be very frustrating because of this.  I don't understand why this happens, but after performing a search for the issue online, it's clearly well documented.  I don't know why they haven't fixed it.

In any case, the game deserves 5 stars for setting the benchmark for all future games to follow it, but the above concerns are worthy of a 1-star deduction.
