THIS GAME IS SO EASY THAT IT IS BEYOND BELIEF! and I mean that, too.  Some people think that they're the GREATEST nintendo players of all time just because they beat Super Mario on the N64 console.  Big deal.  This game is incredibly, (AND I MEAN INCREDIBLY) Easy.  It's okay, but nowhere as near as good as Zelda.  However, if you want a game that's excellent for the N64, get this game.  Here's my pros and cons for this highly wonerful and yet laughably easy game:
  PROS:
  Wonderful graphics.
  Addictive gameplay.
  Every now and then there's puzzles that are mildly challenging.
  Un-predictableness with the creatures in this game make it fun.
  CONS:
  Awkward camera angles.
  Too easy that you should beat it in about two or one month.
  Controls are weird and at times confusing.
  Graphics are good, but at times there are major glitches.
  This games levels look alike every now and then.
  The plot sucks.  It does.  Save the princess and jump through paintings and destroy Bowser.  Come on!
  Bowser bosses are not difficult at all.  You can beat all three of them in like less than a day if you try hard enough, (I did it in one day, true story, I SWEAR)

  And there you go.  Hopefully this review helped somebody out.
