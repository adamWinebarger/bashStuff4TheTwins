I like this because I have multiple game consoles and a dvd player. This let's you hook up up to three game consoles or dvd players. As long as you buy this from a us store it works. I bought it from china once and only one game console port worked. But I bought this one from NY and all three ports work. I have no complaints now. I currently have 2 game consoles hooked up to it with one dvd player. I have 2 tvs and this let's me play a game and watch tv at the same time so cool. I give this product a thumbs up...
