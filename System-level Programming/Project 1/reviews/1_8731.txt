People say this game is great. To what extent? its great horrendousness? if that is the case, then yes. this game is so hard and cant be beat unless cheated after world 6, the game is impossible. just stick with sonic on sega genesis. the graphics look like the NES, even genesis is better. just don't waste time with a snes console or games.
