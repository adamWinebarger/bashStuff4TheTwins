Not a whole lot to say except that as far as adventure games go, this is  the standard that all others should try to exceed.
Outstanding voice  acting and scripting. Hilarious game without making fun of itself. Tough  but logical puzzles that will have you scratching your head. Beautiful and  ORIGINAL storyline, movie material right here.
This is what adventure  gaming was fated for.
