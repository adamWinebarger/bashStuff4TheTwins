If you need team-based with a blend of Unreal Tourney and the Sci-Fi Channel, here's a good title to work on. It's all multiplayer, so there's no single-player mode (besides the training missions). It's a hard game to explain, but I can say this: this game is fun and heck and lets you take any role, whether it be a repairman, heavy defence, or transport pilot. Buy this if your computer isn't so hot. If you do have a good computer with a GeForce2, get Tribes 2; it adds on to the first in almost every way and is a little more fun than this title. But get either one, Tribes is one of Sierra's best titles.
