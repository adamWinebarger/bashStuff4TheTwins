I really loved playing RE2, but this installation to the series wasn't as good.
I beat the game very quickly, and did not see much need to go back and play again (like the dual storylines and multiple endings RE2  had).
The Nemesis following me around thoughout the entire game was just  plain annoying.  For key plot points, it made perfect sense... but at other  times he just ran around after me while I was trying to explore.
You only  switch characters once, and for a short amount of time.
All in all, I was  not as impressed by this game as I had expected.  I definitely recommend  renting/buying RE2 (it will take you longer to finish, that's for sure),  and then renting RE3 if you are still interested in the series.
