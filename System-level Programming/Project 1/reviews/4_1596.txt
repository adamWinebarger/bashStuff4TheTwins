I had this version in the 90's and played it while a teenager.  I now repurchased it and am playing it in 2008 as a 28 year old.  It is STILL visceral, brooding and epic in its dark atmosphere.  In some ways, the minimalist "3D" of the original DOOM (particularly in this port) lends itself well to the overall gloomy atmosphere.  It creates a certain... menacing bleakness in the landscape.

One thing that REALLY makes this a DOOM to remember is the TOTALLY BENT, EPIC DRONECORE DARK AMBIENT SOUNDTRACK.  Playing DOOM on my modern computer, despite the incredible graphics, just isn't quite the same without that HAUNTING soundtrack.  Seriously, the soundtrack to this particular version of DOOM is so totally harrowing and visceral as to be nearly a moving life experience.  You will never quite forget it after hearing it.  The soundtrack is certainly one of the best of all time (for a video game).  It is profoundly moody, unrelentingly heavy and completely out there.  It sounds like something Steve Roach might create after surviving a journey through Hell and then having Trent Reznor as the music producer.

Overall, this is quite a good port over to the original Playstation.  Original DOOM is an all time classic with brilliant level design and awesome action that set the standard for years.  Pick up this version used and fade away into that crazy soundtrack from another level of existence...
