This video game system is great, and even though it isn't very noticeable right now, it will be a major competitor for the Game Boy Color system, and is very compareable. The two systems are the same size, only the Neo Geo Pocket is horizontal instead of vertical. The system also has a bigger screen with sharper and more colorful graphics. The joystick is a bit hard to use, but you will get used to it. The one major gripe I have with this system is the fact that there aren't really any standout games right now. I do like the fighting games and I have Neo Turf Masters, Sonic Pocket Adventures, and Dark Arms: Beast Buster 1999 which are all good games, but they aren't very noticeable. Still, I'd buy this system and make these games noticeable, because the games and system deserve it.
