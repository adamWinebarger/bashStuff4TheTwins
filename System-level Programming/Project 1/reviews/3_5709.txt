This game is the predecessor to Fear Effect 2 and the upcoming Fear Effect 3: Inferno.
This game and gameplay are very similar to Tomb Raider, Resident Evil and all those action/adventure games where you have to solve puzzles.  This game actually does deserve a mature rating -- with unadulterated gore, some suggestive sexuality and mature discussions of vengeance and under-the-table monies. The graphics is also well-done using a combination of anime and 3-dimensional graphics.  The child's playroom in the Hell level is particularly creepy, and it is very reminiscent of Nightmare on Elm Street.  The voice acting is done well, but Hana has the whole Valley Girl thing going on that becomes very annoying after an hour or so.  Hana was actually much more mature in Fear Effect 2 than in Fear Effect.  The music in this game also wasn't as good as in Fear Effect 2.  The cinematics in this game are great and are nearly as good as Metal Gear Solid (as a date-to-date) comparison.  The only faults of this game that I can see are the long loading times -- before and after deaths.  I liked the Fear Effect series over the Tomb Raider and Resident Evil series because you have to have patience, a whole lot of moxie, some more brainpower, and a whole lot more reflexes.  Overall, buy this game cheap, and you won't regret the purchase.  Otherwise, stick with Fear Effect 2: Retro Helix.
