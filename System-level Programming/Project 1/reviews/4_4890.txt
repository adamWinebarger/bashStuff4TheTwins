Alien VS Predator is the best "Alien" game released to date (I was actually fond of Alien Trilogy) and has a lot going for it. You can play as a marine, alien or predator. Playing as the Alien is the easiest  and is pretty difficult to master as first. You will need to climb on  walls, learn to pounce, and sneak up on your targets. As the Predator, you  will need to use your fast arsenal of weapons, visions and invisibility  features to win. The scariest and most fun character is the marine. You  will need to collect weapons, health and watch your back at all times. You  never know when an Alien is around the corner. And if you see or hear a  face hugger, you better start shooting or run for your life. If one gets  you, you WILL jump from your seat! The only drawbacks is that the save game  feature is lame (if you download the patch, otherwise, there isn't a save  game feature,) and the game will give you extra levels at the end, ONLY if  you beat the game at a higher difficulty. Other than that, if you like the  Alien movies, get this! I give this title a B+.
