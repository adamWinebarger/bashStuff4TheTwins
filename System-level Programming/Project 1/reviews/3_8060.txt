This game is lacking a lot of things, but it is still a good side scroller.  Its definitely reminiscent of Yoshi's Island on SNES.  The story leaves much to be desired, as do the characters, but the overall action is fun.  I reccomend it for younger audiences, but definitely not for the 11 and up crowd.
