If this game was more like the Donkey Kong Country series released on the SNES, then it would be a masterpiece. It's true that it has several of the DKC basics, including several monsters, massive bosses, the Kong Family-Donkey, Diddy, Candy, Funky, Cranky, and Wrinkly, as well as newly introduced members Chunky (Kiddy's brother), Tiny (Dixie's sister), and Lanky (DK's second cousin). However, the game is really more like Banjo-Kazooie, which is unquestionably Nintendo and Rare's trademark N64 series. Rather than having various levels in multiple worlds to trek through in a platform adventure, we get eight massive worlds for heavy exploration. It really just isn't quite the same. As true as it is that it is fun as hell to play, it doesn't get as high an overall rating because it strays so far from the classics. However, other than that, it is highly enjoyable.
