My older brother and I enjoyed the Bubsy series for Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo growing up.  Now that those systems were no longer creating any new titles in favor of the Nintendo 64 and Playstation, it was time to move on to the 64 bit world.  When Bubsy 3D was launched in 1997, we were so excited to try it out, but little do we know that we were being  tricked.  It was a pixelated 3D mess.  My brother got it for his 15th birthday and it was probaly the worst gift he receieved in time.  After trying to figure out this crappy game by enduring the confusing camera rotations, boring music, crappy navigation, and Bubsy's annoying random comments (throughout the game); we just went back to playing the original Bubsy on Sega Genesis.  I may have been the worst friend in the world because I gave Bubsy 3D to my best friend in exchange for Marvel Super Heroes game for Playstation.  This game tarnished the reputation of the lovable, sarcastic Bobcat.  Just stay away from this piece of s*** and go back to your Super NES and Sega titles because they were untouched timeless classics and a whole lot more fun than this 3D garbage.
