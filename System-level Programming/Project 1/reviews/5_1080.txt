When I heard about turok 2 comming out I was so friggin phyced!
I wasn't dissapointed.
It was even bettter than the first.  It was
a little sci fi for me though.  And what was up with turok...
He looked so young.  I really didn't get the story.  If you get the cheats its even better!  Even more awsome weapons for you to
use.  You kick alien ass and take names!
This is one of my favorite sequals for a video game.
Its very original.  The game is frustrating without cheats but
its really fun and cool.  Its pretty much as violent as the
first one.
I love this game!
Great graphics
Great gameplay
Great story....Kina confused with turok bein young
OVER ALLITS A GREAT GAME!
WAY TO GO ACCLAIM!
