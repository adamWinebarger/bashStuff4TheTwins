The blitz series in my opinion is the most action for a sports game yet. I like realistic, franchise, challenging games and war strategy games. But this game in my opinion is the best multiplayer game for Nintendo ever.
GRAPHICS
The graphics are good but not in the realistic way.
How hard is the Game Play?
To put it simply this game play is easy in the way you will win 49-10 every game. The only way it is hard is if you are the worst team and the computer is the best team with hard playing by the computer in options.
Bad mouthing?
Don't get to excited because there is no swearing by players just comments from player to player that are mean after they make a tackle or make a nice catch or something.
Play Editor
In blitz you can make your own plays even choosing if you want the player to fake at the time spin or even go faster. But the plays aren't always as successful as they seem when you make them.
Players
Statistical accuracy is preety much given two ratings which are (....bad) and awesome so stat accuracy isn't that accurate. Each team only has their 10 best players on each team and for the rest of the positions are guards and things which play all the same. So there are only really the main players on the team.
Game length
The length of a normal 2 min. a quarter game is about 15 minutes.
Overtime
In overtime you play for two minutes and the first team to score doesn't win instead it's the person who has the most points at the end of a quarter.
P.S Sorry this wasn't as detailed if you've read my other reviews such as season ticket, madden 2001, Ken Griffey Jr., and Day trader.(Season Ticket is my best one so far)
