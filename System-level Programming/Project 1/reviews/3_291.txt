Don't screw with the card by opening the screws or anything else, the ps2 just can fail indexing the card. There are no hardware issues with it it is just freaking huge. My proof of this is that i can work just fine on the menu with screws opened but  if your game tries to re-index it it can fail. It may seem tedious but just restart the system if it doesn't work at first or unplug and plug it back in. It is so much more card than I could ever dream of using I wish I had just got a 64MB so there wouldn't be index issues.
