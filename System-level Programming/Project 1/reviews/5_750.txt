I first played The Legend of Zelda not long after it was released. Best Christmas gift ever! I do not think there is a single negative thing I could say about this product. It has the classic adventure story: traveling across far out lands to save the princess, all the while discovering yourself along the way. When you are not in dungeons or fighting evil characters, you can do a lot of fun things like explore towns, go horseback riding, archery, hurt chickens and then try  to avoid their gang attack, play your ocarina, go fishing and see how large of a fish you can catch, etc. There is so much variety in this game that it is impossible to get bored. Also, the music in this game is PHENOMENAL. Did you know that there is a Zelda soundtrack you can purchase? There are also some guide books and online walk throughs if you find yourself a little stuck and are in need of some helpful hints.

Price wise, I have found Zelda games for less via Ebay, but you usually have to bid on them. Unless you want to pay several hundred dollars for a "new in box" game, expect the cartridge to look used from being well loved over the years.
