This game is pretty fun when you start out as it doesn't have any of the usual monsters that most on-line RPG's do, also you can customise your character to the utmost extream, eyes, face, smile type, color and type of  clothes, ect... To play the game you have to pay $9.99 a month. The  graphics are very good, especially the enviroments, and actually  contradictly to other people I thought the graphics on the characters were  pretty good. Anyways this game has a lotta strong points over other on-line  RPG's, for one, YOU CAN ACTUALLY BUY ARMOR AND WEAPONS FROM SHOPS AT A  REASONABLE PRICE! Something that EQ (everquest) failed to do as it was  Impossible to buy the 3000 plat bracers or whatever it was, and you ended  up having to buy everything from players. What I didn't like about Asherons  Call was that there was no music. The monsters wore thin, and became  dislikable. Also,like on  UO (ultima online), you have to have certain  spell components to cast spells, I really hate that. All in All the whole  reason I quit Asheron's call was not because it wasn't fun, but because I  didn't wanna pay 9.99 a month for that little bit of fun.
