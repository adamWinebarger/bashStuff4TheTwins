The "fun" rating here means the overall emotional effect of the game. There are some pretty genius and breakthrough things in this game i.e. the radio and the flashlight, the atmospheric effects achieved with the fog and darkness and switching between the real world and the altered world. One of the most impressive effects is where you are running from monsters in the dark with your weak flashlight while the shadow of what's chasing you can barely be seen behind. They did a h-ll of a job with the creepy level design and sound effects, very scary, but it's also a negative just because looking at rust colored bloody rooms and listening to hums and whistles is unpleasant. I also found the circle motif used in boss fights to be pretty genius. Some issues: The pace is stalled right from the start with a tedious key finding quest, this could take hours if you search manually, I got frustrated after 30 minutes and looked at an online walkthrough. That really becomes a problem with the game, all the locked doors and barely being able to see where you are going, it isn't fun. This was my first vague impression of the flawed game play, it's really a lot like Fester's Quest for the NES: it's gray, empty, you navigate repetitive looking areas, and swarms of hopping things are out to kill you. The story in outline is good, and has a clear goal that keeps things moving forward, basically "save Cheryl", but the scipt ranges from adequate, to boring, down to mst3k type badness like something from "The Touch of Satan". The camera can be a problem, and it's easy to get spun around and moving in the wrong direction when everything looks too similar. The puzzles on the last level feel too contrived, "there's a key but I can't reach it because a piece of glass is in the way", why not shoot the glass?
