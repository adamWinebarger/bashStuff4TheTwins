Don't let the title confuse you, Mortal Kombat Gold is essentially Mortal Kombat 4 with a couple of subtle new features. The main difference between Mortal Kombat Gold and the previous Mortal Kombat games is that it's done with 3D polygonal graphics. The gameplay remains relatively the same, except now each character has their own weapon which can be drawn.  The only other major difference is that Midway decided to exclude the button tap combos from this version.  You have the ability to perform basic button tap combos, but they are short (only about 3-5 hits) and have little variation between each character. Most of the old Mortal Kombat favorites are back in some form or another...Lui Kang, Sub Zero, Scorpion, Cyrax, Katana, ect., plus several new characters as well. Fatalities have also returned and as one might expect, and they are as gruesome as ever presented in the 3rd dimension. The only real fault in Mortal Kombat Gold is the same one that has plagued the series from the beginning...the shallow gameplay compared to other fighting games, and the horribly [bad] AI in the one player mode. Even with the shiny new 3D graphics and weapons, Mortal Kombat 4/Gold is still at it's heart just Mortal Kombat 3.  If you have become tired of the same old Mortal Kombat formula over the years, you can pass up Mortal Kombat Gold and not miss much.  If you still love Mortal Kombat and are looking for a new way to play and rip your opponents to shreds, by all means this is your game.
