I remember when this game came out and  the PSX(sony) had a iron clad deal with Square for their new FF. I remember when I overheard these kids talking about "the graphics are going to be great" and I thought ,"Yeah but what about the story line and battle systems etc"? but all that went out the window since game manufactures started catering to  not the die hard rpg, dungeon crawler, shadow  gate, FF1  on the NES fan... but to the people who didn't know anything about games except " they have good graphics" It all started with this game.

The of course Tifa was all the range because her extra large "pixles" and all I heard was young boys every where talking about that and it was sad .  the story itself was a departure from the traditional FF series and this is a more post apocalyptic and dark. I myself did not like the graphics because the characters look silly to me all blocky and the backgrounds while interesting  I had a hard time seeing where I was supposed to , or could go. So therefore I had to spend a lot of time checking all areas .

This game to me saddens me and makes me thing of the turning point in games, when game companies started marketing not to kids but to adults and that made me sad.
