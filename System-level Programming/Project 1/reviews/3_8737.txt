Well this is a very old game, that was released for the PSone system. It was re-released, on another console. As one of the first games in the series, it did a good job. It is nearly impossible to find in any store now. Used or new.

Gameplay: This game is a lot like Tales of Phantasia. It's a linear battle system with small sprites running around, attacking with swords or magic. There is not just one mage or sword wielder in this game. The style is that of all the other games, just earlier. If that makes any sense.

Graphics: Not bad for an old PS game, it was awesome in its' time. Now though, it would not go very far, as it has pixels, and not awe-inspiring graphics.

Characters: The characters were cute. Not as good as later Tales game characters. These characters could not talk, but they had talking swords, which was pretty cool.

Storyline: Basically, like all RPG and all Tales series games. Save the world scenario. Which, for some odd enough reason, never seems to grow old. The characters each have their own story and backgrounds, so it is cool to look into them. If you want to purchase this game, I would suggest to buy the remake if at all possible.
