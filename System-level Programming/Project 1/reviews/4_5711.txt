Fear Effect is a fun game that is challenging and quite good value for just $10.  The game is sometimes very tricky though.  Some puzzles go beyond hard as the game progresses.  The bosses and enemies are already hard in the first levels.  The game goes by pretty quick even with the challenge though.  Buy this game if you want a good animated action game that will leave you wanting to play Fear Effect 2.
