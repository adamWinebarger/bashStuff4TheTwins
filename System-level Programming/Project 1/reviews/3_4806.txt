I remember getting this game a while back when I was younger.  The game was difficult to master, which I attributed to my young age, but I loved to play it because of the nice atmosphere it gave; beautiful, fantasy surrounding, pleasant music, pretty landscape (the 3D terrain had an enhancing effect over other strategy RPGs I had played on the PC before).  Overall, I enjoyed the game a lot.

Moving back to the present day, I had lost my copy and was itching to play it again, having all but forgotten what the game was like.  My girlfriend and I had gotten hooked on Age of Wonders, and I wanted to investigate similar games for her.

I ordered LoM SE on Amazon not too long after.  After installing and playing the game for a bit, I was a little dissapointed.  I was still the game that I remember, but it seemed deficient in ways I hadn't noticed before.

For example, the graphics did not age well.  I can go back and play much older games from my childhood such as Quest for Glory I & II (SCI engine) and still marvel at how beautiful the graphics are despite only 16 available colors and a screen resolution of 320x240.  This is double edged, because while I feel that LoM has pretty graphics, they still seem to work out poorly in the long run.

Secondly, I still find the gameplay to be difficult.  I'm not a kid anymore, and I have since mastered other fantasy RPGs, but the system in LoM seems a bit awkward and difficult to master.  I couldn't play it for more than a half hour.

Overall, I think it's a good game.  Even though it's not my cup of tea anymore, I can see that lots of other people really love it, so if you like the genre then I give it a good recommendation.  The price tag is very cheap, and it's well worth a grab.
