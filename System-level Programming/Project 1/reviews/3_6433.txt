Square only seemed to spend time on graphics and FMV.  They didn't seem to take the time to review the storyline much, because after the first two discs, everything tends to get rather dull and boring.
First of all, I really wasn't fond of the battle system all that much...I didn't like the idea of the enemies leveling up with you.  I guess Square did this to make the game go quicker, but that just made things dull.
Second of all, the junction system wasn't a bad idea, but the idea of relying on the GFs and Squall's Renzokuken doesn't really appeal to me or any other gamers.
Third of all, it just seemed too rushed.  They didn't spend the proper amount of time on this game as Square did in number seven and number nine.  It just seemed like everything was assembled in only a series of two months.
Well, I don't wand this to seem negative, so I'll just jump to the positive points.  First off, the graphics.  Everything looks crisp, clean and very attractive to the human eye.
Second of all, the music.  Nobuo Uematsu is a VERY talented composer, he comes up with some amazing musical scores that is well on its way to blow you off of your chair.  However, it seems that he was rushed on some of the pieces, and it didn't look like he had enough time to finish some of them.
Third of all, the storyline IS a good storyline, but the game just seemed far too linear, and extended over a long period of time.  When you first play it, you can't get away from it.  But after you complete it, you may not want to start a new game right away.  And the second time, you may not play it as often as you did the first time.
So, in conclusion, it was a rather inconsistent game.  It had its ups and downs, but all in all, it's not a bad game.
