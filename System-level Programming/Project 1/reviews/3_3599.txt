This game is pretty bad, and I don't mean that in the good way. The graphics are horrible(but when it came out it was considered okay graphics) and the story line is just rediculous. But this game brings back some memoried of me and my brother when we were younger, and I enjoy just having this game around the house just to remember those days.
