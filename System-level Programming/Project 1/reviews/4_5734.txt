Of all the war games me and my sons have played.  This was by far the one of the most fun, I loved how the enemy soldiers were programmed to respond to noises and attacks, very realistic. No matter how many times we played a level trying to get off, it never got dull because the enemies didn,t respond always the same. It was very fun making mistakes,like accidentally throwing grenades at my partner or setting explosives to close and for getting to tell my partner. The only disapointment was not enough levels, but for the price this game was well worth it.
