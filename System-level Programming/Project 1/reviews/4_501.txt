Well here I am. Making a review of a game made in the mid 90s in this year, 2011. What can i say? This bring backs amazing memories.

I could remember the time i went to the arcade with a friend, I found this game and i just HAD to play it. The graphics were weak in the arcade, but then they had it on ps1, which the graphics are much better.  I won't say this is the best game i ever played, but hey, it's not fair comparing a 90s game to a current. SO let's just put it this way because I'm bored.

Graphics: 4.5
Sounds: 4.8
Controlls: 5.0
Replay Value: 4.8
length: 3.5
Overall: 4.5

I'll recommend this to anyone who's enjoying classic games or is a street fighter fan,,, or to anyone who likes fighting games.
