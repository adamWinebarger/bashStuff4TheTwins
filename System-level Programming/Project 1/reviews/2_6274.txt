as you might have heard, this game was downright terrible. the only thing that kept me going was the story. in my personal opinion, the story is very exceptional and the many months of work they put into it paid off. before starting, i would like to comment that i was very excited to get this game after the two-in-a-row masterpieces final fantasy 6 and 7, and for the fact that it was created by squaresoft, but i was extremely disappointed after about one hour of gameplay. now onto the review...
STORY: 9/10
as you have most likely heard, people say that this storyline is based on the theme of love, when in many people's opinion (my own included), this game is anything BUT love. the only thing close to love that happens is **SPOILER**rinoa and squall kiss at the ending**END SPOILER**
which really isn't all that loveable in my opinion.
similar to final fantasy VII, the setting is in the future (irritating downside, as insanely advanced technology is not that fantasy-like), but this is a mediocre downside of the game
The story goes pretty much like this: an evil sorceress is on the verge of enslavement of the world and a resistance to defeat this woman called Garden trains military soldiers called SeeDs to battle against her and her troops. pretty lame sounding, as seed and garden are really actually one of those ideas that a first grader could come up with in about 5 minutes, but the story actually picks up at about disk three (yes it is pretty slow).
SOUND AND MUSIC 6.5/10
the sound is really quite good in this game. squall's sword slashes when hitting a target, quistis's whip cracks when snapping at a target, and Zell's mighty fists make smacking noises when hitting a target.
such as final fantasy VII, the music in here is not that well conceived and memorable such as the earlier final fantasys. the boss music is sort of catchy (once again such as final fantasy VII), but the rest of the music is rather annoying.
GAMEPLAY 2/10
the single thing that totally MAULS this game is the gameplay. the battling is terribly tedious, and the magic system is completely raped of its glory. instead of learning magic abilities, now you waste time "drawing" magic from enemies. another terrible mistake squaresoft made while making this game.
a new addition to the gameplay is the Guardian Forces (GF) which are pretty much summons just in a stupid term. these guardian forces are pretty much the only thing that will keep you alive in this game, as you need them to enhance health, strength, and so on, which i will get to in a moment. the guardian forces are the main attack force, and with these forces there is barely any need for the "attack" command (other than Zell's Duel limit break). The animations for guardian forces are well animated, but EXTREMELY long and tedious.
Limit breaks are the only other useful thing in this game, but unfortunately, they can only be accessed when you are in life-threatening situation, completely aboliting the well-conceived limit break bar.
MENUS AND PUT-TOGETHERS 1/10
this is terribly time-consuming and irritating. the menu is where i spent most of my time on this game. gladly, squaresoft got rid of the horrid materia system and added on the god-how-could-this-get-any-worse junction system. this system takes about a half of an hour just to understand, and then you spend even more precious hours of your life drawing magic upgrading it so a boss cannot kill you in just one blow. for example, you have to spend about an hour drawing 100 lifes from an enemy just so you can raise your health a couple thousand points.
then after this boring proccess you must draw 100 Tornados in order to raise your attack power (I am almost completely CERTAIN this process is required to defeat the final boss)
The second complete worst part of this game is the following: THERE IS NO LONGER AN EQUIP OPTION! what happened to equipping weapons and armor? there is a way to upgrade your weapon, but that consumes serious time and involves ridiculous side-quests that are extremely boring. don't even bother going through the stress of completing these quests
a ridiculous thing they did in this game is that the characters level up with you, so you can finish the game at level 8 or so (as leveling up is not necessary and bosses give you NO experience points{I completed it at level 7 or 8})
GRAPHICS 9.5/10
The best part of the game, the graphics. The FMV scenes are superior to every other graphics i have EVER seen in my entire life-span (yes including ps2 graphics), and even during gameplay the graphics are superior (during gameplay they are worse than ps2 graphics i might add), and the only flaw in them is the pixelations, as the characters look a bit fuzzy. but that problem is solved in FFIX.
You remember the disgustingly distorted characters in FFVII? well, thank god, they are replaced with actual human-like figures that look like HUMANS at last. no more stubby oversized arms and legs with huge heads that remind me of cartoons.
there is only one thing i love about this game, and it is the ending. as i said before, the story is VERY good and is the only reason that i gave it 2 stars instead of 1. the ending is EXTREMELY good (not as good as FFVI's though) and made me feel good.
REPLAY VALUE: 0/10
as many other people have done, as soon as i finished wasting my time playing this game and finally destroyed the final boss i took out the disk from my playstation, placed it in its case, placed in on a shelf behind my other cds, and it has not been touched ever since. this game was terrible, and i wish i had my 30 hours of gameplay back. i say instead of even thinking of buying this game, look for final fantasy anthology and final fantasy 6 instead.
