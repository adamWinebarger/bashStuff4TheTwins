We might just be cursed, but it seems every N64 we buy, we have problems with it. This is our third one, and it takes about a minute to get a game working (multiple games do this, so it's not the game, and yes, we are putting the cartridge in correctly). Still, it's understandably getting old, so this can be accepted. The games are worth the wait. I recommend Banjo-Kazooie and Banjo-Tooie, very great 3-d platformers and multiplayer (on Tooie). Hands down best two games ever, they are a huge part of my love for video games ever since I first played them about 10 years ago. But yeah, great system.
