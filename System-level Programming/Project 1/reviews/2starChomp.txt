 especially   quiet atmosphere   try finding   walk  guards.   comes   're watching  movie instead  playing  video , ,     , 're "playing"  movie.    people  create  atmosphere   .   job Konami.

Sometimes  guards aren'  intelligent  '     (  actually walk   elevator    walk  ,  noticing )  apparently none       're standing   couple feet ,   ,    actually pretty nice   allows gamers  finish Metal Gear Solid   major difficulty .     imagine  hard      guards  extremely observant   .

Honestly, Metal Gear Solid focuses   storyline  actual gameplay.

STORY: 9/10
     heard, people    storyline  based   theme  love,    people' opinion ( own included),      love.    close  love  happens  **SPOILER**rinoa  squall kiss   ** SPOILER**
  isn'   loveable   opinion.
similar  final fantasy VII,  setting    future (irritating downside,  insanely advanced technology    fantasy-),     mediocre downside   
 story goes pretty   :  evil sorceress    verge  enslavement   world   resistance  defeat  woman called Garden trains military soldiers called SeeDs  battle     troops. pretty lame sounding,  seed  garden   actually    ideas    grader       5 minutes,   story actually picks    disk  (yes   pretty slow).
SOUND  MUSIC 6.5/10
 sound       . squall' sword slashes  hitting  target, quistis' whip cracks  snapping   target,  Zell' mighty fists  smacking noises  hitting  target.
  final fantasy VII,  music       conceived  memorable    earlier final fantasys.  boss music  sort  catchy (    final fantasy VII),   rest   music   annoying.
GAMEPLAY 2/10
 single   totally MAULS     gameplay.  battling  terribly tedious,   magic system  completely raped   glory. instead  learning magic abilities,   waste  "drawing" magic  enemies.  terrible mistake squaresoft     .

Limit breaks     useful    ,  unfortunately,     accessed     life-threatening situation, completely aboliting  -conceived limit break bar.

Unfortunately,    subtle         vastly inferior   previously  mentioned titles,  cause       slow   frustrating.
   tactical level:
#1.  Extremely   fights:     weapons     frustratingly innacurate   don'   damage.    result, fights             . . ,    idea.   -Com  Shadow Watch, fire fights  tend   relatively quick  decisive.    bad guy steps   front     cover,  goes .     ,   stand    front     range     spaces           kill .   shoot  miss,  shoot  miss    .      finally  hit  guy,  takes five  six  shots    .  mouse hand   sore       clicking.   accuracy   lethality    weapons        doubled  trippled,   lead  shorter,   decisive engagements. 2.  Computer controlled    huge  advantage  accuracy:     weird glitch    obvious      fight onwards.   computer controlled units   roughly    times  accurate   (supposedly elite) mercenary  units.     mean?  couple  examples: .)      mercenaries (   accuracy rating)  lying   ground, firing    opponent lying   ground,   intervening cover.   computer  controlled   hit    times     hit  . .    unit   carfully positioned  crouching    tree  cover, shooting   computer unit standing   .    hit       frequency.

   Strategic  Level:
Unbalance Economy:  Simply ,  amount  money running      doesn' balance    cost   items.  Local  Militia,  example,   trained  $750,  sum    comparison     mines      doesn'  enter    strategic thinking.  Similarly,  rewards  completing quests      ludicrously  wnen compared   income.         major NPC   trying       major quest  offering   20K dollars.  "Hello,        single day   mining.     bother?".      lot   stuff     adjusted. 2.   preponderence  innefectual hand guns:     reason,    mercs    afford   start      equipped  hand guns rahter  assault rifles.
