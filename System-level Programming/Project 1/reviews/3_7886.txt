I love playing Monopoly and can destroy anyone who challenges me. But what do I do when [others] are too scared to play me? I play this. I wasn't sure if this would be good or bad and was suprised it was not that bad. Still, it is a bit easy but when yur board this will take up some time. I prefer playing the real version but this game is pleasant.
