After Final Fantasy VII, this was a significant disappointment.  The graphics were ok, but the character movements were very jerky, which defeated the attempyt at making them look more lifelike than those of VII.  The junction system is an interesting attempt to make magic different, but  it was rather complicated.  I'd say that replay value is very little and  the battle system was nothing exciting.  It's a decent game with some nice  new ideas, but disappointing.
