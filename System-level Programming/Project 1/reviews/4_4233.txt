Star Wars fans should be grateful for this game.
This is a 100% strategy game, and even in the galactic battles you need to double think which spaceship to send against which.
The idea of the game is simple... "manage your economic resources wisely as well as your politics and military to gain supremacy over the other side".
You'll need to select destinations for your mines, refineries, development labs, training facilities, etc so as to maximize output and grab the most out of them...
One thing you have to take into account is how changing the game is... in some part you can be lured to assume you'll wipe out your opponent in a couple of turns when you angrily realize he has taken control of 3 or 4 of your planets leaving you with most of your spaceyard or building facilities out!!!
Get enough patience because the game is long and pretty hard to understand, but once the effort's been made it's really worth it!
