Oh wow....I remember playing this colossal flaming pile of turd. A friend of mine rented this game from Blockbuster for a couple of days. And I wished we both could have taken back the time we wasted.

They had great ideas for this game: You take Sub Zero from the Mortal Kombat series, use this opportunity to tell people more about his back story and his battle against monks, set it in cool locales and incorporate MK inspired game play and controls in an action adventure, side scroller with light RPG influences. What could possibly go wrong??? How about....EVERYTHING in this game.

First off, Sub Zero walks and controls like a robot. Second, this game uses every button on the controller (you even have a separate button to hit when you want him to face the direction to walk!) Third, you unlock his special moves as you progress through the game and while many use the same directional pad + button combinations in Mortal Kombat, they are 100 times harder to pull off. The bosses are petty damn hard so expect to die a lot. The graphics and sound do their job in setting the mood for the game, while the music is standard MK and kung fu inspired theatrical sounding. The PS1 version features full motion cut-scenes between the stages you fight in while the N64 gets the standard static artwork.

I give it two stars for the cool music and graphics for its time. But that alone will not make a great game. You may be tempted to pick this up if you love Mortal Kombat and the price is right. DON"T DO IT!! This is an example of how Midway had great ideas for this game but executed these great ideas very poorly.
