This game is truly a great game and a classic. This game gives endless entertainment and great graphics. Although it's very addicting,it never wears out. Offering many fun and awesome worlds and many heavy and huge  weapons. This game does not have extreme gore, you can change the settings  and it is not that bad in the first place. This is a masterpiece. I love  it. I think this is one of the best first-person shooters i've ever played.
