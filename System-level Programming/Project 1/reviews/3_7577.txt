........ Well, this game is okay if you're an RPG beginner of have to do this weekend and drank too much caffeine on Saturday Night. Very, very short game. Also very easy, if you're somewhat experienced in RPGs. It was much easier than I expected. Well, anyway, if you've got a couple extra bucks and nothing to do, maybe you'll wanna pick this up.
