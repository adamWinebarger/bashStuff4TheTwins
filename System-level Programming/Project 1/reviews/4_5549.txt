Ok I remember playing this game a long time ago and LOVING it. But after installing the latest patches and giving it another go I have to wonder...WHO decided to make the enemies be able to shoot you from so far away?
  Whoever did that and made that decision...ruined the game. I am going to uninstall the patch and play again and see if it changes things because I swear it wasn't like that when I played it the first time around. I will update after trying it sans patch.

UPDATE: the problem wasn't the patch, it was my memory. My apologies to any this review affected (prolly like 10 people lol). This is a great classic game and I hope you try it.
