This is not a five-star game, and it's far worse than Super Mario 64.  The camera tracking and hint system are both badly programmed.  But its major flaw is the overall game design.  Rare came up with a truckload of games and ideas, and then just put arbitrary decisions into the overall game to string them together.  There are tons of things to do, but if you don't beat the level bosses, you can't progress.  Rare should have designed all the mini games and boss levels so that choosing another Kong character, or returning later on with more experience, would make the game easier.  They failed.  The hours you put into this game *let* you go further, but don't *help* you go further.
There's a lot to like, and after a few hours climbing the learning curve you'll have twenty-plus hours of fun wandering around.  But completing the game is an exercise in frustration, even with a game FAQ at hand.
