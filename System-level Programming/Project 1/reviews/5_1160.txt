I remember when my parents bought this game for my older brother in the 90's. It brings back so many memories and my brother and I still play it even though we beat it many times. My brother would play it every day trying to beat every obstacle and this game is truly fun, when my brother let me play the game I was hooked, I did need some of his help on many things but that didn't bother me from having fun. I enjoyed this game and anybody will. I usually don't like these kind of games but this game is amazing and I love to play it. Nintendo 64 truly does bring back memories and their games are fun too.
