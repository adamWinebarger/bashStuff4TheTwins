What a disgrace to Marvel. Neither Spidey nor the X-Men come out of this with integrity left. It's seriously one of the worst games I have ever played on the Genesis. Terrible graphics, worse gameplay and awful music. Don't be like me and assume that it must be good because Spidey is involved. I guess I should have researched it first coz it seriously is a bad, bad game.  It is sort of a cross between a side-scrolling beat-em-up and a run-and-gun game, but succeeds at neither.

It really just feels like any other generic platformer that was reskinned as a Marvel game halfway through development as very little of the gameplay feels unique to the characters. Why is Spidey jumping up ledges to climb buildings? Why is he not wall-crawling? There is some crawling, but it feels like an afterthought. The character sprites are small and puny with little weight to the animation or impact to the action, and the level design is haphazard, repetitive and generic. Sometimes you'll even have difficulty identifying exactly what the environment is supposed to be. As for the music, well...it's not memorable. It's just noise, honestly.

Stay away!
