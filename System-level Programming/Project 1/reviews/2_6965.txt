It seems that most of the people who played this game liked it.  And I must say that when I got it, I was expecting a better experience than I got, something along the lines of Rainbow Six with more running and shooting.  However, as opposed to most of the reviews I saw, Delta Force was a huge dissapointment.  With horrible graphics (Maybe it's my computer, but they didn't even have a strafing animation or realistic grass) and stupid extras as weapons (see the pathetic explosion from a strike) the game was a massive waste of money.  I'm beginning to think that everone likes it because it's so cheap.
