I will admit it i reserved the nintendo 64 months in advance. Sure when i got it i thought it was great, but after months of defending it against my classmates and their playstations, i decided to get my own. It by far surpasssed the n64's enjoyment. Sure the n64 has better graphics, but playstation was the better games and better sound. In my opinion nintendo aims their games for a much younger audience. Many of their games are not apealing to the 14+ crowd. Playstation provides way more games for this age group, along with games for the younger group, but they can still be injoyable for the older gamers. The playstaion controler is much better in design. The dual shock controller is the best that i have seen, but who wants to put that bulky heavy rumble pack in the back of the n64 controller? I hate the memory pack for n64, one season on qb club fills the whole thing, theres 20 bucks gone for a game that costs 60 in the first place. That brings me to another point, games are alot cheaper pn playstation, you are looking at a 20 dollar diference. If you are deciding between a playstation or a n64 i would go with the playstation. If you are buying a system for a younger gamer then i would consider the n64.
