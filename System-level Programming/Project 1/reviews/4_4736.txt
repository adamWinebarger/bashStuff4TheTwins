This game is great, and it is a great game overall in order for LucasArts to strike back at Eidos's Tomb Raider for trying to take away Indy's title of the greatest adventure dude out there.  The game is one of the best I  have played, but if you do the wrong thing, the game crashes.  MOST of  these problems can be fixed by downloading patches at lucasarts.com, but I  really hate the hassle this causes.  Make sure you know how to get a patch  if you get this game.
