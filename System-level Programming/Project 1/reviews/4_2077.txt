This game kept me dreaming as a child back in the late 90's. I used to crave Resident evil 2 and its "So realistic graphics" (Hey, Back then, Ps 1 Was Awesome Graphics.) Its Scary, Its Frightening, And its Impossible to beat with just a knife. Give it a shot, Only downside is poor Voice acting, Like their captain obvious or something. But if you Played RE 3 this will seem like a Downer game. RE directors cut is where its at!
