When Nintendo 64 is compared to PS1, which is actually cheaper than this is, there is one weakness that Nintendo 64 has. And that is the lack of games. Also, N64 runs on cartridges, and many of its games are costly. Since the console is old, you can get many of the items for this console, and the console itself, for a fairly low price. Nintendo 64 was actually a big hit when it came out, I remember so many of the kids going nuts over it. I actually never had one when I was young, but I don't think I really missed out on much. If you are thinking of getting this gaming console as a gift to a little one, then you should try to get it for a low price. My Mom bought one for[dollar amount]for my brother on Christmas, but I got one used for [less]. Even though it is old, there are many great games, especially multiplayer games available on N64.
Pros:
1) Large selection of multiplayer games
2) Great RPGs, such as Zelda: Ocarina of Time.
3) Fairly cheap if you shop around
4) Pretty good graphics
Cons:
1) Lack of games
2) Old, so lack of new releases
3) Runs games on cartridges compared to small CDs.
There are many games which younger children will love available on N64, so it makes a great gift for young ones.
