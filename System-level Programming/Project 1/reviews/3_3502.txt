What to say... Code veronica sure looks nice but does it play well? In my  opinion it does not. The story is boring and a bit over done. Am I not the  only one who is sick of blasting away at zombies? It's just getting old.  For those who love the resident evil series, you will love this game. For  anyone else looking for something fresh look elsewere.
