Definately not the best simulation game put out, but still, this offers some addictive gameplay, until you reach "tower" status.  There  are different levels and your job is to build a sucessful mall complex,  with shops, movie theatres, rec halls, condos, business offices and more.  With rare VIP visits, bomb threats and Santa Claus this game doesn't have  tooo many unexpected twists. You have to do a lot of waiting to get to new  levels and to earn more money.  I'd say if you like sim games give this one  a shot if you find it at a cheap price.
