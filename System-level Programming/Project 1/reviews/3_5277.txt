These recently arrived at my door. Eager to pop them in, I dove right in. The buttons are excellent, they do not stick and they work great. The cord is long. The D-pad isn't the most comfortable one I've used (Dragon Force was fine, but a twitcher like Tomb Raider started to get me sore), but it's an acceptable replacement. Maybe it will get less-stiff with use, but this'll work in a pinch.
