Street Fighter Alpha 3 is the best Street Fighter experience one can have on the original Playstation. With well over 20 characters selectable from the outset, classic Street Fighter gameplay, and multiple gameplay modes, this is one fighting game worthy of adding to any gamer's library.  There are a few faults though. Some animation problems are present here and there (some characters have newly animated moves that don't quite fit with their old set of animation frames), the endings could have had more attention paid to them, and some of the music is rather bland.  Also, for those of you who may not know, the Alpha series is supposed to take place between the events of the original Street Fighter and Street Fighter 2.  So why are we seeing characters appear that are from the later versions of Street Fighter 2, such as Deejay, Fei Long, T. Hawk and Cammy?  Even though Capcom may need to work on the story a bit, it's still nice to see all of the Street Fighters together in one game, so I'm not complaining. Even though there have been countless versions of Street Fighter before it, Street Fighter Alpha 3 proves that you can't beat a classic formula, and that the series is still very enjoyable. Unless you're completely burnt out on 2D fighting games, I recommend picking up Street Fighter Alpha 3 for either Playstation or Dreamcast.
