WHAT IS THIS?!
No but seriously.  They used the cdrom tech really good and made the ambiance wonderful.  But it seems this was just made to show off the cd technology.  It doesn't really need to be *easier*  We just need more of a story line and a direction of what to do.  But it sold very well and spawned some sequals (Riven being the best of the series).
This is for the most devout of adventure gamers who don't mind staring at the screen and saying to themeseves: "What the heck is this?"  "Why am I playing this?"  "Gah!  What am I supposed to do?!?!"
Buy then and only then.
