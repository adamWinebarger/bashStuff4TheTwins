As I've said in other reviews of this series, the first one is the best.  It wasn't needlessly difficult, and the puzzles made sense.
I just played through the first few areas of the last revelation, and to my  disgust eidos has not fixed the problems that first appeared in tomb raider  two and became rampant in tomb raider three.
puzzles are okay, PUZZLES IN  WHICH YOU CANNOT FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU NEED TO DO, OR CANNOT FIND OBSCURE  ITEMS BECAUSE YOUR BRIGHTNESS IS TOO LOW, OR THE ITEMS AREN'T LOGICALLY  CONNECTED TO THE PROBLEM AT HAND ARE NOT OKAY.
the series still looks  great, but frustrating backtracks and endless wandering looking for the  hidden button have consistently robbed this series of the splendor we saw  in the first incarnation.  Remember just wandering through the lost valley  or jumping into the waterfall over and over again?  If that level was  redesigned under the current standards, you would have to endlessly reload  the game because the waterfall kills you and you have to hit a button on  the way down which you don't know is there and can't see so that a door  half a mile away opens up.  And there's no reason to think a button a will  even open the door.
I refuse to play a game with a hint guide on my lap.  Guns and ammo are way too hard to find otherwise.  I gave this game one  more shot at recapturing my interest in the series.  I guess I'm done with  Lara, which is a shame because I've really loved the series.
