' .

 , whats    difficulty modes? 're    choices; Hard  Easy.    screwed . ?

EASY MODE:
-   starts  (Jill)    assault rifle  3 .Aid sprays.
- Enemies    easy  shrug .
- Jill     6 bites   zombie     "Fine" condition.
-   infinite ink ribbons.
-    weapons      unlocked  located   storage crate.
-   massive amounts  ammo   gun    storage crate. ( ' talking MASSIVE)  example: 250 Handgun rounds, 76 Shotgun shells,  2 100% AR clips.
- Picking  ammo, Gun powder,  health items  pointless                .
-       challenge.

Needless  ,  quickly changed  Easy  Hard mode    10 minutes  playing.  usually don'  playing Hard mode   .   didn' leave     choice,    RE veteran  figured   handle .   words, Easy mode  obviously designed  newbies  people  absolutely SUCK.

HARD MODE:
-  start    ammo  .
- Jill takes   damage     attacks.
-   "dodging" feature  nearly impossible  .
- Nemesis    strong   kill      hits.
- Jill' inventory   . Unlike   Resident Evil.
- Zombies respawn   enter  exit  . (True, considering  situation  environment   sense.   impossible  kill  zombie   city.)

Nonetheless  completed    Hard.  died 3  4 times  annihilated  Nemesis.   question ...  wasn'   "Normal"  "Original" mode  ?     challenged  enjoy      . Playing  Hard  difficult  irritating. Especially     8 ft. monster   tail    .

Secondly,  story.

STORY:
 sum     story   Jill desperately trying  escape Raccoon city alive.       story actually takes    day   events  Resident Evil 2.  main conflict   story   Umbrella corp.  secretly dispatched  mutant tyrant called "Nemesis"  Raccoon city  seek   destroy   remaining .... . Namely Jill  Brad Vickers.  won' spoil         RE fans   happens anyway.

  didn'    story      confusing. ,   Nemesis??     ??  mean seriously whats  origin? ,  RE2 Leon  Claire  looking  Chris,    discovered  traveled  Europe.   telling   Jill    city   ?     Leon  Claire cross paths  ?  ...

   doesn'  sense (  mind    RE2)   Jill makes     ... building     half   doors  boarded /barricaded   access.   contradict RE2' plot altogether.   Leon  Claire    building?  doesn'   sense.  didn'       doors Jill didn'     locked?  story   pretty clustered.  '     story,     -story.        rushed     lot      .

Thirdly,  Nemesis.

NEMESIS:
Despite    earlier..    Nemesis    addition   .  definitely adds   suspense        '   pop   surprise . ,  doesn'     tired  frustrated  . Mainly     lot     city     explore  couldn'     pursued  Nemesis!!!      15 minutes apart   appearance. , exploring   'll    sooner  .  yes   fend  .  '     ' nearly impossible  kill,    wasting precious ammo  health trying  fight .    ,     remember .   RE2...  '   similarity   .   huge mutant zombies  stalk  throughout  .    obvious  Nemesis   variation  . .

Pros:
RE3  improve  add    features.  ...   "dodge" feature   adds   gameplay  helps  ton    combat.   Capcom 3   finally add  180 degree spin;  enables     quickly  run  avoid danger.   liked   "Gun powder" mixing feature,  enables   create ammunition   weapons.    lot  action  surprises   . Adding  interactive environmental objects (explosive barrels, etc.)   nice feature   helped  difficult situations.      outdoor environment   .      nice break-     .  finally,  don'   press  action button       flight  stairs.

Cons:
 graphics      RE  RE2   slight improvement    models  design.  pre-rendered environments don' look    dark   RE2    nice.      short compared    ,    playable   Jill.  camera angles   annoying sometimes, especially     enemy blocking  view. (        .)  wasn'  scary, exciting,  suspenseful  RE  RE2.    moments    jump    seat.  lastly,  lacks  story.

Conclusion:
Bottom line, RE3:Nemesis    . ' fun, scary,  entertaining.      ,    opinion   weakest    series.    disagrees, obviously hasn' played   .    cut   slack  Resident evil 3   lot  live  .     Resident Evil 2  set   standard   series.   , Resident Evil 2   legendary ,   possibly   sequel   video   history.     RE3      sequel.   isn'     predecessor.
