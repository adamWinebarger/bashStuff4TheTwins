After passing the second and then the first, I was attempted to do this one. The graphics are much better than the previous two, but the story got very boring. The adventures, too, became very uninteresting. Regarding saving and hidden place this one is by far the simplest.
The story here continues from where it ended in the last part, if you have won, that is. As oppose to aku-aku, we see the evil uka-uka who is the Big boss of Dr Cortex. And we see that Crash is forced to fight them! Why? Why, to save the world, of course!
In the previous 2 parts we had gems. Now, this was not enough for the overactive designers. They introduce trophies in this new part. For a trophy, you have to finish a level within an allotted time. This is not that difficult, but you cannot achieve it in every levels. Some levels are extremely difficult to finish fast. I picked all the gems and all but on trophy, and imagine my frustration.
If you are a crash fan you might like this one, but you cannot help being disappointed.
