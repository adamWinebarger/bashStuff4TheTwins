I remember playing this game a few times with my friend. And then I asked him why did he get it....over and over. Batman Forever is based on the so so movie of the same name and as licensed games go, developers rush it out the door as soon as possible to make money. So that's one of the many reasons why this game wasn't so great.

As some of the other reviewers have stated, this game used digitized graphics and controls made popular by Mortal Kombat at the time. So, it looks great for a SNES game and uses the Batman license. Unfortunately, everything else about the game sucked. Batman and Robin both move around like either tanks or robots. Basic things like walking and jumping are a chore to do. They each have special moves, which are set up like moves you perform in fighting games, except they rarely work. The enemies were super hard to beat and it seems every couple of minutes you see a loading screen (you should NEVER wait for a game to load if it's on a cartridge!) Add in the lack of save features or continues and you got a hard game that wasn't meant to be played or beaten.

Stay away from this crap even if you are tempted to buy it. It isn't worth it and it turned out to be WORSE than the bad movie it was based on.
