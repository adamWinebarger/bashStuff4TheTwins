I bought this game when I first got my PS1 because I loved playing my cousin's Crash Bandicoot 2 game. While this game is fun, the part I hate about it is you have no control over when you can save the game. You are given the option at odd points in the game, and even if you beat 3 levels after the level you saved at, if you start over, you'll start at the level you saved at, and not the one you most recently beat.
...I recommend getting this game because it IS fun...
