Nice speed and gameplay overall.  The only 2 cons are the camera angles and some of the enviroments aren't fully interactive.  You can't enter all the buildings with each character.  Even with that though it's a great game and some levels are extremely well matched with the background music "red hot mountain". I played this game for nearly three hours before realizing how long I'd been on it.  Deffinetly worth the time and money to pick this one up.
