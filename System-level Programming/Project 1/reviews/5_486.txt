Though this review may be 14 years 2 late,n my opinion TK2 is the best of the PS1 Tekken games. From the cool fmv intro 2 the ending credits TK2 is by far the best looking/sounding 3D fighting game on the ps1 console. TK3 backgrounds,music,fmv cinemas,light source shading,animations/combos just doesn't measure 2 the standards set by this 1996 classic and it was release 2 years later,go figure!
