If you want a game that you can master in 5 mins with any character then POWER STONE IS IT. I beat the game as I got it once I discovered "the formula"...
I'll list the pros and cons to give you a fair rundown
Pros
1) Characters are unique and fun with personality, i.e. personal story, ending etc (missing from PS2)
2) Backrounds are the BOSS and fully interactive
3) The moves and effects are radical (King Capcom shines here)
4) Fast action
5) Cool Japanese voices
Cons
1) One dimensional fighting sucks as a 3D fighting game!!
2) Weapons make no sense once you know the formula! They just slow you down and make you a prime target for the formula!!
Overall
Overall this is a DISAPPOINTING attempt at a fighting game. The concept is good but the fighting engine is flawed. Powerstone 2 got it right and is a blast, read my review!
