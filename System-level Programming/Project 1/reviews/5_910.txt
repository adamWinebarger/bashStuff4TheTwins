Goldeneye 007 on the now obsolete Ninetndo 64 is still to this day my favourite game of all time. Before the Nintendo 64 arrived i was a massive Sega fan, nothing anyone said could put me off my Sega obsession. And then i played Mario 64 and everything changed. I went out and swapped my Sega Saturn and all it's games for a brand new Nintendo 64 and a second hand copy of Mario 64 and i never looked back. Then allmost a year later Goldeneye 007 arrived and introduced me to a whole new genre. You see before Goldeneye, i had never played a first person shooter so it was all new to me. I also happened to be a huge James Bond fan at the time so i was quite excited about playing this for the first time, and i was not dissapointed. Everything about this game just worked so well, it had the right feel a bond game should have. It was also one of the most addictive multi-player games ever. Me and me mates would spend hours playing this game. The weapons are some of the best ever in a first person shotter. The snipper riffle in particular was awsome to use and the tank levels were so much fun. Since Goldeneye there been some trully amazing shooters including the brilliant Half-Life, but for some reason i have yet to play a game that has that same magic as Rare's wonderful game. If you haven't played this yet then you don't know what you're missing.
