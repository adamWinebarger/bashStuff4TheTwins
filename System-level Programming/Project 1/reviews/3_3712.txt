Nemesis is one scary mess!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

So beware!!

He seems to be around every corner imaginable, and he's quite invincible, until the end, so don't get those hopes up! :-)

A decent run-through, but a bit difficult.

Difficulty: 7
Difficulty, compared the hardest Resident Evil (RE Remake): 6
Graphics: 6.5
Characters: 6
Sound: 6.5
Replay-ability: 6 (You get more guns, I believe as well as other hidden bonuses).

3.5 stars.
