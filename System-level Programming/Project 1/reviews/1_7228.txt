Would have a good review if the developers spent more than five minutes slapping this together.  By the second or third time through the questions were already repeating themselves - awful!  Plus multiplayer is just a "fastest-finger" question to determine who plays solo.  Big deal!
The worst part is the game only runs about two or three times before it crashes on startup.  This is on an Intel PC with name-brand components, no cheap swap-meet stuff.  The only solution has been to uninstall and reinstall the game.  A visit to the Disney Interactive site for tech support... umm where is it?  Because of this I can't recommend anyone purchase this game.
They've come out with a second edition of this game (wow, so quick?)  Perhaps this version works?
