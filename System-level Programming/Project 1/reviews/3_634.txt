In 1998 Twisted Metal 3 was released for PS1 the sequel to 1996's Twisted Metal 2 and the original Twisted Metal released in 1995. A new developer 989 Studios took over for SingleTrac who developed the first games in the series. This game uses a entirely new engine built from the ground up since it was a new developer working with the series. I have personally played this game and will say that its garbage and not even worth being mentioned as apart of TM series. The cars control bad plus the graphics look realistic like the first game rather than cartoonish like the second game. Its basically the same as TM2 where you travel around the world to places like Tokyo, London, Area 51, Egypt, Hollywood, just to name a few levels. A few characters from the previous games are in the game like Darkside, Hammerhead, Sweet Tooth, Thumper, Outlaw, Mr, Grim, Specter, Warthog, Minion, as well as new characters. The endings for the characters are really cheesy unlike TM2 which was pretty dark. The game also allows you to hook up a multi-tap to play with four other friends well three but four if you include yourself.
