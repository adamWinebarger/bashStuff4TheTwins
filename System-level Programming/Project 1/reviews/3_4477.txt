Just because I only gave the game 3 stars doesn't mean this is a bad game, on the contrary, I LOVE this game, the only problem is with age of empires 2 and age of mythology out, I find it hard to go back and get the original, but it definatly is a fun rts and extremly user friendly at that (not overwheelming like some rts's start out) recommened for beginner rts fans but I'd buy the second one or age of mythology before this game.  If you get this game, do yourself the favor of getting the gold edition with everything together.
