WWE WM 2000 is a great game with tons of matches..
When I first got this It was around the time it first came out.
Man this game is awesome.  They steel cage match, Hardcore match, and I can't remember but I think they had first blood?...I think...I don't remember.
The graphics were good for it's time.  Gameplay was quick which is a good thing.  It is also the first N64 game to have blood in a WWE game.
My favorite match is the steel cage.  It's sooo fun but I wish they had a Hell in The Cell match.
gameplay 5/5
matches 4/5
graphics..for its time..5/5
4.5 out of 5
Later...
