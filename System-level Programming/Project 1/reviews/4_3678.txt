I got this mainly to play Resident Evil CV, Carrier and a few other games so didn't use it as much as my other consoles. To be honest it just didn't have many games I was interested in. The console itself was heavy. When held it felt like a solid well designed piece of hardware. It has four controller ports for multiplayer which is a plus. I thought it was a competent game console though did have an issue with the controller. It seemed poorly designed or at least for the games I was playing. Other than that I thought it was a decent console.
