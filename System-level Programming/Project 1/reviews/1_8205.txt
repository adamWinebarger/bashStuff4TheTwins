As the other reviews have stated, this is a very boring game. You are Batman or Robin set out to save Gotham from the Riddler and Twoface. An interesting thing to this game is that the buttons are set up like Mortal Kombat, high punch, low punch, up to jump and select to use your grappling hook. When you start each level you make a choice of two extra weapons like smoke bombs, gas guns and baterangs. There's not much to the game, you move straight through on a set side scrolling platform path beating up bad guys. The graphics are pretty amazing, being that the game is so much like Mortal Kombat, so are the graphics!
