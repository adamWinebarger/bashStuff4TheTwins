I like sports games and find many of them are good value for money. But I have found many of the nfl games to be hard to play. If you didn't know  much about the plays etc then it made it even harder. But not as much with  nfl 2k, sure it helps if you know abit about the plays, but there is a  feature where the dc can select a play for you. A good way to get started.  The graphics are brilliant, but still has some problems every now and  again. The ref is at times poorly done and forget about the sideline  graphics. But the stadiums and players are amazing. The few problems the  game does have i am sure will be worked out in nfl 2k1. But overall this  game is a ton of fun with a lot of playability.
