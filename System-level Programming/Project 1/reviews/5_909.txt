Another Rareware CLASSIC!  The game that defines 1st person shooter!! Like the title says, Rare did it Best.  I love the PC shooters like Doom, Quake & Duke Nukem.  But 007 did it 1000%!  The first of it's kind...perfect 3-d graphics & 360 control.  And the first game to do stealth right.  You can sneak through levels stealth with your silenced pistol, or go all out nuts with the AK.  This model of game would go on to influence ALL future fps.  PS3 & xbox fanboys take notice!  If rare hadn't come up with this formula, Modern Warfare & Halo wouldn't exist as they are!
