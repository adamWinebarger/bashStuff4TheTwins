...the actual game is okay but certainkly isn't on par with goldeneye. with the exception of the man dan carrington the characters are wooden and the story is very poor, you never feel into the game's story at all. the level design in general is bad, like the supposed 'stealth' mission in chicago where every enemy knows where you are anyway so there is no stealth involved whatsoever. some of the levels though are fun with inspired design like the sniping levcel in the snow but it doesnt make the game good.
what does make the game worth playing is the multi player modes, although the graphics take another turn for the worse they are acceptable in 2 player but with 4 you cant see anything at all without a massive tv. the multi modes make pd, beating the hell out of simulants in slow motion can be fun and sure beats the game. this is what you should be buying the game for, not for the story mode. the trouble with this is that the pd arenas are poor and its only the graphically altered goldeneye levels that are worth playing. a bit lazy on the developers part.
overall: except for the inclusion of mr. carrington the story mode is a bust so unless you have enough mates to make the multi worthwhile don't buy it.
