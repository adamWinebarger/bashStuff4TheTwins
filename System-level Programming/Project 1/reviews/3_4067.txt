This is a really good game. Great graphics, good game play, and chalnging levels all are some of D3's major features. However, the graphics are so good that you need more then 64mg ram to play. my 333mg, 160 ram can run slow, and im not even on the higher graphics setting. Also the levels are way to hard. It sounds pathetic, but im stuck on level 2. Dont buy this game unless you are a interplay fantic.
