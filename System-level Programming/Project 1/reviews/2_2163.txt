If you are new to Mario party games, check out number 2 or 3. This is fun to begin with but when you keep playing the same mini-games it gets a little boring. We rented this and and liked the concept but didn't enjoy it much but when Mario Party 2 came out and it stated it had more mini-games we bought that one and we really enjoyed it. We can't wait to get the 3rd one. No matter what game you go with expect to play for atleast an hour.
