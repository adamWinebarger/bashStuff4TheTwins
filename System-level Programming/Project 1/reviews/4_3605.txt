There are usually too many football video games that try to bring more special graphics displays, then the actual enjoyment of humor and feel of a actual enjoyable sports video game in the entire field of video games. The only acception, NFL Blitz, is a perfect exception to the rule, blending in some zany humor, and some incredible things you'd never expect to see in any real football game.
NFL Blitz 2000, the successful sequel to NFL Blitz, contains all of the componens of each team in the AFC and NFC. Also added to the mix are incredible zany stadiums that consist of playing football on a rooftop in the middle of a city, to the classic style of an traditional stadium. Also included are humorous codes that can change the game into a war zone. Codes like No Interceptions, changing the football into the size of an giant balloon, and even super field goals, can change the face of football time and time again. It is just too bad that can't happen in the real game, it would finally make sports fun.
While many people are now into the games for Nintendo's Gamecube, for those who still own the Nintendo 64, really need to own this sports game. It is just a first down to the ultimate gaming library. Only, if you still own the Nintendo 64 and didn't trade it in for a CD-ROM gaming system that takes longer to upload the game. NFL Blitz 2000 is that one kind of fantasy sports game, that continues to bring in the touchdowns easily.
