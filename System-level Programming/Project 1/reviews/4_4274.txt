Your gary or james or both and you are off to kill Goldman the one responsible for the 1998 curian case or House of the Dead 1. You will face an endless number of zombies and kill several bosses. Your goal is to stop goldman from destroying all of mankind with his secret weapon which is the final boss of the game. The game is fun for a while but eventually gets very boring. You can play arcade mode or play original. The game bases all on the arcade. You can do training mode which has several shooting events you can do until you get 5 stars on them. All different things are in this game and what ive explained is not all of it.
