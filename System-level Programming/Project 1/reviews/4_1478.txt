I'm not very good at video games, so this game is pretty tough for me.  I only have about 20 stars right now and I've had it about a year!  However, other than the not-so-great 3D graphics and the silly camera angles, it is a fun though challanging game.  I look forward to someday getting all 120 starts!!!  haha
