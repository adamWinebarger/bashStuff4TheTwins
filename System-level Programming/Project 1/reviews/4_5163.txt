There's no other way to put it, there has been no other game I've ever played in my life where I've wanted to play the game from the beginning over and over as I did with Castlevania:SOTN. Sure, I beat it countless times, but from beginning to end is just so much fun it's unbelieveable. The game is SUPER DEEP, you'll never use EVERY special trick no matter how long and how many times you play this game. The graphics are spectacular for 2D, the music is the best of any game I've ever played (why no soundtrack available??)
So why not 5 stars? It hurts me to not give it 5 stars but I have to be honest, the games kinda easy, sure it's super long, but back in the day of the old castlevania games, they were just so challenging in terms of obstacles and amount of enemies. But with this game, with all the save spots, free extra health and lack of extremely hard obstacles it's kinda hard to die. Although, if it had been that hard then I probably wouldnt be playing it over and over again. Let's say 4.5 stars.
One more thing, if you go through the entire castle and beat Belmont, don't think you're done yet, you've still got a whole other castle to conquer.
