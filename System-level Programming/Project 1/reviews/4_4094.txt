Mechwarrior 3 is the sequel to the classic mechwarrior 2 which made me stay up almost every night. Now, I must say the graphics are beautiful. The lighting effects are shown well on my Creative Labs Savage4. Gameplay is  pretty impressive too, I use a gravis blackhawk. For keyboard users, you do  get a fold-out leaflet with all the keys, pretty intimidating at first. The  biggest problem with this game is its length and difficulty. The missions  finish way to fast and are way too easy. I beat most of the missions on the  first try. I also finished the game in less than a week. But you  multiplaying on any of those networks. I'll probably buy the expansion (I  hope its good). There arn't many new mechs too, so another disappointment  there. All in all, this is a good game, but to fully get its value, you  have to play against other people.
