Usually I'm an adventure game fanatic at heart, but this game was bought for me as a gift and I found myself greatly caught up on it as soon as I installed it on my computer.
The game is very much a dungeon bash situation.  You create a character and assign them attributes, buy them weapons, and then go out to the local dungeon and pound every monster you meet, bather up as much treasure as you can, and then buy better weapons so you can kill even more monsters.
While you're in town the villagers will tell you about items that have been stolen that you can find and return for rewards, or people who ask for your help in killing a particularly nasty monster, or they tell you a bit about the big creature you'll find yourself facing at the end of the game.  Your ultimate goal will be to gather several crystals together to gain an item that will allow you to take on the evil dragon lord at the end of the game, but there's dozens of other quests to keep you occupied meanwhile.
One of the most innovative features to the game is that it maps each area and dungeon differently for every new game you start, plus it juggles the quests around so that no one game is exactly like another.  It was an interesting detail that wasn't necessary, but was nice of the programmers to add.
All in all, I was quite pleased with this game.  There's times when one gets bored with confusing puzzle games and you just want to run around in a dungeon and hack up monsters.  Darkstone offers adventure by the bucketload, and will hold your attention for awhile.
