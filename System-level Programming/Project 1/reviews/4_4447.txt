I have played this game for 1.5 years now. Its great and addictive and is very different from what I have played before. It draws you in as the scenarios get tougher and your will to beat them skyrockets. The gameplay is good, but can lag, and the time in the game moves slow. I feel its a good game to play if your bored and you should buy it and try it yourself. Beware, its addictive.
