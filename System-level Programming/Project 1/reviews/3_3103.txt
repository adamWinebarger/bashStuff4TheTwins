I first saw this game on Retsupurae, and was intrigued by its hammy dialogue and weird fighting style. After buying it (and it arrived in great condition), I found it to be enjoyable, but nothing special. Really the only things that keeps me coming back to it are the characters and voice acting. Each character is an anime stereotype, and the voices range from over-the-top (like Paul Eiding's Gally and John St. John's Dazaiver), to melodramatic (like Lie and Ihadulca's voice actors), to exactly what you would expect from a low-budget anime (like Chris Cox's Keiya). The gameplay only uses two buttons for fighting, attack and block with your distance from the opponent wand what directional button you press changing your attack, which seems stupid at first, but turns out to be a style that's easy to learn but difficult to master. There's a decent amount of replay value, like filling up the encyclopedia by beating each character's story and unlocking alternate costumes and announcer voices by beating the arcade mode. However, I can't recommend this to anyone other than gamers who are looking for something really obscure to play.
