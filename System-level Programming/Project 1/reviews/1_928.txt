Unless you intend to cheat and mod the game don't waste your money. Uneven gameplay,and few options plague this game,it is also way too short even at this reduced price. Spend your money on a game,just not this one. Hope this helps,I hate to have games collecting dust,but this is one of those and I own about 50 recent games so I know what's what.
