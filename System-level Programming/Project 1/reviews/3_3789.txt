The VMU has some cute features like mini games and it can be your watch so you know what time it is. It has other cool features. But i don't reccomend it because all it holds is 200 blocks of memory. Get the 4 slot 200 block each slot memory cards. It worked great for me. I just forgot what brand it was made by so youll have to look for it closely if you want it. The VMU is just kinda a waste of money. ONLY GET ONE OF EM DONT EVEN THINK OF GETTING 2!
