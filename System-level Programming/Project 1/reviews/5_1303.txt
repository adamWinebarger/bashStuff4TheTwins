I would say this is one of the the best ps1 games ever. I play it on my ps3.
It is fun from riding a tiger to running around spinning bad guys. This is child friendly but also adults love it.
It has good graphics, good gameplay, good ideas and lots of levels and replay value. Get this you won't miss out.
