I had to use a Gameshark to get the extra levels on this game.  It's tough.  It shows you just how hard it would be to be a secret agent.

There are two features about this game that I really like.  The first is what I'd like to call maim-ability.  If you shoot someone in the leg, they'll hold onto their leg, same with the arm, the head, and even the groin.  Before this game, the most you could hope for was that characters would bleed when they were shot and fall down when they'd die.

Still maim-ability doesn't mean that when you shoot them in the leg they won't be able to run again.  They'll limp for a few seconds and then be as good as new, except take a lot less shots to kill.

Some of the tougher characters take a lot of hits before they're even to the point of getting to maim-ability.  You have to shoot the boss of the game 10 times in the head before he even shows signs of weakening.

The second thing I like about this game is the spy feel of it.  You go on missions, and you work with gadgets (although some are indeed lame).  But the cool thing is, on some missions, you've got to be really quiet and sneaky.  You sneak down halls and pick off unsuspecting guards one by one with well-aimed shots.  Of course, if you get bored of that, you can always make a lot of noise, have a bunch of guards come after you, and blow everyone away.

This game is pretty realistic.  There may be better games now, but during its time, this game was cutting-edge stuff.  It's worth remembering, even though it was hard as heck.  I usually just like playing the easy levels and maiming bad guys quietly.
