Gory, fun, and entertaining!  Yes, House of the Dead 2 is all that and then some!
The graphics in this game are simply amazing; a perfect resemblance to that of the arcade game.  The animations and textures are used wonderfully.  Gameplay is pretty darn solid, and the replay value is tremendously good, especially if played multiplayer.
Don't listen to those who find this game too "difficult" due to the lack of gun.  All you require is a controller, some skill, and quick reflexes.
I highly recommend this game to all Dreamcasters!
