The graphics are dated and the story's mediocre. The game is still good. Let's face it, people. There will never be a perfect RPG, but this one is good. You've all heard the story, yet here's what's great about it. Really good side quests, beliveable charecters, and beatiful movies. What's bad is the plot, the graphics, and the last boss. That's it. Goodbye.
