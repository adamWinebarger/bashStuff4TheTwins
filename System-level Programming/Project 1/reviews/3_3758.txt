One of the coolest things Dreamcast offered was the VMU. After all, it was a Gameboy like memory card that fit into the controller perfectly and gave it a little screen. Yeah, wow, a screen. I still don't see how the screen is useful. In Sonic Adventure it displays a freaky little Chao pretty much the whole time. In Crazy Taxi it just had an animation loop. So the ugly useless screen is out for me until I find a game that uses it. Then the buttons. WHAT ARE THE BUTTONS FOR? It goes IN the controller and the buttons are COVERED UP. When I take it out it just sits like a brick and does not display anything. So why the cute little D-pad and tiny little A/B? As a memory card it functions well and is conveniently placed. Yet after five games I ran out of memory. FIVE GAMES! My Gamecube memory card has close to 20 games on it and is only half full. Even my junky third party PS2 memory card holds more. I could hardly fit a Chao onto it. So, while this is the official memory card, you might be better off with a third party model.
