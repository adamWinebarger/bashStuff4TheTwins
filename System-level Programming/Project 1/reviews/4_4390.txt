This is a very good game. I used to play this game for hours on end. It's a lot of fun. The best part about it is that you don't need to have a supercomputer to play it. For those of you who's computers can't handle RCT 3, buy this game. Do Not get RCT 2, it's not worth the money to buy a slightly worse carbon copy of a great game.
