I PURCHASED IT FOR MY HUSBAND BECAUSE THE ONE HE HAS WAS DAMAGED IN A FLOOD AT OUR HOME. HE KEPT HIS IN ALMOST NEW CONDITION, ALWAYS WRAPPED UP. I PURCHASED THIS ONE HOPING TO CHEER HIM UP ABOUT LOSING HIS. IT TOOK WEEKS TO GET HERE. IT WASNT SHIPPED UNTIL 1 WEEK AFTER I INQUIRED WHERE IT WAS. IT WAS A LOD DIRTIER THAN DESCRIBED. HE SPENT ABOUT 1 HR CLEANING IT. HE WAS HAPPY TO GET IT, I WAS DISAPPOINTED IN THE SHIPPING AND CONDITION.
