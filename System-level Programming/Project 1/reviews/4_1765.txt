Namco Volume 3 is a well rounded collection of classic arcade favorites. It features Ms. Pacman, DigDug, Galaxian (which became addictive very fast after a few plays.), also..features Pole Position II, Phozen (which I had never heard of till this collection. It's not for everyone.), and last but not least we have..The Tower of Druaga. Obviously the best games are Ms. Pacman, Galaxian, and DigDug which each of these games are worth having individually, so having them all on one disc it's hard to go wrong. But wait there is one slight problem. When you go to the screen that allows you to change the dip switches..when they pop up they cover the menu and you don't know what your changing until you get back to the game, only to realize you have unknowingly changed your amount of lives to 1 and set your bonus on 10000000 or something to that effect. Maybe it's just me but I would have preferred a modern menu instead of the switches. Never~the~less 4 STARS.
