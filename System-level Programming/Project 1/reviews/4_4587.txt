The third in the mystery-solving series, GKIII not only improves on the series but on the genre itself!
For those who enjoy games that involve more thinking and amazing storylines, this game is definate buy. It was the first Gabriel Knight game I had ever played, and when I was finished I wanted more. The plot alone is so deep and enriching that you'll want to play just to see what happens next.
My only problem involved the difficulty of some of the puzzles. It's not that they were too hard, but that they seemed a little ridiculous. Some seemed to beg for the purchase of a walkthrough, and I admit I did some "walkthrough" searches on the net, but it was worth it to see the ending.
I thought the graphics were great, especially the detailed scenery which is an almost exact duplicate of the real French town of Rennes-Les-Chateau. One of the high points in the game was Robert Holmes soundtrack, which relied mostly on creepy, atmospheric piano pieces. It really added to the experiance.
Anyone who enjoys puzzle-based suspense games should give this one a try... ... it's more than worth it.
