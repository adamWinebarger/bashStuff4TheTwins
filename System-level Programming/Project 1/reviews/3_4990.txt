I'm sure that this add-on was pressured by the public to be released  quickly due to the great succsess of Baldur's Gate, but at the time of  release the price tag seemed a bit high for so little substance. Other than  some new areas and quests to complete, the only redeeming quality of this  package was the experience cap being rasied a tad giving all those  dual-class humans a chance to shine.  As a nice bonus, there are some  REALLY cool new magical items that could ease the time an Import character  will have in the next installment.
