Before I bought this game, I downloaded the demo off theinternet and was completely freaked out.  I rushed out and purchasedthe game and was completely freaked out by the money I wasted.  Do you love impossible control options, very high system requirements and load times that have you kicking your computer?  Then you will love Nocturne! This game had all the perfect elements to become a great game, but it fell short on delivery.  However, if you love the Resident Evil genre, then this game is for you, but I warned you.  END
