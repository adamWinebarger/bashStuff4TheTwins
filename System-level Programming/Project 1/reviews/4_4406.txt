I have to say that even a long time after it's release, this game still keeps me entertained. The graphics are great, the atmosphere is amazing, the AI is incredible! Altogether one excellent game. There are loads of different puzzles, and there isn't any faffing around with end of level bosses.
There are few downpoints though, even in a game of this standard. The direct x graphics mode is terrible, and the open GL is not compatible with my card, even though open GL works fine with my card in other games. More general pitfalls are that it takes time to get going - there's no way to skip the intro which isn't that relevant to what's going on anyway. The first few levels provide little entertainment. 3/4 of the way through, you get thrown into some alien planet, which almost stops the game dead. It sometimes feels a bit linear as well.
However, enough moans coz the good outwieghs the bad by a long shot. This contains all the elements that SiN should've had.
