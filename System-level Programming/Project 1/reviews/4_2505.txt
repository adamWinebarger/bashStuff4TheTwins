I love the three person tag teams, the trios run togeather, but you can tag the next leader by pushing circle. Every character on each team has their own special moves, but the teams are all pretty well balanced, they all have a fast hero, a strong hero, and a hero that can fly.
The grapics are great, fast and great! It has a great third person view, the camera is behind and above the team, you can move to either side, you can jump up, you can fall down, it's just a great 3D game!
It's soo easy and plays smoth, my only complaint is it that it is too fast in some places, like in the giant loops I easily lose track of the Sonic, with him moveing from side to side he will run off a cliff and I won't notice it until he is dead
