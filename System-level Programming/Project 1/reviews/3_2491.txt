I was excited to get this game.  It's apparently a sequel to "Sonic Adventure 2: Battle" (though, I hardly see how), which I loved, but it wasn't as fun as I expected.  There are four teams with different stories and varying difficulties, but each team plays through the same levels in the same order.  The areas have a decent variety, but when you play through each four times, it gets boring.  There were sometimes changes to the levels, but not much.
In terms of gameplay, each team has three characters, and you can switch between which one you control.  One is a speed character, one is for flying, and one is better at attacking.  This is kind of fun, and it is mainly what makes the game unique.
I also think the game could be too hard.  I don't mind a challenge, but the game could be too ridiculous at times.  It wasn't even fun many times because of this.  Once you practice a lot, it's not so bad, but it took a lot of practice to get good enough that the game finally became somewhat fun.  I believe there was a final story after the four main ones, which would have been nice to reach, but I couldn't get all the Chaos Emeralds, so I couldn't.  So try to get them as you go along, or you must redo levels.  Not much happened in the part of the story I actually got so see, and it could have been interesting, but I don't know.
So I really wouldn't suggest buying the game unless you really want to and really like Sonic games.  It's not terrible.  It can be fun, and the gameplay is unique, but repeating levels and the difficulty is what disappoints me about it.
