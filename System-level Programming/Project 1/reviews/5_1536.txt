Greetings, I am Oklonia. My review of Super Mario 64 is right here.
Super Mario 64 is a game that all master N64 gamers have to own!
I don't even need to tell the story. What's happened? The same traditional story: Bowser kidnaps Princess Toadstool,
Mario finds the princess, rescues her, and destroys Bowser.
Capcise.
The courses and star's names are quite creative. (e.g. Lil' Penguin Lost) They are more riddles though.
The graphics are so sharp looking and realistic, that maybe just a few could go on GameCube. (GCN)
Despite a few annoying sounds and no multiplayer mode, Super Mario 64 is really super!
This has been Oklonia.
