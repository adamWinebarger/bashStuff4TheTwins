I went in to Syphon Filter with high hopes and was somewhat dissapointed.  While the levels are large and fairly well designed, the quite average graphics caused problems when you get close to surfaces.  The games controls also suffer from problems, mostly in terms of the targeting function, which is useful for quick aiming in tight spaces, or when an enemy is moving fast, yet will often aim for enemies you can't hit, when you are being shot at by ones you can, or even aim behind you, throwing the camera into wild spinning and throwing your character out of control.  Fortunately auto-aiming removes the necessity of using targeting in most circumstances.  In some places, infinately respawning enemies will cause a great deal of frustration (just to be fair, I did set off an alarm, but still...).  Some puzzles are good without being [dumb] and contrived, but some were just plain stupid, especially one early in the game where some explosives you just happen to need are hidden in a box in a dark corner of the level.  Some triggered events (especially spawning) are odd, for example, on one level, if you haven't completed a certain objective, you will die without much explaination.[...]

While these flaws greatly detracted from my playing experience, The story is fairly good, certain levels are very fun, and the game hardly ever throws anything so hard that it's agrivating at you.  One battle with a helicopter is a little bit overwhelming, although the hardest part comes at the end of the battle when you have to remember to take off your targeting to hit some enemies.

Overall, Syphon Filter is a great game executed poorly, but I have high hopes for the sequal.  I hope I'm not let down again.
