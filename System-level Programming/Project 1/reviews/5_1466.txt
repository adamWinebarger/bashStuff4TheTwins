I have been playing video games for years. My first console was the original Nintendo and then the Super Nintendo followed by the Nintendo 64. Super Mario 64 came out when I was about 10 years old and it was an instant hit. Super Mario 64 was the greatest Super Mario game of them all. My nephew has a Nintendo 64 and he wants some new games for his birthday. I thought what's better than Super Mario 64. I bought this for his birthday and he will love it. I would recommend Super Mario 64 to anyone who wants to play a fun and family oriented Mario game.
