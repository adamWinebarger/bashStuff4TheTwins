Before buying this game, I strongly recommend downloading the demo off their website first.  As a fan of many of the "God Games" out there, I found this one very unintuitive.  In short, all of the people are  stupid and the game itself does some very dumb things.
For instance,  there are points in the demo where the farmworkers just sit there and drown  as the Nile River rises.  The question isn't "what's causing this  person to just sit there"... the question is "why is this even  occurring?"
That's just one example, there are many, many, more.  Another example?  Ok, I got to a point in the game where half of the  population would just leave.  Then, six months later, they'd all return  again just to repeat the same process again and again year after year.  Does this make any sense?
I found all the micromanagement to be very  tiring.  The object of the game isn't to build an empire, it's to figure  out all the stupid little workarounds it takes to make these people do what  they should be doing without any thought.
This is just the demo, folks!  I strongly suggest you see for yourself before you drop your cash on the  real deal.
