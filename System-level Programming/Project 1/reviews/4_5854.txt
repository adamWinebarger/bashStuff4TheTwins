Although this is a great game, that's extremely fun, you can only play it once.  The graphics are ahead of their time (not now, but they were), and when you use a lightgun it's a party.  But, you end up doing the same thing over and over again.  It's like you die, then just play again, so you can die again then repeat.  It sort of gets old after a while.  If you can get it for a bargain I'd say go for it, but if it's too expensive don't get it, because the time you'll play it won't be worth the money.
Graphics: 5/5 (for their time)
Fun factor: 4/5
Replayability: 2/5
Sound: 4/5 (just normal)
Overall: 4/5
