I admit I did put hours into this game being the hugh Mortal Kombat fan that I am. Gosh I'm sure happy this embarrassing MK game didn't ruin Subzero's career. It is a side scroller in which you are faced with many evil monks (oh, and they're all twins for some reason)..Subzero has many power-ups that prove useless. The mega-sized bosses are boring to fight (oh, and they never die for some reason). Due to the fact that the game supplies no level maps (how generic) a strategy guide would be a must, that is if you cared to bother with the game in the first place. Two good things did come about from this MK disaster.. Quan Chi & Shinnok. For Mortal Kombat that is a must see "MK4" or the new "MK Deadly Alliance". Leave this one in the past where it never should have spawned. 2 1/2 stars is as high as I could go. I'm generous.
