I bought this game so that i can replay my own Dreamcast. The game worked great but i did notice that if you are using a never LCD flat screen, then the laser gun to play the game will not work. You have to use an old tube TV which i happened to have and it all worked great. My brothers and i spent the entire night playing it .I used to play this game in the arcades until my mom would literally drag me out.
