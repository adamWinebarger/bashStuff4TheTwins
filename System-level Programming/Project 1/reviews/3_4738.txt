Many people praise Starcraft for being a great RTS, but I have found my money spent better elsewhere. Starcraft begins as a whole lotta fun, very challenging, but the cons outweigh the pros in this botched game.
Let's start with the good. The internet play is excellent, USE MAP SETTINGS offers many different types of games to play and make. The campaign missions are challenging and fun as well. The units are fun to ... and to employ in your army.
Ok, now the bad. The units are horribly unbalanced. The three different races play so different from each other you actually have to get used to each of them. The unit balance is something that really disgusts me as well. Zealots simply rule over marines, even though in a sense they are supposed to be equals for the two races. The next concern is AI. The AI is simply terrible. I was appalled at how horrible the computer played. I wonder how long Blizzard worked on the AI. The coding must have simply been "BUILD MINER, MINE, ATTACK". The graphics are outdated by this day, but that is not so problematic that anyone should care about it in their decision to buy the game. The map editor could have been improved, but instead people have to download the map editor hacks to make a good map. The voice acting is good, nothing to be ashamed of. The cinematics were excellently done, that is true. But the cinematics don't come in abundance, once you're done with the campaigns, that's it. GOODBYE.
The USE MAP SETTINGS feature is one thing that saves this game from the abyss. It's fun to make custom scenarios that are actually able to be played for a long time, rather than melee games which are simply "... ..."
Well, if you really want a good RTS I do not suggest Starcraft. However, if you like strictly military based RTS's that have good sound effects and a nice system of play, this is your game.
