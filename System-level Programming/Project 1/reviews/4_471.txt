This was the only Breath of Fire game I've beaten.  But I must say that it was fun.  The story and side quests kept me going.
One of the downers was that you can't hardly change your angle.
A big thumbs up going to the fact that you don't have to change screens to get into a battle (like Chrono Trigger).  This saves lots of time and makes thing more dramatic!  Fighting in narrow hallways and thick forests was great!
I'm not going to spoil it for anyone...but the ending sucked badly.  But not enough to stop me from buying the next sequel.  ^_^
