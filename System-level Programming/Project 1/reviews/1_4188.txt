Read ALL of the reviews for this product. Every bad thing that has been said about it is true. Very unreliable, poorly built product. I've had mine only 4 months, it froze up on me last week, and hasn't worked since. A few other people mentioned that customer service with this company is non-existant. Well, that's true also. I'm really angry and disappointed with both this product, and the company. I mean C'mon, these things are expensive! I'll never buy anything from Interact again.
