It has spawned such classic levels (as I recall) such as Luigi's Circuit, Moo Moo Farm, Frappe's Snowland, Toad's Turnpike, Koopa Troopa Beach, Banshee Highway, Bowser's (infamous) Castle, Wario's Stadium and the ridiculously long and bright track, Rainbow Road, which has spawned at LEAST 5 different versions throughout the series!

My all-time favorite level in the game is actually Sherbet Land. It's filled with ice and is just fun to cruise through! And the penguins that you can run into are so cute!

The playable characters are your basic eight: Mario (balance), Luigi (balanced), Princess Peach (lightweight), Toad (lightweight), Yoshi (advanced), Donkey Kong (heavyweight), Wario (heavyweight) and Bowser (the heavi"est"weight).

This game is very, VERY easy to just pick up and play with friends. The controls are simple as all get out and the characters look pretty cool, for a N64 game. The sounds they make are cool too!

If you want something that 4 guys (and/or girls) can enjoy, this is the right move!

* PROS *
-Bright, colorful boards.
-Addicting sound effects.
-Semi-interesting characters.
-Fun tracks.
-4-Way BATTLE. Nuff said.
-8 Semi-unique characters

* CONS *
-Sound comes through in 1-player or 2-player mode, but fails to when playing with 2 or 3 friends
-16 levels just isn't enough to satisfy the average gamer's thirst
-The music can be annoying/nauseating to some
-When you're in 1st, you get crappy items. When you're last, you get the best ones, usually landing you in 1st/2nd/3rd

Cons aside, I spent countless hours with friends that I cherished playing this game. It will bring smiles to your faces for months to come. If you like this and own a Nintendo DS or a DS Lite (shame on ALL of you who don't!), then I totally recommend Mario Kart DS also. More levels and more mayhem. Did I mention even more characters?!

4.5 stars.
