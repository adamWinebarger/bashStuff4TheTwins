I was excited when i got this because i had trouble finding the right one. However when first plugged in it seemed to work fine. Then after only 2 min of game play it stopped working on ch3. Ch4 worked but it was fuzzy and no sound. I then called the company i purchased it from and they offered no help. Not happy about this product.
