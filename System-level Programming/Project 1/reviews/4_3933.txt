This is one kick-[butt] game. I mean it. Literally. About two dozen characters, multiple difficulty levels, a couple of interesting games, this is one super-cool game.
The graphics are great and the fight moves flow so prettily it's almost scary. The characters are all interesting to use, at the very least, and there's something for everyone from an enormous, slow-moving bear to the lightning-quick but tiny Xiou Yu.
My only beef is with the Tekken Ball stage and the side-stepping. Tekken Ball is just silly. It does nothing for your characters, it's decidedly simple, it's . . . well, it's a little kid's game stuck in the middle of a rather bloody 3D fighter. It just doesn't seem to fit with everything else.
The side-stepping is almost ludicrously difficult. You have to tap the controller so lightly that taking a few simple steps to the side becomes impossible. I realize that, logistically, it would be difficult to find another way, but it does hamper your stride, particularly in the Tekken Force stage.
A great game, though.
