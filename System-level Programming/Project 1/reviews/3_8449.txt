The Good: Great graphics, good sense of humor, torturing enemies is fun

The Bad: Unforgiving difficulty, collecting lives is impossible

Wild 9 is developed by those wonderful guys as Shiny who made Earth Worm Jim and MDK. First off, forget the story. The whole story is told in a three pages in the booklet. You play this kid who has this thing on his arm and it releases this energy that can grab enemies and smack them around. You're actually supposed to torture enemies such as throwing them in giant grinders, spike pits etc. You also have to sometimes throw them in a spike pit and use them as stepping-stones, it's very funny.

The graphics are really good for a PS1 game with bright colors, and smooth textures. You can collect coins for extra life, but I found this impossible. There are 99 in each level and you have to get every single one to get another life. So, if you run out of lives you'll be restarting the level constantly. The game is very unforgiving, but if you're good at these games you won't mind. The game controls very well and isn't slippery, unresponsive for slow. Everything is quick and simple. So, if you want a good platformer for your PSP or your PS2, or hey! Even your PS3 pick up Wild 9.
