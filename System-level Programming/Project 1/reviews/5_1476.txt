When i got my n64 years ago, i bought mario kart 64 and i liked it :)
But i never bought mario 64, i played it and completed it though. I loved mario 64, the gameplay is awesome, the graphics are cool (for that times). The only thing i regret is that i never bought it to have it as a memento of my n64 gaming times.

I loved it so much that i tried to find it in a market, i found a lot of n64 games but not mario 64. I just wanted to play it one last time to remember the good old days of n64 gaming. So i had to download a n64 emulator and play it, but its not the same to play with a keyboard than to play with the joystick. Anyway i could play the entire game and that made me happy.

For all those people who played the good old days of n64 should have this game because is a memory of the n64 and the good old times of gaming.
