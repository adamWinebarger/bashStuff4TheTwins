For The Love Of God Don't Believe The Hype! This game had so many people kissing it's butt it wasn't funny. I got it and it was a huge let down. Soul Blade on psone was better then this! Sure it's all pretty, but it's basically just a virtua fighter clone with wepons and smaller backgrounds.alot of the charactors are basicly the same (Astoroth&Rock/Mina&Kilick/Lizardman&Sophitia/Inferno&Edgemaster) The backgrounds while pretty are basically just the old 2-D backdrops used on the first 3-D fighters. The "innovative" world tour mode had been done in SFA3 already so that wasn't a huge plus either. Dead or Alive 2 kicked this things butt as did the painfull to play VF3. If you have either of those forget about this.
