I hate first person shooters.  I really do.
Except this one.
Why?  Well, Unreal Tournament is hardly the traditional first person shooter of  "blast everything to pieces and maybe you'll survive".  Sure, it  starts like that, just like every other shooter ought to in order to  familiarize you with the control system and interface, but immediately  thereafter you begin to see that with game modes like Capture the Flag,  Domination, and Assault, things are entirely different.
Strategy becomes  an enormous factor in playing this game, purely because your objectives  will often require teamwork.  The game has made this easy by providing you  with the ability to individually change each of your robotic teammates' AI.  Better yet: play with your friends via the internet (NOTE: internet play  is extremely laggy, so i wouldnt recommend even trying it without a  broadband connection of some kind).
The graphics are decidedly sharp for  a low-polygon count game, and the lighting and textures are superb.  Animation and other movement is actually somewhat realistic, and its nice  to see that things are finally changing in the world of FPS.
