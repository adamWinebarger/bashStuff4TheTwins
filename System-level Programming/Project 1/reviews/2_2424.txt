This product is unreliable third-party hardware. I suggest you buy the official Nintendo Expansion Pak that will NOT ruin your N64 like the one on this page is said to do. If you value the life of your console and games, use the official Pak and not the generic hardware advertised on this page. Most people won't notice by looking at the picture, but the official Nintendo Pak has a circle pattern in the red top portion unlike the parallel slits in this image. If you aren't familiar with the official Pak, it is very easy to see the image and think it's the official thing. Make sure you either purchase one on Ebay where you can see the pictures of the actual item you're purchasing. Or read the Amazon Seller's item description very carefully before buying to make sure they explicitly claim you are buying the official Nintendo brand Pak.

I post this only because this page is misleading, making you think you are purchasing the official Nintendo Expansion Pak, which you are not.
