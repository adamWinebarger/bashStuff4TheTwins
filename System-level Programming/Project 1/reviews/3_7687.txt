Believe me, this is nowhere near the worst game of all time. It is strictly an average game. It breaks no new ground, offers very little in the way of new and fresh adventures, and it's explicit blood and guts get tiresome after a while. But where it excells is in the horror aspect, with well animated and truely frightning monsters lurking in the back alleys, there is much to fear.
Set in Victorian London (circa 1840), you assume the role of either a preist or a young student apprentice. The former excells with strength while the other excells at agility. Both offers skills essential to survival. Your task is to defeat all the monsters that an evil scientist has unleashed. Cliched as the story is, the action is fun for any fan of "Resident Evil" or "Tomb Raider", with the action in the third person similar to the other survival horror games.
The graphics are nice, but dark and moody. This makes the gaming experience unpleasant over the long run. The music is nicely done, and reminds me of the moods set in "Silent Hill". The action is nice, and will please gamers who crave action and painting walls with your enemies. But in the way of deep story or character development, you may want to look elsewhere.
Not very bad, but not very good either.
