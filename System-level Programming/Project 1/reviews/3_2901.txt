I live in a neighborhood with around 30 children in it, that all play Nintendo. I love Nintendo to no end but these controllers break easily! That is why so many colors and versions of them are sold! The buttons break easily where they no longer work when pressed, especially the L and R buttons, the directional pad also breaks easily where you press up on the pad and it moves left or you press down and it moves left. Because of the handlebars on the side of the controller, that allows the plastic bends quite easily. I have noticed when children get upset or frustrated with a game they twist those handle bars, causing them to break, bend or crack. However a controller is a controller, but for this price you can find something cheaper that is more sturdy and reliable.
