If you don't have a Dreamcast and you love Capcom's Vs. games, Marvel Super Heroes Vs. Street Fighter for Playstation is a decent alternative.  There are some notable flaws, as the Playstation hardware is just not made to run these type of games.  For instance, the biggest let down is the abscence of tag-teaming (the Playstation does not have enough RAM to store more than 2 characters within one loading session).  Then there's the animation...there are definetly more than a few frames missing, but once you get used to it it's OK.  However, there a few gameplay extras Capcom included to keep players interested: a "helper" character for each match, a healing vitality gauge, and a combo system that allows you to chain hyper combos together.  Best of all though, the gameplay stays relatively fast with minimal slowdown (with the exception of extreme activity).  This is another very noticeable improvement over the Playstation ports of Marvel Super Heroes and X-Men Vs. Street Fighter.  If nothing else, Capcom is to be commended for putting up with the Playstation's limitations to squeeze out the best possible port of this game.
