I bought this game way back and recently played it again.. well..

the game was easy to beat when i was 6 and its still as easy.

Well, my problem(s)?

Not enough characters and its just not very fun and.. yeah that makes it boring.. but if ur a fan of the older games ( like me ) you may like this game ( unlike me )

It's cheap now so, I guess it wouldn't hurt to pick it up.. it costs as much cash as to rent a game at the videostore..

so do what you want with it.
