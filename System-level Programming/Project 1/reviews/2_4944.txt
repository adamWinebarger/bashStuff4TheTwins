I have most of the major flight sims and now I have this and have only worked with it a bit but I find it a little too overcomplicated, it's taxing even for someone who is a flight simmer and is already flight tested and combat tested.
The graphics are good but first there was the necessity to download a patch which at 25mb is the largest game patch I've ever seen, the list of fixes is enough to make you question why they released it in that form anyway.
Although the amount of interactivity is less with the bombers in Janes Attack Squadron so is the level of overhead.
If you are really a B17 nut though and you want total realistic immersion in that plane then you'll like the sim.
