I bought my controller from gtsboy for $22.99. It came in good shape. You could tell it was used because the buttons moved easily and they weren't stiff (that's a good thing!). However, the joystick had a problem. The character would keep moving forward without the joystick being moved so I had to open it up and clean it a bit, but other than that it was a great buy!
