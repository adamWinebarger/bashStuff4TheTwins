I remember renting for the weekend at our local video store ages ago. It took about an hour to figure out how to make the grappler hit the sweet spot so I could get to the second floor. That was only the first level! In case you're wondering, I had no problem getting past the first stage in other video games. So it wasn't my lack of experience, it was the abysmal game design. The music, or at least the music I heard (as I stopped playing after the first level) was mediocre. If you really want to play a Batman Game for SNES, I recommend "Batman Returns" and "The Adventures of Batman and Robin". Some "bad" games can still be fun but this one isn't.
