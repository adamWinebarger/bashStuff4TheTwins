Once again, Hyrule is being threatened by the forces of evil! As Link, the chosen hero you solve countless puzzels, and fight many, many, monsters! This game has about everything! Good graphics, great gameplay, and a wonderful story.
Ganondorf, the evil in the game, needs to get the tree spiritual stones to open the Tempe of Time. He threatened the people who have them, but they didn't give him the stones. Link goes on quests to get the tree stones. Once he gets them and Zelda, the princess, gives him the Ocarina of Time,  he opens the Temple of Time. But little does he know, Ganondorf followed him.
Seven years later link wakes up and Ganondorf rules Hyrule. He spreaded five of the six medallions and had monsters gaurd them. You get the only medallion Ganondorf didn't have and go on a quest to find the others.
This game is great and has a wonderful selection of weapons and other things. I highly recommend it and for anyone who has a Nintendo 64, get this game for your 64 collection isn't complete without it.
