Gauntlet Legends is a mindless hack, slash, burn, and blast game. There is nothing wrong with aimlessly wandering about creepy dungeons, mashing buttons, and mowing down bad guys. It's especially fun with companions. This game is a classic. I enjoy the graphics, the audio effects, the characters, the different environments, and seemingly endless procession of monsters in this game. Finding all the switches one needs to progress is sometimes tiresome. The game's storyline is linear, but that's okay. Sometimes a formulaic approach is just what the doctor ordered!
