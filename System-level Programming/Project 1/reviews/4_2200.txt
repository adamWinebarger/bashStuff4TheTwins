The first of the Mario Party games!

It really is an awesome game. I only played it at a friend's house as a child really, so now, many years later, I finally decided to get it for myself, along with 2 and 3. The n64 games are classic.
I really only play it by myself, but it is so much funner to play with friends. You can get so angry when someone steals your star. This is how you get in fights with your friends.
The mini games are fun, not as fun as 2 and 3 though.
Never going to regret buying this game :)
