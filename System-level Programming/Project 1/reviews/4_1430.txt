this is wat made me love mario. mario 64!

this is the biggest game crammed into a cartridge ive seen, its musically awesome, graphically it shows age, and the camera isn't as good as it could be, but I still haven't beaten it since then! thats how massive & how much gameplay there is to it!

I remember sliding down caves & smashing boulders back in the day, now that a friend sold it to me, Im in love with it!
