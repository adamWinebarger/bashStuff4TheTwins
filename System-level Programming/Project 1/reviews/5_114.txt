I bought these to use with band hero and with the voice games for xbox 360.  It worked well, plugged into the xbox 360 without any issues.  The microphone worked properly and was just as seller had described.  My voice is heard clearly on it and we were able to play both games usuing this mic.  Great deal with the price.  I would recommend it.
