I don't think this game is good it is I beat the game before and it was ruined for me the levels were empty feeling it was a crappy game I like about this game is the animals and the graphics. The Gnasty Gnorc boss fight was more like a chase instead of destruction I think this is a touch of old flights and bad name levels who could name a boss called Blowhard? I give this an above average 2 stars out of 5
