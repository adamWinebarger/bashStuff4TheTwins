I like this game a lot. The multiplayer, either skirmish or with some friends, is among the best out there. The game allows for many different ways to attack, like ground invasion, missiles, air strikes, artillery fire, or just nuke the enemy bases. Plus, every attack has a defense, so good players can stop just about every attack against them. This can lead to very long matches with no clear cut winners.

The largest flaw with this game is its age. The engine doesn't allow zooming in or out. Most commanding happens through the mini-map, which can take some adjusting. However, a more advanced engine that supports Total Annihilation maps and mods has been released. It's named "TA Spring". I highly recommend that engine as well. Aside from the engine, there were no major flaws to this game. It is one of the best RTS games ever made.
