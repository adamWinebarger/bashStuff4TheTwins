Following the popularity of Metal Gear Solid, Syphon Filter is a game that stands up very well on its own.  It has enough that is different that it can be considered a very good game in its own right.  SF has a very nice  blend of shoot-em-up and stealth missions that it is never the same thing  over and over.  However, it does find a few things lacking.  The save  system is horrendous.  You can only save at points that are very far apart.  The checkpoint system which allows you to restart at the last checkpoint  helps this a little, but being able to save a checkpoints would have made  this game much better.  Also, some scenarios are very difficult, especially  if you've been playing it through and miss one detail.  Most likely, it's a  detail that you will miss everytime, which can make a few missions very  frustrating.  The cut scenes are good and the game control is good.  The  wide variety of weapons is very interesting as well.  All in all, this is a  very good game marred by a very few flaws.
