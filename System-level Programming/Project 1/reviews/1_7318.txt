This game seems like it was thrown together to keep as much speed as possible. Back in the early 90s Genesis was the blistering fast system. As per the SEGA gargon. Truth is it was slghtly faster then SNES but couldn't handle the colors. So now was know why they left over half the colors of the orginial. Now we are stock with this thing. They kept most of the moves and all the colors, but doesn't have any intro or ending animation which means it looks half done. Before you defend this game, think of this. Super Street Fighter looked great, but they they just didn't take the time porting this game. And much like Mortal Kombat it looks drab, choppy, and well peiced together.

 On the other hand if you are a collector and you want a PR port check out 32X. It is one of the best ports out there. This is one of the most ported games of all time, and the Genesis is one of the ones to try to see how much they took out and how bad it was.
