I have to admit that I never was a victim of the "Tomb Raider Hype Machine". I liked the idea of a 3rd person perspective game where your character can do alot of tricks but the whole idea of the big-boobed Lara Croft just turned me off.  I bought this for 4 bucks at the used software house and played it for about 2 hours. I liked the save game feature somewhat, it should be more specific. I felt like banging my head against a wall after be killed for the 50th time because I didn't hit the "jump" button in the right sequence with the "run" button at the correct prescribed time.  The interface is just too rigid for a game like this, it reminded me alot of that old "Dragon's Lair" game. And I got real tired of the stupid puzzles.  I think the real reason for TR being so popular is that its the first non-adult game with a overly-endowed female protagonist. It can't be because of the gameplay.
