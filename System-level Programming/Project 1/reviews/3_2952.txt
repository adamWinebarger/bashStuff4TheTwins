I feel so hypnotically enchanted floating through endless rings as Superman with the distant soaring effects peacefully sounding in the background.  For the first few minutes Superman seems challenging as an early 3D experiment to figure out which ideas work and which ones can be tossed aside and... you'd certainly *think* that floating through ring after ring would get boring after a while but... the opposite happens.  You get unusually attached to the endless task.

After a while these floating rings just seem to call my name.  It's like I'm destined to fly through them for all eternity.  I don't want to do anything else in life but fly through these hypnotic rings.  Sometimes I bump into bad guys and shoulder bash them away, other times I pick up items and toss them at specific targets but... the rings.  They always call me back for several minutes of peaceful daydreaming hypnotism at its purest.  I'm enthralled in this games beauty.  The graphics are decent too.  I have to go now.  The rings are waiting for me.  *stares off into space*
