I loved this game from the instant that I installed it.
It's funny, imaginative, and actually allows you to ride the rides!
It's far too easy, being aimed toward a younger audience, but that never put me off.  I would reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys the Sim series.
My only disappointment is the lack of updates.  The game is so outdated now that it will no longer run on my PC, because of Windows XP being installed.

I wish that a newer version would be released so that I can play one of my all time favorites again.
