First off my rating is high because I really enjoyed this game.
2ndly it was a N64 RPG, which I don't remember there being many.

You end up using the elements as magic and you mix and match to kind of make your own play style.
The battle mechanics were odd, but I always enjoyed games that were challenging so you had to think out what you were going to do, sometimes you would lose a battle due to making a bad move, and you can learn from it and do better.

Unless your someone who likes to play old games, avoid this one, there are games which are all around upgrades.
Try Fate or Fable.
