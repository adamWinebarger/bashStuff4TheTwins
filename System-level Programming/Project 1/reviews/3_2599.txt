Star Wars Episode 1 Racer.  Well, in this game you play as one of many characters that can be unlocked by winning races and setting records.  After each race, if you place high enough, you can upgrade your podracer by  buying new parts, or searching through Watto's Junkyard.  There is a  multiplayer, but it is pretty standard, just a split screen racing option.  This is a pretty good game, and ... it's a great buy.  I commend  Lucasartss for the feeling of really fast racing, but besides this and the  ability to buy parts, this game is essentially nascar on different planets  with space ships and a winner title.
