I love the game. It came fast, but it was in horrible shape. For as much as I paid for the game, I would think they would at least of cleaned it. It definitely did not work out the box, I had to use alcohol to clean off the connectors and scrub all the grime off the cartridge. If I had paid $5 I wouldn't be complaining to much.
