Now that I've gone back and started replaying Diablo, I realize how spoiled I've become playing Darkstone. Major improvements were made the the Diablo engine by GOD when they put this game out, and Diablo actually feels somewhat kludgy in comparison. Ability to change camera angle, the Previously Visited Places menu, that sort of thing. GOD/Take 2 did a good job with the patches, as well, not only fixing some D3D problems in the original version but adding playability as well. A fine product overall that's still got me banging away at monsters after months of single-minded playing.
