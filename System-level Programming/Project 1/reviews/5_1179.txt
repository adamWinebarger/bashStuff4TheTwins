The most recent LoZ games, in my opinion, have all been fairly average.  Wind Waker was the latest actually good LoZ game.  But of all the LoZ games, OoT is just plain incredible.

In this game, you play as Link as he grows from a child into a young man while on his quest to defeat Ganon and save the world from ultimate, evil rule.  Along the way, you meet many friends and face amazing boss battles.

The graphics (at the time) were just incredible.  It really made me enjoy looking at and playing the game.  Nintendo really did a great job in this department.

The gameplay is like no other.  One of the few incredible games to utilize the C Buttons for vital controls, this game felt really comfortable to play, and there's tons to do in the game besides just beating it.  Also, throughout the game, you are forced to travel back and forth through time and play as Young or Adult Link to complete the game, which is awe-inspiring in my opinion.  Sadly, after doing little everything, there's no addictive mini-games to really play and not much else to do, but go through the game again and again.

The sound is incredible, and the music has never been better.  I found myself turning the volume on the TV all the way up while playing this game, because the sound was that good!

If you're an avid gamer, yet you've never played this game, then something's really wrong with you.  Pick this game up and play it 'till your fingers fall off (which I guarantee you'll do).  This game is worth buying and owning for as long as you even are alive.
