This is a must own for Dreamcast owners and Sonic fans.  There are six major campaigns, Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, Amy, Big the Cat, and Gamma.  Each have their own style of gameplay and each campaign adds to the story.  When you beat al six campaigns, a seventh and final campaign allows you to play as Super Sonic to conclude the story.

Now there are a few flaws.  Sometimes the control in the game is pretty bad and the camera doesn't always go where you want it to go.  My least favorite campaign is Big the Cat's because it focuses less on action and focuses on fishing.

But it's still a fun game and I can still play it.
