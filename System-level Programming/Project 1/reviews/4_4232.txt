Anyone ever play Privateer: Armada?  This really reminds me of that allot.  The great sweeping star wars saga has been replaced by nothing more then a third rate game of chess. The special effects are cheesy and the so-called battles take forever.  Save your money and don't buy this one.
If you want a great Star Wars game get X-Wing or X-Wing Alliance.
