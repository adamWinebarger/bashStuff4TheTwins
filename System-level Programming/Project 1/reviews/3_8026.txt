Silicon graphics and the usual play control equal an easy to learn 3D fighting game. The thing that makes this game really unique are the killer combinations of moves, and the fact that there are tons of special moves for each character, but then when you start doing a combination of moves there are even more special moves! The fighting arenas are visually astounding, especially Spinal's ship. There is even cool fighting music to keep up with the pace of the fight. Speaking of the pace, there are 100s of options, including the speed of the fight, disabling certain moves, damage, and anything you can imagine. Another great part about this game is that there is an actual scale of challenge, which makes it anywhere from easy for a beginner - to difficult for a master gamer. The only disappointing thing is that the original fighters are better than the four new ones.
