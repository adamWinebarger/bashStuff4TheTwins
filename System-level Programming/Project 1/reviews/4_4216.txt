I've always loved the board game version of "Life" - I played it hundreds of times with my family while I was growing up.  The computer game version stuck to the board game as closely as possible.  You spin the wheel exactly like the board game, your little car moves around just like the board game (they even copied the board almost exactly!).
It's pretty fun - I've played it a few dozen times and really enjoyed it.  I wish that when you are generating your character there were a few more options (your character choices are EXTREMELY limited), but that is the only real fault I could find with the game.
The graphics are cartoonish - but it fits!  Whenever you land on a spot, there is a short little clip showing what happened to you - these are pretty funny!  Overall, it's a cute game.  It would be perfectly acceptable for kids too - there is nothing bad in the game at all!  Since its so cheap, I definitely recommend getting it and playing around, especially if you're a fan of the board game!
