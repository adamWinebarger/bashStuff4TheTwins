Virtua Fighter may have a hard time competing with games such as DOA2, or tekken tag, but believe me this was what paved the way for those games.  All though it lacks where the others seem to excell with story modes and hidden characters, virtua fighter makes up with character variety and a great display of styles (drunken style, mantis, sumo, etc.).  I was shocked at how fun this game was even after playing more modern games.  Even with new games on the market, I think i'll be playing this one for a while.  The teacher of fighting games.
