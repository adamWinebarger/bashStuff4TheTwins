I rented this game with my friend and we played it the whole time he was over. Well about a year after that I decided to buy it. The thing I like best about the game is the Stunt level.  But after having it for quite awhile it gets pretty boring. The racing part against the computers is really hard, sometimes I can't even get to third place. If you liked San Fransico Rush you'll love this game.
