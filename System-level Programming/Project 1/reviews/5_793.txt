I played this when it first came out on the Nintendo 64.  Once I started I couldn't put it down until I beat every level on every difficulty.  Back than my friends and I worked 2nd shift and after work would come over and play multiplayer into the morning.  Occasionally I still get nostalgic and pop the cartridge in to revisit my favorite levels.  The graphics are dated now but the game play is still fun.  Researching the games development history to find things that never made it into the finished version but whose code is still included in the cartridge and can be accessed is interesting as well. If you have an old Gameshark for instance you can use it to walk to the mysterious island off in the distance of the Dam Level.  A great game all around.
