I see alot of people on here griping and nitpicking about what this game has and doesn't have.  Is it something groundbreaking? Nah...  Is it something that hasn't been done before? Nah... Is it still a pretty darn nifty game?  you betcha!  It's a RTS, period, and all RTS games seem to suffer universally from similar ailments.  These being certain tactics, units, et al that are very powerful, yada yada... just play it!  I happen to think the graphics are pretty darn nice myself, and the elevation changes are quite good as well. FOUR sides to choose from gives a nice variety of units and such.  Not alot to be said, some things could have been done better, but it's a cool game.  I think, however, that the "super units" could be all together bypassed if Cavedog and other Designers (Blizzard for instance) would adopt the Tech Level variable, a la Command & Conquer, for multiplay games.  Sometime I wana just batten down and have an all-out slug fest with the basic 'grunt' units in the game. All the upper-level stuff is cool, but it really does detract from the fun of the game(s) because there's no strategy involved in dropping a Nuke/Magic Death Spell/Whatever, on your opponent. Anyhow, I ramble, hehehe, did I mention this is a good game and you should buy it?
