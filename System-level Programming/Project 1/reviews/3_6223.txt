The Ultima Collection include what could possibly be the best RPG games of all time. UC includes all of the Ultima titles from Akalabeth (the game the Ultima series was based on) to Ultima VIII.
In order to run these games, you literally have to be a computer expert.  You have to run these games from the DOS prompt. Before you get to play any of these games, you have to fix a lot of settings which an average computer user would have no idea how to set them up, or even what they mean (I'm still trying to find out what an "IRQ" is.) Also, many of the new computers do not have a PC Speaker, which all of the games require to play any sound effects and music.
By the way, do not expect Ultima I: Exodus to look anything like its NES counterpart.  In Ultima I through IV, graphics are very poorly defined; everything consists of plain colored squares.
If you can actually manage to setup and execute the programs smoothly, then have at this game.  Otherwise, I would recommend playing the NES and SNES Ultima titles.
