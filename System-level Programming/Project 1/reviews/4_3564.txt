This is one of the better N64 games if you have the 4meg expansion pack and it's good and creepy but some of the puzzles could have been a bit more easy to figure out but if you don't have an N64 get the GameCube remake as the Graphics are much better but still worth picking up and adding to your N64 collection :)
