This N64 title was exclusive for N64 at one point but that doesn't really matter.  South Park 64 looked really promising at first and it truly was with it's shocking yet really great graphics some what game play.  And I was looking forward to one of the things South Park is best at.  Stupid Funny plot.  It kina had one but ends up failing AND I LOVE SOUTH PARK IT'S ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS OUT THERE.  But for a game it's just..AVERAGE.  Nothing new just run and gun but I liked the whole senario stories like the visitors and the Turkey episodes.  Those were great.  The game starts off really well as you battle your way through vicious Turkeys but once you beat the Turkey boss it just drags on with the same ol run n' gun and then fight the boss with nothing New.  It's just the same ol' same ol.

Graphics are really good and one of the best on the N64.  It really shows what the N64 can do.  One of the best parts are the bosses cause there 3d animation is sooooo good.  But that is just it...Graphics... Now lets get to the problem

Gameplay gets really boring after awhile.  Really...It's just the same ol same ol but the game is great for Die Hard SouthPark Fans.  I thought the game could have bin better but hey It wasn't But They still try to do a good job.  But still...Gameplay is just a lil boring..

Sound is perfect...Trey Parker and Matt Stone do a great job as teh voices of those crazy boys.  Sound is great ok!

Pros

Graphics

Sound

Voices

Cons

Gameplay is just way to boring and a bit tedious

Seems like playing the first Episode over again

The ending is sooo crappy I was really expecting something big and cool but just same lame ending...Then again it's just a game based on a show but seriously.

Over all I give it ....a

3.2 out of 5 stars

Get this game at your own risk but I recomend Chef's lUv shack...Much much betta and fun mini games.
