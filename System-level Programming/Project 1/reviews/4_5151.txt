"Symphony of the Night" is considered the pinnacle of the Castlevania series, and with good reason.  At a time when side-scrollers were falling to full 3-D games, Konami proved that there was still room for a good 2-D game in the gaming industry.
"Symphony" boasts impressive environments, huge bosses, multiple endings, creepy music, and more weapons and items than you can shake a stick at.  My only problem is that it's just too much for me to remember--when I'm being mauled by Beezlebub is not the time to look up the "Dark Metamorphosis" spell.  If you take the time to learn all your spells, as well as the ins-and-outs of all the Familiars, though, you won't have that big a problem.
I have just a few picks about the game:
1.) As stated before, the inventory/spell system is HUGE and can be intimidating.
2.) Voice acting.  Aughh.  Wish there was an option to turn the original Japanese voice acting on, like you can in "Lament of Innocence."
3.) Bosses.  Bosses are typically easy, provided you have enough health-restore items.  However, I frequntly found myself being turned into a bloody pulp (literally) by the sheer numbers and strength of ordinary enemies--isn't it suppossed to be the BOSSES who kill you over and over again?
Don't get me wrong, "Symphony" is one of the best Castlevania titles to date--but if you're looking for a more user-friendly Castlevania game, I suggest "Aria of Sorrow" for the Game Boy Advance.
