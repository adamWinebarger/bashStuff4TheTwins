This game calls its civilizations "races" and has slavery as a prominet part of the game, but there is the abolition eventually. It does not feel like a successor to Civilization II. The wonders of the world are  all new, as is the technology tree. The interface is new, and you cannot  use a keyboard to move units. I did not care much for its supposedly  improved graphics over Civilization II, I did not see that much  improvement, and by now the graphics are not cutting edge anyway.
There  are too many new units and cumbersome rules associated with them. The  cursed televangelist keeps popping up out of nowhere, converting cities and  eating into your empire's resources. The lawyer hides just as you are about  to move a military unit to kill him. Building cities in space and under  water may sound like a lot of fun and a novelty compared to the two  original Civilizations. But playing at lower levels, this won't be  interesting, becuase you will learn how to crush your opponents before  acquiring the technology for underwater and space construction; at higher  levels, the game becomes too difficult and too cluttered with units and  characters to persevere with marine and space existence. The only real  improvement over Civilization II is that governments are more stable during  war. In Civ II, if you wanted to wage a serious war, you had to install  monarchy or fundamentalism, or your government would collapse. Bottom line:  maybe it's because I am older, but I did not enjoy this game as much as  Civilization II. What comes out of "Call to Power" screams for  help to bring more original and well-crafted games to the market.
