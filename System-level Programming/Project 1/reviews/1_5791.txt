I thought the Clock Tower games looked interesting, but I was sorely disappointed.  The controls (point-and-click) are out-of-date and sometimes do not make sense, the voice acting is AWFUL, the movements are SLOW, the  graphics are mediocre, the storyline (as much as I could handle) was  corny...  There are many endings to the game, but who can sit through  it?
VERDICT:  Don't even rent this one, unless you are a HUGE (and  curious) fan of the first game.
