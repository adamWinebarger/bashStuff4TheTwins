It makes you think. I agree that few new surprises are discovered after the first bit fo time, but I find I can keep playing it whenever I need just a little tedious activity to occupy me. (Personally, I like to listen to books on tape while I play--but that's just me).

My suggestion? Buy it, it's worth it.
