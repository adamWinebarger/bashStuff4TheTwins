I bought this game back in December. I played it for about 2 solid hours. I come to realize that this is it. All the same levels are like this. So boring and so not like the movies, and the movement and the weapons in this game are terrible. Not to mention the animation of the Aliens, they look like they are break dancing or having an upright seizure, moving back and forth like a tiger pacing in a cage. The alien creatures are so predictable in this game, and not the least bit scary. The parasites things that crawl on the ceiling, walls, and floor is perfectly done, but I am going to have to say that even the DOOM games bring better action and better background and goals and weapon options compared to this Alien game. The PC game, ALIEN VS PREDATOR is by far way better than this, and is true to the plot and movie action.

Its too bad I spend 12 dollars on this game, I am going to re-sell it right away and let some other sucker buy it.
