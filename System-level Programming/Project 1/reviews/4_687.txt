In comparison to other N64 games, this piece is a worthwhile buy.  The single player mode is challenging enough to warrant playing for a while to unlock the secret characters.  Two player mode gets pretty boring, pretty quickly because there are only 6 tracks to race on so there's not much variety.  The stunt mode is the main appeal of the game and could easily occupy you for hours.  However, it soon just becomes a thumb spinning frenzy for points.  Given this is fun for a while but it gets all that white junk inside the control stick holder, and ruins thumb coordination for the rest of the day.  So buy this game and spin in circles to your heart's content.
