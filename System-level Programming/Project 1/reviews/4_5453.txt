I played this game right after I finished Metal Gear Solid and while I was a little let down from the switch I found the game entertaining.  I played it at like 3 in the morning with the lights out and it can kinda freak you out.  It is an old game now but if you liked the Resident Evil series and never got to try this one pick it up for your PS1 or PS2.  Also if you are thinking about getting SH2 definately play this game cause it helps you understand the town.
