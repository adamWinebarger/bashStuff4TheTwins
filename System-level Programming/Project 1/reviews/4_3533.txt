Resident Evil: Code Veronica on the Dreamcast has the same mutant/zombie killing and gore everyone would expect from a Resident Evil game.  The graphics are considerably better in this latest installment of the series, and there are plently of new monsters to exterminate. As for the weapons, there isn't much new here...but at least it's kept relatively realistic with shotguns, pistols, and sub-machine guns, ect. The story is involved and although at some points predictable, it's executed well from start to finish.  Unfortunately, as in the other Resident Evil games, there is a lot of back tracking that must be done to complete the game...and having limited item space makes it all the more time consuming.  If you've played the previous Resident Evil games, you know what to expect.  There's also plently of fun secrets to unlock (like Battle Mode), and they add a considerable amount of replay value.  Resident Evil: Code Veronica is yet another great reason to own a Dreamcast.
