This is argubaly the worst system EVER. The music is horrible sounding comparing to the beauty of the playstation. There are no good RPG games for  this system. The graphics in most games are nowhere near they could be and  overall a pathetic system. The best game it had was Goldeneye 007 and in my  mind that is the ONLY good game besides Perfect Dark to appear on the  entire system during its 4 years on the American Market.
