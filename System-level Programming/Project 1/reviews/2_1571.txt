game came on time and works. This game is pretty bad in my opinion I would stick to the 2d whipping action if your looking for fun. You choose from 2 pretty lame characters, camera angles are no good and the gameplay it's self is not great. Get this game to add to your collection but other then that this game is a waste of energy.
