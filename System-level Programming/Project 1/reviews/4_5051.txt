This is a terrific game for children who love the Toy Story films.  All the regular characters make appearances and it's just too fun controlling Buzz Lightyear!  I only wish the graphics, sound and control were a bit more polished.  The dificulty comes mainly from a constantly moving camera (but you can fix it when needed) and a bit too loose control.  For the younger gamers though these drawbacks won't matter much as it's fun just wondering around the levels and finding your friends.  You get to explore Andy's house, Al's Toy Barn and an airport among others.  Older and more experienced gamers will probably want to pass on this due to the laskluster graphics and unsophicated gameplay.  But if you're a fan as much as I am then you'll be able to look past these drawbacks and enjoy the game.  One thing to keep in mind is that to save your game you need to have a controller pack.
