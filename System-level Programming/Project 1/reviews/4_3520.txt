Graphics wise this game is awesome. The control is easy to get used to and it is fun.
  The problems with this game begin early on. The main problem is the puzzles and bosses. There are many times when you will get stuck because you didn't move some block 8 hours ago, of course you can't go back so your only alternative is to start over. Very frustrating.
