Graphics: 8/10 - These are often stunning but at times a bit murky. Mostly they are really fabulous to look at, though, in every scene the makers of Crash have put in a lot of effort.
Sound: 7/10 - The animals could've made some more sounds but the creatures that talk do it clearly and well. Mostly the score is playing in the background so there isn't much sound to be heard.
Value: 9/10 - Value for money indeed! Once you've finished, you'll want to start all over again!
Overall: 8/10 - Great game with an excellent reputation. Crash 2 and 3 surpass it slightly, but this is still an easy-on-the-brain, fun and original idea.
