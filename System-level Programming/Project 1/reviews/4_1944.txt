Crash's 1st game (as I reviewed) is my favortie debut game, but his sequel blows me away.  There's one reviewer who says this is an improvement on the original with some sassy style.  They're %100 correct.  The game's best improvements and worst flaws are all I will list, because you already know where I stand if you've read my review on the 1st game (and go check it out if you haven't).

Best Improvement: Saving System.  This allows you to save at anytime, so you're not going to have to get off (becuase your parents said so, of course) without saving all your hard and handy work and having to have to do it all over again.

2nd Best Improvement: You have 5 levels to choose from at anytime.  You don't have to go in order.

3rd Best Improvement: More moves.  Crash is looking good with all his new stunts.

4th Best Improvement: Vehicles.  Crash gets to drive some neato vehicles, including my favorite, the jet pack.

5th Best Improvement: Greater and better bosses, (including N. Gin).

6th Best Improvement: Bigger, Better, and More secret levels.

7th Best: New characters.  I'm lovin' the new addition of characters, including Coco Bandicoot, Crash's sister (whom I think should've been in the 1st game).

8th Best Improvement: It's easier to collect gems, and there's a new addition, crystals.

Worst Flaw: Well, it would be nice if Tawna hadn't suddenly disappeared.  I think she should've been crucial to the entrtie series, not just the 1st game.

2nd Worst Flaw: You can't revisit bosses without a secret code.  You should be able to revisit bosses without having to have to look for secret codes to do so.

So, those are all the improvements and flaws.  As you can see, better the the 1st game, by far.
