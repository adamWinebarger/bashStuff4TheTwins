I order this a few days ago and it came no longer than three. The memory card is what I mainly wanted and the rumble pak. I'll just let anyone who plays as the fourth player can use it because I had three rumble paks for my other controllers before this order, but no memory card yet. When I order this it said like new and guess what! It actually came brand new sealed in the hard plastic that normally takes scissors to cut. I like this seller because they mean what they say. I also ordered this in the used section which is also weird (I still got it new but im sure you know that). Like most people said the rumble pak is kinda more heavier, but im not even going to use it anyway because again I already have a rumble pak for my other controllers. The only thing I really hate about the rumble is that all rumble paks I own take triple (AAA) batteries. The problem with that is batteries run out. I do have some advice for some people purchasing this. If you want a rumble pak try to find rechargable triple (AAA) batteries if you can. By the way the memory card can also be used alone without the rumble pak. It should of been powered in the controller though. I guess thats old school for you.
