If you haven't purchased/played Final Fantasy VII, and are the least bit interested in doing so, I strongly recommend purchasing it. For the first few months after completing it, you will swear that no entertainment device comes close to meeting the caliber of this game, and this isn't necessarily unfounded. An astoundingly large proportion of people who have played this game have made this claim (and I admit--I was guilty of this as well).
After you play a couple other games after your first run-through of FFVII, though, the problems with the game become glaring. The character controls, for one, are stiff as a board. Whereas, one year prior to the release of this game, Nintendo was striving to revolutionize play mechanics with the fluid movements of a 64-bit Mario, Square seems to have been perfectly content with giving the player control within barely two-dimensions. The menu control (battle/item screen, etc.) is acceptable, but it's time these engineers help consumers buy something new, instead of the 7th installment of a stale interface.
Graphically, the game is, well, cool. From vistas to closets, FFVII gets environment design right. Quite honestly, there is no other game (Final Fantasy or not) which has matched the coolness factor evoked from Final Fantasy VII's graphics. The character graphics are hideous, and the FMV is unimpressive, but Squaresoft had absolutely hit the nail on the head with it's world design. Melodically, the sound is wonderful, and I would argue tied as the best in the series with FFX, BUT the technical aspects of the sound is horrid. MIDI? On a CD? And those gunshots are laughable.
But there is no denying that Final Fantasy VII is a kick to play through. The story is so convoluted and impossible to understand clearly that it's just fun trying to summarize it (impossible, by the way--but not for any good reasons).
For a really good PSOne Squaresoft game, go with Chrono Cross. FFVII will give you some enjoyment until then.
