What are you prepared to do?
Pros:
Very enjoyable game
Pretty good graphics(despite eyes are white)
5 fatalities a pop, more than mortal combat
Very good rap tracks
good voice acting in FMVs
Devistating combos that can dish out mad damage
Rage meter definitly helps
Suprisingly good for a game that didn't get much praise from sites
Cons:
Story mode (especially in China) gets real repetitive
Some fatalities stink(like decks first fatalitiy)
Ghost, and Masta don't support their voices
I never herd of this game, until my brother brought it over, and I was hooked.  I got everything for him, and yet he didn't even let me borrow the game(One stingy brother)  But I got it not far after, and now I'm still enjoying it from time to time.  If you love mortal Combat, or like wu-tang, this is sure not to dissapoint.
Final Words:This game is definitly a game that lives up to not only the wu-tang name, but a mortal kombat, with a Tekken style looking game.  And that's what also cought my eye as well.
Peace
