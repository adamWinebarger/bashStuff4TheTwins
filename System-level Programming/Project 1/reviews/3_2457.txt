Star Wars RACER features excellent graphics. You get your choice of pods and their corresponding character. During the race, the graphics are very smooth and the controls are very easy to master. During the first few races, expect to break lap records in finish first. In the harder levels, expect nose-to-nose finishes. The only drawback is that the game is pretty much the same from start to finish. This is a must have and still today, it will show off your graphics card!
