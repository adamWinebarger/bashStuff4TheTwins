I've conquered hundreds of video games, but unless you have serious amounts of free time on your hand the tomb raider series is not for you.  I especially don't like having to get a hint guide to progress through a  game.  The first tomb raider was difficult, but not unreasonably so, the  puzzles made sense.  The second one introduced a troubling trend of hiding  the solution to puzzles in nonsensical places, and forcing a player to  backtrack and turn up the brightness constantly.  In this game it is  virtually impossible to figure out swiftly where you need to go or what you  have to do.  With larger levels come an increasingly frustrating inability  to simply figure out what you're trying to do in that particular level.  I  finally gave up after defeating two areas.  I refused to buy the hint  guide, but after flipping through it I was enraged at how impossible the  programmers made it to find the extra weapons and ammo.  The game is  tough enough already without having to defeat levels with just your pistols  if you don't buy the hint guide.
Why the hell can't they just make the  game fun?  the first one was just about right.  I'll never have the amount  of free time necessary to enjoy this series, which I actually love.  I have  more fun just wandering around and jumping then trying to defeat needlessly  obtuse puzzles.  The only area really up to first tomb raider standards are  is the south american levels with the giant statues.  ARGH.
