I got this game because it was supposed to be the best game ever. It's not. The main flaw is the overhead perspective. The overhead camera angle limits your view of the surroundings to a huge degree. You end up relying on a radar in the upper corner of the screen to navigate the levels. This is simply wrong. If I am supposed to be the character, then I should be able to see what the character sees. The game does allow you to go into 1st person view, but you can't do anything other than look around--not even move. This control system is far too limiting, especially when much of the game is sneaking around, which requires you to really see your surroundings. The aiming system is dumb too: you hold down the fire button to aim, then release the button to fire. This means there is no way to aim and then not shoot, and no way to hold onto a target between shots. I also tired of the interuptions in game play by all the cut scenes and radio conversation with home base. Get Syphon Filter instead-not as in depth or graphically detailed, but way better game play.
