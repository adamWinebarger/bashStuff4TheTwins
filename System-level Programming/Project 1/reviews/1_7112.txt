As with the Final Fantasy Origins disc for sale through Amazon, this is a bootleg disc. It contains silver backed discs versus trademark original black PlayStation discs. I should have known better for the price and condition. These are considered some of the greatest Final Fantasy titles for crying out loud!

Everything still works. The case is complete with (bootlegged) manual, and the games play fine in my OG PSX console, but I didn't want no dirty, illegal software when I paid for this so it gets one star.  Do yourself a favor and get a good used copy, but be careful, these pirated copies have proliferated Amazon's used store and eBay.

Look for the Squaresoft logo and black discs!!

Amazon, you need to pull these from your storefront!!!!
