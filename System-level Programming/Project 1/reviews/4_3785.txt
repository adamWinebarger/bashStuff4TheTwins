In Res Evil two, you had two discs of stuff to get done, one playing as Leon, and the other as Claire. In this one, you are Jill Valentine, and you can't really pick anyone else.
Still, the weapons in this game improved a great deal! You get the standard pistol, shotgun etc... but there are improved bullets to be made, more powerful shotguns/pistols, M-16 rifles, and so much more! Also, each time you defeat Nemesis in the hard level, he gives you a peice to a gun you won't find in the game, or something cool like that. Then there is the Mercenaries game after you beat the actual game through the first time. Mercenaries is a little bit redundant, but if you keep at it, you can buy unlimited ammo, start with automatic weapons and more! This means any gun you find in the game never runs dry, and believe me, the first time through the hard level, you're going to WANT more ammo! Besides, as you obtain more powerful weapons, you can swat Nemesis like a pesky fly with the missile launcher, mow down Zombies with the Magnum, or mass-attack with the mini gun.
The story is pretty much "get outta Dodge", but the added affects of meeting various survivors here and there is kind of cool (although some of the survivors are not always the good guys). Also, each time you beat the game, you get another peice of what is happening with Leon, Claire, Barry, and more!
I'd suggest this one, I played it for a solid month, even after I beat it (and I'm still playing)!
