Amazing value. I cannot believe this set is available for this price. Everything from the packaging to the quality of the paper is stellar.  This set feels like it was put together with care in mind. Also worth noting is the fact that the Ocarina of Time guide can only be found in this set. Only criticism I have is that the cloth maps were not included for  Twilight Princess and Wind Waker. Still, Im very happy with my purchase.
