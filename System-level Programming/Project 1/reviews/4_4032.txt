Sonic Adventure
When the Dreamcast first came out, this was one of the games you had to have. Sonic, being the cornerstone of Sega, was expected to be Sega's&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Super-Mario-64/dp/B00000F1GM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Super Mario 64</a>. Although it failed to meet that expectation, they did create a fairly fun game. I still think if you own a Dreamcast that this needs to be in your collection. If you don't own a Dreamcast, there is no reason to find one just for this game.

Graphics- 7/10
At the time these were really good graphics. They couldn't stand up to&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Soul-Calibur/dp/B00000K125/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Soul Calibur</a>, but it was still solid. Many problems lie within the graphics though. The level design is poor. The Adventure Zones are small and yet have a loading screen every time you walk through a door. Action Zones are sometimes better, like in Twinkle Park, but not usually. The camera has all kinds of problems. You will become annoyed very quickly if you find yourself in a small room and the camera is caught. The graphics are smooth and have some good details, but overall the level design is just ugly.

Story- 8.5/10
This is probably the best aspect of the game. In this game you don't just play as Sonic, you can play as five other characters: Tails, Amy, Knuckles, E-102, and Big. You can't just pick whoever you want, you have to start as Sonic and earn other characters. One you earn another character, you can go play through their stories. You earn other characters by meeting them in the game. So, the stories sort of intertwine. You never wonder what other characters were doing because you can play as them all and figure out. Other than that, the story is you basic Sonic story. Dr. Robotnik is causes havoc and you have to stop him. It's just interesting because it shows how the story affects all the characters in the game.

Sound- 6/10
Your basic Sonic sounds. You have some decent music here and there, and that stupid jump noise. A lot of music is reused over and over again. The sound in this game is just above average and has nothing special about it.

Gameplay- 6.5/10
Although they added in the ability to play as different characters, this is still a very bad gameplay wise game. As Sonic, you go through the longest portions of the game. Sonic's story is probably one of the most interesting and well worth your time. Tails consists of you racing Sonic to try to prove that you are just as good as him. This is fairly fun, but you are practically just replaying a portion of Sonic's game. As Amy you will be protecting a bird. You have a hammer as a weapon, which is at least a little interesting. As Big you have to fish to find your friend, Froggy. This is a change in pace, but it is poorly done and very annoying trying to catch that stupid frog. Knuckles can glide and climb on things. As Knuckles you are looking for pieces of crystals. This is fun, but far too easy. As E-102 you are working for Robotnik for most of the game, but you also get to play the aftermath. He has probably the easiest game in the entire game as he uses a gun.

Difficulty- 2/10 (Note- This is how much I like the difficulty)
The game is either extremely easy, or it is annoying like Big's is. The game can be flown through. The only thing that keeps the length up is the multiple characters. Even with all the characters, this game can easily be beat within 2 days. I know the game is based for a younger audience, but it could offer a little challenge. The only hard part in the entire game is the final 7th character you unlock.

Overall- 6.5/10
This game is a fun game worth playing; it just fails at being a truly entertaining experience. If you own a Dreamcast, I suggest you buy this game. If you don't own a Dreamcast, forget you even read this review and go buy something awesome.
