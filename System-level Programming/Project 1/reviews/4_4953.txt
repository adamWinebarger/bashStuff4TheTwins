B-17 is a great game.  I would give it 5-Stars instead of the 4 I did, but for the normal person(not a nutty a GAMER like me and others)it takes time.  I mean - Time to learn to fly, figure out what to do with the crew-10 men, and TIME to learn every position.  That said: buy it, sit down, have a few and learn to have a good TIME at your computer!!!
