I really enjoy playing this game.  In the beginning I found it a bit confusing compared to Age of Empires (an absolutely excellent game), so I didn't really like it.  I eventually became better and now I find it very fun to play.  It is set in the future and you can have your choice of who/what you are.  There are some really cool aliens.  Take a look at this game.  It's great for someone who likes stragedy!  Planning your next move against the enemy.  Highly recommended!!
