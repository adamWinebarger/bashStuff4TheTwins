I bought this to play FFVI, so I never played FF V. This remake just sucked....for one thing, the sound effects were screwed up, as well as some slowdown. Another gripe is no extras except a couple cutscenes and a monster encyclopedia. I guess I was expecting more cutscenes  and a lot of other extras

skip this and just get an emulator and play the original SNES version
