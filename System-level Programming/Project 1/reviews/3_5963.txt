Defenately not the best Mortal Kombat game. Although not pityfully awful like stated in other reviews, the game isn't extremely fun. I spent hours tring to beat the game, and when I finally did I was very diapointed. The graphics weren't bad, at least not too much. The story of the game (isn't great either).
But, it's the link that shows what went on between the Shao Kahn tournaments and Mortal Kombat 4. However, the game plot also contradicts few things to the typical Mortal Kombat legacy. For example, aren't the four elemental gods supposed to be good? Then why are they on the bad guy's side? So in the end, the game is somewhat fun, and long lasting, but is it really worth your money, to me it was, and at times it was, but the final decision is up to you, you decide, I 'll just give you a little advice: don't get it.
