This product is in perfect quality. The screen is in perfect condition, though not as bright as it seems in the product picture. The atomic purple coloring is also not as vibrant, but that is not the companies fault. That is simply how Nintendo made them. I'm a pleasantly pleased with this product and will be purchasing from this selller again.
