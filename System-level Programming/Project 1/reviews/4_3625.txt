Nope.... the title of my review IS NOT misleading, yes DC had a much better and more complete plot than either RE1 or RE3. RE2, not quiet as the scientific aura of the game sucks you in. Anyway, to get started, Regina and her fellow comrades are out on Ibis Island in search of a man by the name of Professor Kirk. Apparently he's got this new "Third Energy Experiment" which he is conducting.. I won't spoil as to what is behind this experiment as it'll ruin the gaming experience. The gameplay is similar to that of RE2/3 but instead of zombies, you face dinosaurs. You will NOT be dissapointed. I must say Shinji Mikami has good taste when it comes to creating a game with a very good storyline.

Gameplay:9/10(Exactly like RE except you have 3D graphics instead of 2D)
Story:8.5/10(It's very rare for a game to earn a good rating in this area)
Replay Value:8/10 Hey, you have three different endings and replaying it gives a chance to experience the different possbilities.
Suspense: 9/10 This game is easily a victor in this department. My hats off to Shinji for making this game more suspensful unlike its sucessor, DC2.
