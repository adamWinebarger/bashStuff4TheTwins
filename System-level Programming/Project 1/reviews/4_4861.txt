The reason I'm still getting PSX games is nostalgia but also because there are few games these days that match the awesomeness of the wipeout franchise. Having played this on both PSX, PSP and PS3 I must say the wipeout games never disappoint. The techno soundtracks are a good match for this type of racing game. If you are like me it will not matter if you get this or the more recent versions, it will be as fun!
