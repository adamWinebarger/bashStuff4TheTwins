I am totally at a loss for this game.  On one hand it has so many original idea's in terms of both plot and gameplay (And has the closest thing to a sim dating game we'll probably ever see), but the way you actually play it leaves me at a loss for words.  It's not that the battle system makes no sense, or is bad even, it's the leveling up that confuses me.  You don't get stronger when you level up.  Your defense gets weaker when you level up.  You get more health but you seem to loose more health at the same token too.  I'm am at a loss that the creaters of this game could make so many good idea's and make them so poor because they can't figure out commen sense when it comes to leveling up.
If you want an RPG that's original get this...just don't exspect to get anywhere with it.
