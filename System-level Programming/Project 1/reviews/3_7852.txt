well I've had this game for close to three years. a friend left it at my house and shortly after he moved I found it under some stuff. So, I decided to try it out. Since then i've played it about 5 or 6 times, and to tell you the truth, it's not that bad of a game. the original idea of transforming your characters into ferocious beasts is a step ahead of the other fighting simulators out there (tekken, battle arena toshinden, tobal) and is original in it's own right. However, I do think that some of the gameplay is slow and blocky, although the characters are well designed. The difficulty is a bit harder than your usual fighting game, but that leaves the player desiring more gameplay rather than beating it the first time with nothing else to strive for. The art section is interesting, and the characters are displayed wonderfully. One thing I'd like to point out though--I really thought Fox was cute...until I found out it was a GUY. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a pervert who obsesses over video game girls, but I thought fox looked alot cuter than alice...but when I found out that it was a guy...haha I just about smacked myself. So anyways, to sum it all up, this game is a good kick for 2 player or playing it once in awhile, but as far as total replay value goes, it's not all THAT great. I recently sold mine ot somebody because I never played it, and it just sat around. I figured with the extra money I could use it to invest in some shiny new guitar effects pedals or something of the like. so, having spent 5 minutes of my time, I hope I helped somebody in making their decision whether to buy this game or not.  -Jared
