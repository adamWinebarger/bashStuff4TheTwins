I love this game. Back when I was eight years old I got this on PC and played this game until it became muscle memory. Playing this on PS1 is even more fun thanks to the benefit of a controller.

I looked up reviews for this game and I was surprised to see it blasted by many reviewers. They claimed it was too easy or too hard and painfully awkward to control. That is not the case. It is actually a very smart game that teaches you how to play in the first level without a single word of dialog or a single segment of text.

My four year old cousin can pick this up and play it easily thanks to the intuitive design. The music is fun. The controls are smooth. And the game is just simply fun.

There is little completion bonus with only challenge maps and an extra boss as a reward. But the levels are fun an memorable. The volcanic levels, snow levels, desert levels, and castle levels are extremely fun and exciting.

Get this for young gamers or people who like playing platformer games.
