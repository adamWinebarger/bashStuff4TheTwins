Final Fantasy 7 is the best FF I have yet to play.  I have played 8 and 9 also, but 7 has the best music, battle system, and junctioning system of all of them (not to mention the greatest story-line in the history of everything!).  Besides a couple of translation errors, this game is perfect.  I was introduced to Final Fantasy 7, 3 years ago, and I still do not know many things about it. So if your looking for a long challenge ahead of you, but not a challenge so hard that it sucks the fun out of it, you should buy this game, and before they stop selling it.
