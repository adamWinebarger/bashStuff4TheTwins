...BR>This game, more than any other for the Nintendo 64, is what will come to mind when most ppl think of the N64.  Mainly because, this was one of the first shooter games to require the gamer to use his brain to solve puzzles and get thru the nasty surprises the game will throw at you.  Not following the bloodlust of previous first shooter games like Doom, Heretic, Turok, etc. this game is in a class of its own.  It gives you objectives to complete however, unlike Perfect Dark it adds to the challenge by giving you deadly surprises that are NOT mentioned in the mission breifing, these will make at least restart a few levels over and over until you figure it out for yourself.  Its a much better game than any other First shooter Ive played since it stresses Stealthy behavior, and intelligence on the part of the player to succeed.
Granted it does not have the extras in the Multiplayer section that Perfect Dark has but it has an element of challenge that Perfect Dark will never have.
