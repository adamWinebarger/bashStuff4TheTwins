Ok , just like everyone sez, this IS one of the best games ever made and you SHOULD buy it immediately.  But it does have some flaws.
 First of all, a lot of the weopons in this game i don't like. There is only one machine gun ...only one shotgun ..one pistol , etc.  Cmon, wheres the variety??
Second, the Team Fortress add on that comes with this game really sucks. It is no where near as good as counterstrike.
Anyways,  Buy Half Life and download Counterstrike for free of the net.
