Even though this game IS fun, I must admit, this game is REALY old, especially now that the newest MK game vs. DC Comics is coming out this fall. This game is pretty fun, like I said before, but the game is almost impossible to beat and I think I only beat the game a couple times. If you want something challenging that's classic, get this game.
