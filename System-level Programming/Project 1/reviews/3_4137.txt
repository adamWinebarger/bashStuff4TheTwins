In the varied and overcrowded plateu of first-person games, it's always  nice to see someone try to break away from the mold, but unfortately,  System Shock 2 comes a little too late.  Having missed the chance to beat  Half-Life to the punch, this game is a fun play, but one best borrowed from  a friend.
