I can't even begin to explain how much I love this game as well as the second Crash Bandicoot game(I haven't played the first game yet) because they are so much fun with lots and lots of humorous levels and disasters.
Bandicoot is a marsupial on a muey dangerouso quest to collect 25 crystals and 25 relics in a quest to stop Dr. Neo Cortex and Aku Akus evil twin Uka Uka's quest to take over the world.
There are so many things that make this game so addictive,.
1. The music. It's so hilarious
2. The complex levels
3. The graphics are so awesome
4. The way Crash dies (I.E. falling off screen and his shoes fly up and fall back down, being sucked into a giant spinning vase and the lid closes on top of it)
By God to really even explain how great this game really is is difficult for me.
Like Sonic the Hedgehog was for Sega, and Mario was for Nintendo, Crash is for the Playstation.
In this day and age of excessively bloody and violent video games the Crash Bandicoot series is a great sigh of relief. I tend to enjoy sillier cartoonish games like this. I will never tire of this game.
