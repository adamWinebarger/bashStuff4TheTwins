It's obviously not the best console, but since I've bought it I've had a ton of fun with it and consider it a great collectors console. The Sega Dreamcast has a lot of great games like Sonic Adventure, Sonic Adventure 2, Soul Caliber, Jet Grind Radio, Blue Stinger, and Carrier to name a few of my favorites. A Dreamcast is definitely worth picking up online or at your local store.
