A used original Nintendo brand N64 controllers is far superior than a new aftermarket brand controller. I've tried a few aftermarket brands and they end up falling apart (literally) are otherwise breaking while my used original Nintendo brand controllers still function. The main weak point of any original Nintendo brand N64 controller is the stick. This is almost always the part to fail, so much that sellers know a "firm stick" is a selling point. There is no question as to whether this will happen, but how long until you have to fix it... No worries, when your stick gets loose, buy a stick replacement. Replacing the stick is far less troublesome then some of the issues I've faced with the aftermarket brands. Completely satisfied with this purchase.
