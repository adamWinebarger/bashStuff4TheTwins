Anyone who has ever played a flight sim can tell this is not like A10-warthog just by reading the info on the game. This is an arcade type game with some sim stuff add to make it sell more and be kind of fun and fast to play. Sometimes we all just want to blow the (blank) out of things and unwind. This is fairly well made and the graphics are ok for what it is(a game).
If you want a real flight sim this is not it. If you just want to get online and have some fun with others for a while this is it. The target aircraft can do hard right and left turns that would take the wings of any aircraft and thats not right but this is a game and not a sim. This was made sometime ago and graphics have come along way but it is ok for it's time.
You will not have any issues installing this or running this game on most systems with a gtx460 or better. You can max out all setting with one evga gtx560ti 2gb video card. The install dose take some time to get done and it will update for you when you run the sim the first time. This all takes 30min or so counting the install of the game.
It is what it is and thats a game not a flight sim but it is fun to play a few hours now and then.
I have a solid system and have had no issues running this at all.
If you are looking for a real flight sim that has ture reallistic flight of the aircraft and working cockpits, this is not for you. Try A10-warthog or wings over europe or wings over vietnam or IL-2. These are flight sims and run well on any solid sysetm with xp or windows 7 running.
