I wasn't quite sure what to expect when I picked this game up. At first I was struck as to how much it resembles WARCRAFT (ORCS VS. HUMANS). Most of the level advancing, character animation and general game play is almost identical. At then end of the day, the purpose is to beat your enemy by advancing through civilizations and either conquering them, retrieving artifacts or constructing a wonder. The game is addictive, especially at the higher levels. If you can, try the multiplayer versions. There's nothing quite like playing against someone else. There are a few annoying little things. You can lose your people behind buildings and, in some cases, they get lost if sent on a roundabout route to their destinations. However, still a fun game and highly recommended.
