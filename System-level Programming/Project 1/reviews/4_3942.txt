I read a lot of reviews on this game before buying it, so maybe my expectations were a little high.  The graphics here are really not that different in quality from X-Men MA2 (actually, the backgrounds in X-Men are more dynamic).  The fighting is good here though, and the characters really do have distinct fighting styles that give you quite the challenge in Arcade mode. They also tend to defend themselves more here, so your every kick or punch won't connect like you want it to.  If you're buying for a good fighting game, then you shouldn't be disappointed...but if you're buying expecting graphics that are unlike anything you've ever seen before, you may be.
