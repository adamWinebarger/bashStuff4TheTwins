Let me clear something up: This is by no means a bad game. It is decently enjoyable. However, the reason for the lower score is mostly due to my disappointment with this game. Everybody built it up as the "Best Mario Kart Game". However, my experience with it made it turn out to be my least favorite in the series. It doesn't play fantastic, the graphics are ok, and the game is fairly smooth. However, this game is far from deserving of the unreasonable prices and high praise it gets.
