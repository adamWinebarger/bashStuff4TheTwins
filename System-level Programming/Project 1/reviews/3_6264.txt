A lot of elements in FFVIII are pretty creative.  The storyline, as in most FF games, is award-winning good.  The graphics are good for its time, and the customizing system (Junctioning) is really innovative and simple to use.  Music is really nice also, as well as the sound.  But still, not among Square's best Final Fantasy games.  This game tends to be almost too easy through the story, but getting some things is really hard (e.g. getting Malboro Tentacles for Doomtrain.  I really hate Malboros!!!).  Also, junctioning makes the game even easier than it normally is, which makes it less and less fun to play, and the card game is addicting, but silly.  But nevertheless a good game.
