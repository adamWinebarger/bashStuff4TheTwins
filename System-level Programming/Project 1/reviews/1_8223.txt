So after the success of Batman Returns, there would be a movie adaption of Batman Forever.  The graphics looked interesting.  Almost a next gen feel for the SNES.  And it would be a brawler.  So how could it go wrong?  Well first off, it feels like they are trying to rip off Mortal Kombat.
But the worst sin is that the controls are horrendous.  They are so frustrating.  I remember spending most of my time mashing buttons just trying to get my grappling hook to work.  Still brings up bad memories all these years later!
The story is fine.  And it is a good challenge in game play.  But its never a good game where the main challenge is the broken controls.  Game better left lost to the sands of time.
