Demolition Racer is quite similar to the Destruction Derby games  previously released for the Playstation.  Its different modes of play makes  this game stand out from the previous DD games and gives Demolition Racer  the ultimate replay value.
Each car handles differently but seems to  control near perfectly when using Dual Shock Analog Controller.  Your  overall objectives in the league modes is to finish first and to score the  most points.  What can be better than slamming into the car in front of you  and taking them out of the race?  You will find yourself trying to score  more and more points by wiping out the competion.  This is a very fun  aspect of this game.
There are a nice variety of tracks and cars to chose  from and the different modes of play breaks up any repetition.  The Arena  mode in this game is nearly identical to the Bowl levels in Destruction  Derby 1 and 2, however instead of getting to visit the Bowl at the end of  each level, the entire levels of play have you moving from one bowl to the  next (if you survive.) It is a really great mode of play, trying to survive  and destroy the competition in a rounded bowl arena.  Its basically kill or  be killed.
Overall, Demolition Racer is a blast to play and the replay  value will have you coming back for more.  Its a fun game, and at 20 bucks,  its a steal!
