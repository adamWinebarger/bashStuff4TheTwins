Even though this game has a HUGE map, great graphics, and everything you need to make the perfect RPG, it still stinks. I know this may sound crazy but it really isint. The main problem is combat. You select where you want to attack (high, medium, or low) and the computer does the rest. Also you have to pay 10.00 a month to play it. There are many other reasons why this game is absolutely no fun to play but trust me it is no fun at all. Remember, great graphics does not make a game, gameplay does.
