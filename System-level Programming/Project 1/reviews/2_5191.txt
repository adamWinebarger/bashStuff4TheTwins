Ok, by reading the reviews of the people here, I can see someone has figured this game out.  I bought it not realizing it had missions where you had to do certian thing at certain times.  I thought this was going to more of a graphics rich version of Dune 2000 or Tiberian Sun...was I dissapointed.
It takes forever just to get to play a mission.  The mission starts loading up and someone starts talking, I guess giving a little story to the mission you are about to play.  But, I can see that it's all loaded up within a few seconds, but the person just keeps talking.  I can't get it to skip past that so I can go ahead a play.  This is very frustrating.  In a nutshell, I stopped trying to figure it out and went on to buy another game to play.  Get something else, this sucks.
