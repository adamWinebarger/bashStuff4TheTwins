I sadly remember the day when this game was released.  I had waited long enough, and finally I had the game in my hands.  I remember being so excited until about 1 hour into the game.  It was then that I realized that  this game was terrible.
The graphics were nice, and the cut scenes were  above average.  The voices sounded good, and the combat was a little fast,  but adequate.
But I wasn't having fun.  I realized that the game was  pretty deep, and dwelling deeper into the game's cool storyline would  require more of the bad AI, terrible - I mean HORRIBLE combat system, and  scrappy mouse driven interface.  I couldn't take it anymore.  I wished I  could just watch the game instead of play it, then I would of been  happy.
I did what I had to do, and finally uninstalled it.  I thought of  all the money I spent, and went to find another game.  What a tradgedy that  a game with that much potential had to be ruined by an obvious rushed  product.  If your a gamer who likes fast action and addicting gameplay,  then go buy Icewind Dale or Diablo 2, not this game.
