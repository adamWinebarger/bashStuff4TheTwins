There are a few "Dead Ends" in this game.  (That's funny if you've played it.)  What I mean is that you find yourself cornered by the madman Scissorman and killed.  However, the point of the game is to evade the killer while picking up clues that will reveal his identity.  Is he just a sick human being?  Or is Scissorman some supernatural evil?

  Sometimes the game will have you begging for a save point where you must successfully run from Scissorman several times before you can escape or find help.

  Overall, the game will probably satisfy people who enjoy thrillers and games like Resident Evil or Fatal Frame.  It is a race to find the critical clues.  However, it is a cursor-moving game.  You do not have free three-D movement as I thought you would.  Rather, you use a cursor for movement.

  It's not that bad a game.
