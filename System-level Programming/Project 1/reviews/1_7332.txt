THIS IS THE VERSION OF MORTAL KOMBAT 3 THAT YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY AVOID. THIS GAME WAS HORRIBLE AND IT MAKES THE SUPER NINTENDO VERSION LOOK LIKE A GOOD GAME IN COMPARISON. THE GRAPHICS ARE AWFUL, THE MUSIC IS ANNOYING HERE, THE CONTROLS ARE BAD, AND UNLESS YOU HAVE A 6 BUTTON CONTROLLER FOR THE SEGA GENESIS, YOU CAN'T DO MUCH OF ANYTHING!!! THIS IS A MAJOR DISSAPOINTMENT TO THOSE THAT HAVE THIS GAME ON GENESIS. AVOID THIS VERSION AT ALL COSTS. THIS IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME. THIS VERSION JUST RUINS THIS SOMEWHAT DECENT SEQUEL.
