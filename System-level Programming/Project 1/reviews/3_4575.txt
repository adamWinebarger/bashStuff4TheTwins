I'm surprised that with so many constructive and positive comments, that Sierra hasn't commissioned another Gabriel Knight game. This is the only one I've played, so I can't compare this game to the first two in the series.
I think the decision to use the Quake 2 game engine was, in hindsight, a poor one. The Quake 2 engine always uses excessive browns in its color palette. This is particularly evident in the outdoor scenes - particularly in areas like Montreaux's Mansion. The mountains look way too blockly and polygonal to be real.
Another odd 'glitch' was that the town was totally deserted, and even with the 3D-engine it still seemed a bit...small. We didn't see any people walking in the streets, even in the daytime. The only inhabitants either stayed at the hotel or lived in the church. This is a totally unrealistic approach that marred the game.
But at the time the game was made, what other 3D-engine was available? ....conclusion, I think Gabriel Knight 3 was a game that could've been great. In the end, the two parts that let it down were the sad ending, and the game engine that was used. I hope Ms. Jensen writes a GK4...although I very much doubt it.
