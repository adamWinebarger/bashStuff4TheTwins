I'm just sick of reading reviews that don't show mario kart of what it really did but i'll tell you what it really did.
Mario Kart was one of the first games out for nintendo and the first game that started series of mario games for n64.  Such as Mario party 1,2, and 3 also adventure games like super mario 64 etc.  and many more to come.
Mario Kart was so good because the tracks were so detailed yet not so detailed that the whole game is messed up because of it.  And it's just so addicting because it's easy gameplay.  And you cant say nutin bad about it.
So if your looking for a good game for n64 that was better than any other mario game in history besides melee.  This is the game.
