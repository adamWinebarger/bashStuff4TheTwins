this game is pretty fun.  The graphics are decent, the sound is also above average.  This game is at its best when 4 human players play in a 4 player multiplayer game.  Games are always high scoring when playing with your friends.  This game is a great game if you always have people who will play with you.  But when playing alone this game sucks.  Sure smacking the computer is fun a while, but theres no one to smack talk.  The novelty of hard hits wears off fast.  Also the no pass inerference rule gets cheap.  On easy mode, the computer gets whooped every time beacause they never pass interference, but on hard, the computer will use it on every play, making it frustrating, because it will be so freaking hard to cathc a pass.  For the person with no friends this game may not be right for you.  First of all this game has no season mode for 1 player.  its just arcade mode.  Secondly, there are no things to keep you busy like creat-a-player ( i believe there is create a play, but i would rather have more fun creating players ).  so get this game if you have lots of friends or if there are always people to play with you. if you don't have friends or you are a only child, stick with NFL2k for all you solo gamers.
