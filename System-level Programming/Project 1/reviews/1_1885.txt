Compare this to super mario, crash bandicoot and dark souls, this game looks too easy and boring.
The bosses are a joke. A laughing stock next to crash, the levels prove to be a bigger challenge with enemies and hidden gems.
The graphics and music are terrible too.
Id say forget the first three and star with: enter the dragonfly and legend series
