I am yet to find an Electronic Arts game that does not provide me with hours of entertainment. However, with all the "Theme Park" simulation games on the web, I advise you to chose the Roller Coaster Tycoon Games.
Why do I advise you to chose the Tycoon games?
*The Roller Coaster Tycoon has better, more realistic, and more playable graphics. Of course if you are one who enjoys the cartoonist preception of the characters, this will be an okay feature. However, I recommend looking for screenshots of this game to see if you like the graphics.
*Sim Theme Park clogs up your computer system much worse than Roller Coaster Tycoon, so unless you have a pretty fast system, be prepared for some freezing, where with Roller Coaster Tycoon you can pretty much play with out annoying slowness.
*Sim Theme Park gets boring fast with its last of great rides, themes.
Don't get me wrong I love simulation games. (They are my ultimate favorite) But I sincerely recommend the Roller Coaster Tyoon Games. They cost less, have better reviews, better graphics (in my opinion) and more rides and themes, and in addition, they don't freeze up your older computer as much as Sim Theme Park.
As with most people reviewing this game, check out the Roller Coaster Tycoon games, I guarentee you cannot be disappoint with them.
