This game is a hoot. Taking the original's over-the-top Evil to a new level in graphics and a far improved first-person engine, it basically polishes and refines the gameplay of DK1.
You control a variety of  minions (from Goblins to Dark Angels) with a variety of wants and needs,  all toward the larger purpose of wiping out the good in the world. And a  simpering, pompous sort of good it is, full of bloated speech and poseurs  who care at least as much about how good they look as they do about  fighting evil.
Much like Bullfrog's Populous: The Beginning, however,  there isn't a lot of game here. It's more of a puzzle game than a real-time  strategy game, and once you solve the puzzle, actually enacting it is  usually pretty straightforward. Like P:TB, the beginning levels are easily  won by accident, making this a good game for children if you don't mind the  "suggestive content". (Actually, all there is is that the Pain  Mistresses enjoy being tortured.  But we're not talking about "Soldier  of Fortune" violence or "Panty Raider" sexuality,  here.)
Anyway, the aesthetics of it, the humor, the "My Pet  Dungeon" feature, and the overall attention to detail make it a hoot  to explore, even if it doesn't have a lot of depth, particularly for casual  gamers with a dark sense of humor.
