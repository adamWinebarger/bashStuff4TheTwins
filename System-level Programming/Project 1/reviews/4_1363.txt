The original Grand Theft Auto was a classic for the PC, but it's gleefully unabashed violence, simple graphics, dark humor, and addictive gameplay garnered the game much appeal and controversy.  Eventually Take 2 Interactive (now they're called Rockstar) published GTA on as many systems as it could: the PS1, Dreamcast, and even the Game Boy Color.  These days anyone and everyone are GTA nuts, but only when it comes to GTA 3 or Vice City.  The original GTA may seem simple enough, but it is undeniably fun for the most part, no matter how simplistic the graphics seem.  The missions can get rather tedious, and the fact you can't save your progress in game (a problem which would be corrected in GTA 3), and eventually you'll lose interest, but for the most part the original GTA is still loads of fun.  Those who have only played GTA 3 or Vice City will not like this original installment, but it's a great ride while it lasts.
