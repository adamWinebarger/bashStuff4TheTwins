People, i wrote this review to warn whatever of you out there want to buy this game. This will make even the most die hard game fans throw their playstations out the window. The games has most of the characters(whoopie...)which are represented with sub bar graphics and pitifull level desighn amoungst other things.the games boring. I rented it and it literally got old after 5 minutes of gameplay. If there is one redemable factor about this game its that you can laugh at how utterly stupid it is. Avoid this nerf dung at all costs.
