This is my first review I've done of a video game. Body Harvest is a game that's very much fun to play. Although I read through the instruction booklet, this game SEEMS tough to figure out as to what to do next. It's almost like having your -own- Johnny Quest cartoon to play. Although you get just one life in your player (sort of a futuristic-like space warrior), you get plenty of chances to re-juice his power. The graphics, in MY opinion are good even though I've heard others quoting that they didn't care for them. Also enjoy the music that starts up whenever the aliens start coming in for the kill. An hour can easily pass by when you play Body Harvest. A good game to own.
