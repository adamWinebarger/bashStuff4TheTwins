Thanks to Nintendo's bright idea to make a system and double the graphics from the 32-bit Sega Saturn and Playstation systems, we get stuck with one of the worst sytems out there.  True Sega Saturn had lousy 3D graphics and  bad third-party support, no one can deniy the fact it had some great games  on it.  And I hate Playstation, but because they shaped their graphics just  right the games somehow came out looking better than N64.  Not only do we  get a really cheesy system, they also had to turn many classic 2D games and  turn them into horrible 3D games (Like Earthworm Jim 3D, Zelda, Donkey Kong  64, Kirby, Rayman 2, and so much more...)!  Plus the controll drove me  bonkers the way they controll it.  Sometimes the controll's bother me so  much I have to stop playing the game.  Plus because the games are in  cartriges (Lousy sound and space because of this) they cost [a lot]  and the games are usally short and don't last more than a couple of hours  before you're finished with the game.  And this is from someone who has  loved all their other systems they made.  Which is why I was crying after I  played this thing (I still think once was too painfull) at a friends house.  Complete waste of money.  I do not recomend.  Let's hope the Nintendo Cube  Box turns out better than this piece of trash.
