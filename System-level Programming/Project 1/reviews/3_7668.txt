A somewhat entertaining video game to pull out of your cartridge stack to play and help kill thirty, maybe forty-five minutes with. Out of the twenty Nintendo 64 games that I own, I play this one probably every other month or so. Good graphics to say the least. Also like the music that's played when I put this cartridge in for a race. Sounds very much like that of The Orb or possibly Aphex Twin. Used price for the video game simply cannot be beat.
