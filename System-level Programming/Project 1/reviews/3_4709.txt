I got this game in Dec 1997 and for months me and my best friend did nothing but play it. At the time it seemed so cool and interesting. Today, it seems dated and dull. Weird isn't it? I have AOE2 and it is much better but that too already seems old hat. Even with all the expansion packs available for this game it will never come close to the complexity of the sequel or Age of Mythology. Buy it if you can find it dead cheap tho.
