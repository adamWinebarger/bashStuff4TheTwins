I never got into the hype of Mortal Kombat when it came out in arcades; it was good on arcade while the game lasted and then shipped to SEGA and SNES. Playing it on SNES was pretty boring for me for three reasons. One was the lack of blood. It was probably the most interesting feature of the arcade game. Two was the controller problem. I could never get a lot of moves done the way I asked for. Three was the sheer boredom of it. The game is very one dimensional for me. There is not much to do except memorize the combo moves for each player and then the fatality move. After them, there is nothing else anymore. The tournament is interesting, but once the ladder is climbed to the top, that's it. There isn't much to be said. All in all, Mortal Kombat doesn't cut it for me.
