This is one of the most fun RTS I have ever played. You get to slap around your minions, torture the good guys, and pretty much have a blast being evil. The bile demons are great, and the dark mistresses laughs are creepy. This has a very good sense of dark humor, and I would not recommend it to anyone under 13, or anyone who didn't like dark humor.

We got Evil Genius because we heard it was made by the same people. Evil Genius does NOT hold a candle to this. I still play it a hell of a lot, and I still have fun with it.

The only problems I have is the fact that it tends to have problems with the videos on my computer, pretty much not playing them. And the fact you cannot get multiplayer to work. If the multiplayer worked, there would be no question about giving this game 5 stars.
