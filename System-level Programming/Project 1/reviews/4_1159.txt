There isn't much you can say that is bad with this game. For it's time it  had excellent graphics, excellent game play and sound. This game is truly one in a million that I am sure any person can enjoy, BUT, if your a Zelda fan (and have played all if not most games from the beginning) you'll notice some of the things in OOT are recycled. For example, the Kakariko town music is completely recycled from Zelda: A Link to the Past. In fact this game borrows a lot from Zelda: A Link to the Past, though they do manage to change some things in OOT here and there. Still for what it's worth Zelda: OOT is still a pretty darn good game, though I think the story should have been more original.
