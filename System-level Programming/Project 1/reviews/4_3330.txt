Although the graphics aren't as good as one would expect, the characters are very well done.  Espeically Sephiroth, he seems to be the very essence of evil with the tricks he pulls of in the game.  Many of the mini games are great my only beef with the mini games is that they should of amde the mini-battle game available in the Golden Saucer, also why didn't they put in real voices in the end instead of a postscript?  This was probably to save money so Square wouldnt have to hire voice actors. Although the plot veers off track at times and a few of the program quirks are noticable this games still enjoyable and has a well written story.
