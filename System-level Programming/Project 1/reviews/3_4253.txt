i bought this item at best buy ($12) for use with my NES emulator on my laptop. on the plus side, winXP recognizes this thing right away and you're good to go. however, like a lot of other users, i found the D pad to be a problem. i screwed in the "joystick" thingie and didn't find it made any difference. when i would hold it up or down, it would move in different (diagonal) directions. there were certain moves/functions i could not do in my NES games because of this. so yeah, it's usuable, if you don't need to hold it up or down for more than 1/2 a second. not bad for the price, but if you want full functionality, spend a few more bucks and get something better.
