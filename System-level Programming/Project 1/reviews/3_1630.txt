Now, being a big fan of the hit TV show, I was a little skeptical at first if the game would bring down the integrity of the show, but in the end it did not. South Park isn't a great game, but if you love the show you will definitely enjoy it. You can chose between the four main characters: Kyle, Cartman, Stan, and Kenny. Usually, I pick Cartman because he is the funniest one out of the group and has the best insults. They implemented the same humor they use in their TV show, so the sound samples keep you the most entertained. The point of the game is to save your town from evil turkeys, aliens, toys, clones, and what not. Each level gets kind of repetitive, so the game can be a little boring. There is not much variety to it, but let me reiterate that the voice samples do and will keep you entertained. I give this game credit for the humor, sound, creativity, and graphics, but it lacks in level design and keeping the gamer entertained through other means rather than sound.

Overall, I rate this game a 3 out of 5 because although its cleaver and funny, the actual game play of the game is not that exciting. If I wanted humor, then I could just turn on the show.
