I played this game a long time ago. And I am reviewing it just because i am currently playing GTA 3.
This game reeks with coolness. But me and most other gamers/people want to know how this game managed to get a "Teen" rating. It is just as gory and profained as GTA
Here is how I rate GTA 2
Sound: 10
Graphics: 7
Gameplay: 10
Fun: 10
Difficulty: Easy to Hard
Overall: 8/10 (eight out of ten)
