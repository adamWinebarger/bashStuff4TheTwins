Let me put it like this, if I had to destroy every videogame I own except one, this is the one I wouldn't destroy. This is simply the greatest game ever made. I'm not going to insult this game by trying to describe the storyline or graphics etc.. You have to experience it for yourself. Most helpful thing I can do is tell you how you can get to play this. This game has had dozens of ports. One came on a bonusdisc for Gamecube with "Windwaker" in 2003 and another came in a collectors edition (Master Quest) also for gamecube. If you can't get ahold of one of these, the original for N64, or a ROM you should buy a Wii and download it from the Wii Virtual Console. It will be worth the while.
