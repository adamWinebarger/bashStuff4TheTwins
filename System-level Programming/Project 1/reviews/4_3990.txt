I've been an RPG fan for longer than I can remember, and have played around 70 of em.
Despite the VERY harsh review of gamecritics.com, I thought this game was actually really good. A nice breath of fresh air from the very linear, but nonetheless brilliant, Final Fantasy games.
Hell, sure the story wasn't to die for,but beautiful music,acool combat system, and tons of replay value make this one that every fan of the genre should own.
