Because of the new Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks game coming out, I decided to get all my old MK games out to play. Among them was Mortal Kombat Mythologies: Sub-Zero and this lil gem. Despite what everyone has had to say about the game, Special Forces isn't that bad a game. I mean, if you're any MK fan at all, you're going to get this one just to keep up with the Mortal Kombat mythos. I especially enjoyed the game because it explained alot of the backstory as to how Jax and Sonya first got into MK. I'll admit, however, why they chose Jax to have a starring role in an MK game of his own is beyond me. Not that Jax is a bad character and fighter in the game, he's one of my favorites. It's just there are other more beloved characters from the universe that they could have used. When you think about it, that could be the reason why people didn't make this a big seller, at the time. At any rate, I loved the game. For the first time, it was a Mortal Kombat game that took place in an actual 3-D environment. Fighting is intense with the basic, special, and combination moves.

The only reason why I gave the game 4 stars was because of certain control issues it had. They really hindered my enjoyment getting into the game at times.

Other than that, Mortal Kombat Special Forces is an awesome game. It's a game any respectable Mortal Kombat fan would and should add to their collection.
