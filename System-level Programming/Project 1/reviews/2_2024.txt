Croc: Legend of the Gobbos for the PlayStation should be a very fun game but some key things make it anything but.

Plot: The evil Baron Dante invades the peace loving Gobbo Island the crocodile name Croc tries to save the day by stopping the evil Baron Dante. 8/10

The plot is a high point in this game as a lot of games have bad stories

Sound: This game has a high quality soundtrack and great sound effects. 9/10

Gameplay: to control croc is the bad point, the game bad controls make this game bad enough to skip. 3/10

Overall: This game is OK, but could have been A LOT better. with its cute and cuddly characters to the beautiful islands This game could have been one of the best and well know PlayStation games, BUT, it is only half that. Oh Nostalgia. You betray me again. 6.6 but for GameSpot's score system 6.5/10
