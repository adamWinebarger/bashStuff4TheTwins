OK this game was great.  The time line is very interesting in this game cause it takes place before and into the same time period of RE2.  The added feature of having the main boss chase you the entire game gives the game a interesting challege.  Just when you get all relaxed and are on a roll killing zombies, the music changes and your hear STARS!!!!!!!!!! So now you have a very ugly mean disgusting .....thing chasing from room to room.  Ne ways this game is great a definant must buy for any fan of the series.  And a great game for beginners.
