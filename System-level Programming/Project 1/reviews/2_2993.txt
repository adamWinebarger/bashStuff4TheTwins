What what game I'm describing.  It's old, it's puzzling, and it's a blockbuster game.  It's, you guessed it, Myst.  And that is probably the easiest puzzle you'll get concerning Myst, too.  Since it is a popular game  that was released a quite a long time ago, you've probably heard of it by  now.  I'll just say this one thing:  If you're deaf or impatient, AVOID.  There is a puzzle that involves matching piano tones...heck, even if you're  NOT deaf, it's still quite a puzzler!  But don't fret...you can beat this  game in FIVE MINUTES if you know how, and it can be found in the many game  walk-throughs of the Internet.  After all, with the difficulty of THESE  puzzles, rest assured, you'll be looking for one!
