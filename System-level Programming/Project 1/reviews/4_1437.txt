Better than TR2 for sure. It has some brain taxing levels filled with puzzles, secrets and some enemies. I'm glad to see they have cut back on the enemies and focused on the puzzles and scenery. They have definatly picked some good locations for the game, with brilliant details that are authentic in style. Unfortunatly that is where the authenticity ends.
  The level makers should have done some research on these locations and made them more like they are in real life. OK, I know it's an adventure game that is meant to be fantasy, but I do feel they could have checked things out first.
  Examples; India dosn't have pyrannas(Brazil does), the Ganges dosn't end in a pond, St. Pauls Cathedral looks nothing like that(that must be the worst rendition of it yet), the British Museum is not next to the Lloyds building, and Area 51 is more spacious than that(I saw it on a TV programme, I swear). I won't judge the Pacific levels though, I don't know enough about them. They realy do need to watch their locations more.
Enjoyable game though.
