Don't get me wrong, I'm one of the biggest fans of AoE 1 and Rise of Rome but I didn't like this sequel. First of all, maybe I bought a beta version or something, but why is it that when a Monk moves... abracadabra... he  turns back into our well-known priest from AoE 1?  Is it that the  programmers were too lazy to reprogram the game fully? Again, it could just  be that my version had bugs in it but it is still suspicious and VERY  annoying... this happens with other infantry units as well. Also, I don't  see all that much difference when compared to the original, in fact  whenever they have changed something it is usually for the worse... it now  costs loadsa times more to research new units (I know they are trying to be  realistic but c'mon...) Anyone who's thinking of adding this to their  collection should go for the first two titles, they are definately  better....
