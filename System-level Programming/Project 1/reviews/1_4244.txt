Apparently the way to win this game is to completely disobey your mission objectives.  For instance in the last mission I played (before uninstalling it and throwing it away) I was supposed to pick up a container, protect my  mothership by fending off the attacking tie fighters and fly to a  checkpoint to meet the rebellion.  So I picked up the container and started  killing off tie fighters.  I got them all.  I was killing them as fast as  they were replaced.  Then I got slammed with a dozen missles from all sides  and lost the mission.  I never got notification to go to the next  checkpoint.  The game has a help function after you lose a mission that  gives tips on how to win the mission the next time.  The tip?  Don't  protect the mothership.  The checkpoint won't appear until the mothership  is destroyed.  Besides, if you attack the tie-fighters, then your container  will get destroyed and you won't be able to finish the mission.  That might  be okay, except that the game doesn't tell you that you can't complete the  mission.  Once I just sat there for 10 minutes waiting for something to  happen.  That was boring. After four hours of finding out that I was  supposed to ignore mission objectives and do very little I uninstalled the  game and threw it away.  My only regret is that now I wonder what would  have happened if I had destroyed the mothership myself. This was a definite  waste of money and time.  After my experience with Rebellion, I am now  certain that I will never buy another LucasArts game without playing it  first.
