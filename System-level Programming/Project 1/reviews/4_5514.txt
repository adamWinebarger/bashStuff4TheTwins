First of all, 300 missions sounds like alot, but after playing it for a while you realize that you have completed more than you thought. You are training in a VR world with Solid Snake, and other characters, like Meryl, and the Ninja. Although the Ninja only has 3 missions they are pretty fun. You can use alot of different weapons in different areas. But the reason I gave it only 4 stars is because the first one has a really in depth story and this one is just training. I recommend that you play the first one to really have fun with this one.
