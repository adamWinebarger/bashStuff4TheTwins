With the genre monopolized by the the Final Fantasy series, it is not suprising that this game is absent from most people's top RPG list. To clarify, it is not as good as an FF game, but it is nonetheless enjoyable and fun.
The story is pretty linear, the characters are well developed, and part III offers much of the same fun that was the original BOF for the SNES (which was produced by Squaresoft, not Capcom). The only drawback is the clunky controls, which can be frustrating when you are trying to move down stairs or bend around tight corners. And while the graphics are not on par with Final Fantasy IX or Chrono Cross, this is still a great looking game.
Try it. I think you will like it.
