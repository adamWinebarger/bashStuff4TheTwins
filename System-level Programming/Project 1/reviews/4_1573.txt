This is a one player, 1st person shooter. The goal is to finish each level by finding keys, weapons and health kits all the while killing as many commies that look like monsters as possible, and trust me there are lots of  commies. There are hidden secrets throughout the game and any number of  sites on the net to tell you where those secrets are. The villians get  smarter and tougher as you progress through the game, the 1st opponents are  just some slow moving, shotgun toting targets, later levels have half  ram-half man beasts that are almost invincible shooting rockets at you!  Good thing you can get a double barrel shotgun, a minigun anti aircraft  type weapon, brass knuckles, a rocket launcher, a plasma gun, a pistol and  even a chainsaw for those up and close encounters. Ever wonder what it  would be like to walk into a building and just start shooting everyone in  sight? If so there are two things you need 1) Profesional help 2) This  game. Good deal at this price.
