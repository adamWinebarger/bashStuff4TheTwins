Once you get the hang of the controls, this game is awesome... it's challenging and entertaining, and everyone should have one.
This game has amazing graphics-- you can even see the snow spray off the board when you make the slightest turn. Plus, the camera controls are flawless. The sound track is pretty good, too- you can hear the snowboard scraping and the snowboarders sometimes talk, and the techo tracks that accompany the races are pretty cool too.
My only complaint is that there aren't enough courses. After I unlocked the 6 courses and beat the "Black Diamond" level, there wasn't much else to do. But even after you've unlocked all the courses, it's still fun to play against your friends in the 2 Person VS mode, or doing tricks in the half pipe.
I think that anyone who has a N64 should add this game to their collection, without a doubt... it's a solid game, and you won't regret it.
