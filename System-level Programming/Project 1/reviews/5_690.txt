Without any doubt, 1080 Snowboarding is probably the best snowboarding game available.
The difficulty of the controls are a little more difficult than other snowboarding games and may take a little bit more time to master, but it's well worth it. Landing correctly is also a little harder to do than normal.
The mode and track selection is very nice, offering a nice variety of tracks and available modes. The tracks offer beautiful scenery, sometimes very big jumps, jumping over cars, and a lot more.
The tricks and the stunts selection that you can perform is very reasonable. Although you can't go beyond 1080 degree turns, there are other tricks that you might not find in any other snowboarding game.
1080 also includes a Training mode, which includes two different sections, the halfpipe and a straight run with moguls. When you begin, you can turn into the left gate for the halfpipe to practice your tricks, or you can head into the right gate for a straight downhill run with moguls scattered all over. When you finish, you start back up at the main gate and you keep going until you decide to quit.
1080 also has a few secret riders and boards within the game.
Overall, 1080 is probably the best snowboarding game around, without any doubt. Would be definitely worth buying.
