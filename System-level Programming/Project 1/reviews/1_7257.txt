Wow, I expected something decent when I bought this at my local Half-Price Books store, (I was on a Mortal Kombat Craze, hell I even bought MK:Annihilation at the same place on dvd) BUT THIS IS GOD AWFUL!!!

The Presentation is terrible! You only have a Choice of 6 characters. Scorpion, Kano, Liu Kang, Raiden, Sub-Zero, Sonya. No Johnny Cage. The Game itself is just a 10 fighter tournament. About 6 fights of the same thing. then last 3 is Endurance rounds (aka tag team fighters) Then Goro fight where Goro just gropes you, then Shang Tsung fight. THE END.
Enter your name, turn off game, Rethink the past hour of your life, turn back on, name is not saved on leaderboard, OUT OF THIS HOUSE, OUT OF THIS HOUSE!

The Controls make me wish I was playing Shaq Fu! Im dead serious. Its incredibly sluggish! Every single button command has to be inputed slowly. To execute special moves, like scorpions's spear, heres how you input it:

Back, (1 sec pause), Back, (1 sec pause), B.  Don't try and speed-run this game.

The music is just an abomination, take a listen:
[...]
[...]

Overall, don't waste any money on this. If you decide to buy this, pick up some pepto-bismo on your way back to the grocery store. Or just get an SNES or Arcade emulator if you want to play the real MK1.
