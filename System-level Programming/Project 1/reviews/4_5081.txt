I bought Baldur's Gate after 2 friends kept telling me how great it was. I'm not a big RPG player, however I did find this to be a truly great game.

Positive features of the game: Visually, the game is quite well done, especially the scenary and spell effects.  The atmosphere can get quite spooky in underground caverns and during thunderstorms.  There is a lot of flexibility when it comes to character creation, and one is even allowed to double-class and choose their character's appearance.  The NPCs can be quite engaging, and party members (you can have up to 6) actually interact with each other verbally in often humorous dialogue.  The storyline is interesting and generally linear, though there are many sub-quests that one can choose to pursue.

  Regarding the down side of the game: By the time the game got to chapter 6 (there are 7), I was ready for it to end.  And the ending itself is a bit anticlimactic.  My party got up to only 7th level, and thus had rather limited abilities.  Comparing this game to Morrowind (which I am now playing), BG could have been a bit more open-ended and expansive in size, which would have enhanced its replayability.  After 12 intense days of playing to the end, I promptly auctioned it on Ebay.

  For those interested in a well-told, gorgeously rendered D&D-style adventure, with a well-defined main plot and credible monsters and NPCs, BG is a good buy.

Rating: 4.5 stars
