simply the best.  great story, great graphics, great control, great replay value.  it is true, n64 wasn't that great of a system, with pretty horrible games.  i bought it back in 98 and up until i got my ps2 i only bought a few games for it,  Zelda: ocarina, Zelda: Majora, Goldeneye, Perfect Dark, and DK64.  There may be other good games but this game is by far the best, not just on n64  but possibly out of all video games ever.  trust me people, if i say it is good, it is good.  I don't give out good reviews very easily.
