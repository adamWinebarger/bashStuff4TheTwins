This game falls short with so many other console fighting games. It has cool characters and stages,moves but not enough of these aspects to make the game shine. Thats exactly why I highly recommend the Sega CD game Eternal Champions:Challenge From The Darkside it has all the characters,moves,overkills that this 16 bit cart does and a whole lot more. In the Sega CD sequel the player has 4 brillant ways to end a match not just the one you get with the genesis game. The Sega CD version has overkills which is in this game ,but in addition has cinekills(a cinema scene where you brutally dispose of the opponent)Vendettas(where each character has a unique way to let out his/her revenge),and Sudden Deaths(another background finisher like overkills except they are harder to pull off and ends the round quicker)and tons of characters I believe 38-40 with not palette swaps like the ... Mortal Kombat series. BOTTOM LINE I GIVE ETERNAL CHAMPIONS CREDIT FOR BEING MADE TO SPAWN THE WONDERFUL SEGA CD GAME,WHICH I WOULD RECOMEND OVER THIS ANY DAY!
