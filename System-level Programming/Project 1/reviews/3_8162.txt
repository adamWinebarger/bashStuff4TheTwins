Wave Race 64. One of Nintendo's first game. Updated from v1.1. Wow. Amazing. This game is fun. OK! Game over!
Wave Race 64 is a great game. You get 8 courses, 4 players, create your custom jet ski, go into a championship, play againts your best friend.... and it's over. Wave Race is nothing special. I can't kill it too hard because it was one of the first games, but it's just too short. You can only have 2 players max. Only 1 player Championship which is 4 EASY tracks. The custom made boards arn't really custom, you just choose between 3 factors, and you can do 3 tricks! (Which, during racing, give you no bonus except if you don't complete the trick, making you fall in the water and get behind) This game get's old within 1 hour. It is not worth the price, I can guarrantee you.
