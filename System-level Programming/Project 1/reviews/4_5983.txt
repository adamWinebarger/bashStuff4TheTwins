I remember my friend and I playing rampage on the n64 (he has it) but then we went to rent a game and we rented rampage 2. so we played it and noticed that there are different monsters now and you have to unlock the original 3. We couldn't save the game (my guess was he didn't have a memory card for his n64) and it was just like the first game but graphics were better and other stuff i don't remember (we played this like, 3 years ago) and i was the rat and he was the rhino. around level 20 we both got GAME OVER!? In the first rampage for the n64, there was no game over (unless you7 quit) but hey, atleast this had bonus levels too. later i got rampage world tour (the first one) and played it with my friends and i beat it like twice. get the first one instead....Then go for this one because the first will get boring over time.
