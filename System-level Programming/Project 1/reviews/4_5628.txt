I absolutely fell in love with this game when I first played. The story can get a little confusing at times, but thats no reason not to get this game. This game uses stealth, which really makes it fun for a number of reasons. The graphics in this game are a little cliche, but then again, it came out in 99 and its for PS1, come on. Only problem, it's way too short. If there would have been say, another 4 or 5 hours added to the game, I would have given this game a 5. But due to its lack of lenght, I give it a 4...out of 5
