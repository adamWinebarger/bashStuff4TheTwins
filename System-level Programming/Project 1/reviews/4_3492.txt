Smackdown:Just Bring It for the PS2 and Smackdown 1 and 2 for the PS1 are better. But it is nothing compared to WWF Raw for the XBOX. Raw for the XBOX is better than any of them. But if you haven't got a PS2, XBOX, or Gamecube yet this is a must get game. Gameplay is good it just takes a day or maybe a little more to get use to. If you want to save money rent it and smackdown 1 or 2 and see which one you would want to have the most.
