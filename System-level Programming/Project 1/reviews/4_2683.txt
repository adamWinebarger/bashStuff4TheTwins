What can I say? Smash Bros. is just an awesome game. This is the only game you can get where all of your favorite Nintendo characters come together on one screen and battle it out. I recommend calling over 3 more of your buddies and playing it because this game is nuts when 4 players go head to head.
Overall I give Mario Smash Bros. 4 stars. I took off a star because after you obtain the 4 missing characters, the game is basically over. You can still battle with your friends, but like most games, it starts to get old after a while. I recommend it for ages 5 - 15.
