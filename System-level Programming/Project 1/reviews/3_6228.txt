I have had problems with not only the Ultima 7's but EXODUS and Ultima 2 as well.  They barely work on my computer and are a mess to start or deal with so I don't play them.  As for 7 and serpent Isle, these were very good games even graphic wise but now that my old SBPro card has been damaged I can't play them despite the fact that I have a SBLive.  I warn you, there are NO cards that use ISA slots(required for these games) You can't buy them, you can't special order them, and half the "tech-heads" I talk to don't even know what they are! You'd better have a good ISA card if you want to buy this product. Or Roland Daughterboard which cannot be purchased anywhere these days.
