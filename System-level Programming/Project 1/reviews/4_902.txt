This game was okay - it could've been better.  I like the story, it's way different than it is in the movie - it's more fun.  But like I said before, Perfect Dark 64 is the new Bond.  The main story is fun and so is the multiplayer combat.  There's a crap load of Bond characters to unlock and levels too.  But I'm not a Bond fan, in fact, I hate Bond!  But this game is fun.
