Came packaged amazingly so that the collector box did not dent or anything.
I do not mind that the cloth maps were not in the books since I've heard that the quality for them were not that great.
The bookmark and certificate all make up for it, also the "chest" the items came in.
For $107, this is a bargain! The books separately are at least $30 each.
This is a perfect LoZ collectors item.
