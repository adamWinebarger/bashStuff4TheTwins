Although I like the SNES Zelda best, you really can't make a game better than this one.  Sometimes a game is made that goes above and beyond 5 stars.  This game is like that.

A vast amount of items, all found in unique ways.  Awesome.  Lots of giant evil bosses.  Awesome.  Lots of underground hidden stuff.  Awesome.  Lots of weird folk to talk to.  Awesome.  Time travel in a HUGE mythical world.  Awesome.  Lots of mini-games to play for cool prizes.  Awesome.  Just so many awesome things packed into this ONE game.  I usually only recommend rentals, but a rental wouldn't do this game justice.  You have to buy it, you have to beat it, and you have to find every secret.  Live this game, and every now and then, live it again.

I'll also recommend buying some kind of strategy guide, or looking for tips online to find everything.  I've heard that there is a giant monsterous eel-like fish in the pond, but I have yet to catch anything like that.
