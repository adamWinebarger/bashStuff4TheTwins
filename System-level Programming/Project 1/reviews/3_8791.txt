Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force is an fps with a great story driven single player gameplay and built on the fantastic quake III arena engine. It has a good storyline with perfect voice acting and a pretty good AI. I played it on the default opengl video mode and the game runs very smoothly. The graphics are fantastic, the xen like alien levels look very georgeous, sound recording is good. charecter animation are great, crew members look very life like. The level load times are good and save games do not eat up disk space. The length of ellite force is just right and it has a great multiplayer and single player tournament gameplay. The gameplay is good, but mostly you are playing with the AI team members and it is quite bad. The level design is good and there are lots of great puzzles to be solved, Action gameplay is slightly dissapointing as some of the levels are very linear and some of them are very difficult. I did not like the selection of weapons in ellite force, they are very badly done, their effects are very disspointing, almost all weapons just shoot a straight line of colored light. Star Trek Voyoger: Ellite Force is the best star wars based game ever made but i wish it was a little better as it is devoloped by raven software.
