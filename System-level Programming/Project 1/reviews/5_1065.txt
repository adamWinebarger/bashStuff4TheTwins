Turok 2 is one of the best games ever made.

Graphics- by today's standards, terrible; then, fine. There is plenty of blood effects, from splatters to puddles (which don't really look like blood...). Gore is big also, with the ability to take the heads off of many creatures with a powerful gun or something.

Gameplay- it is amazing, the controls are odd, but is is a pioneer in the control scheme of today's FPS's. Once you get used to moving around, the game is just too much fun (even better once you get guns, rather than using a bow). There is good multiplayer too. It always feels good to leave an opponent screaming, ready to throw their controller when you get em with the weapon that scrambles their brains (yes, there is one of those, it locks on too...)

This is a game I would suggest to almost anyone (due to the amount of violence it is obviously not a kids game; I mean, look at the cover, the 2 is splattered blood).
