At first glance this game may look easy but its not. You could spend many hours just trying to figure out what everything does and even more making your numerous attempts at unsuccesful cities. The graphics are pretty good  but you need an intense system for the game to run smoothly. Maxis has once  again added their own humorous touch to the game which can add to the fun  factor. You probably won't get sick of this game very fast. If you are  looking for a huge improvement over SC2K you won't find it here. I have made  this game sound bad but it really isn't, this a very fun and challenging  game and would reccomend it only to one who likes this particular genre.
