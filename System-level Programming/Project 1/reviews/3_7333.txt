I've looked at quite a few retro X-Men games, and aside from the arcade game, this has been the only decent one I've found. This game lets you take control six of your favorite X-Men. You got your classics like Cyclops and Wolverine, but you also have the less-known but very well done mutants like Gambit, Beast, Nightcrawler, or Psylocke. Magneto also becomes an unlockable character after you beat a certain stage in the game. The level design for this game is superb. There are lots of different environments that use very vibrant colors, although some are better than others. Plus, you can team up with a friend and wipe out your enemies as a team. Playing co-op with a friend has always been one of the most nastalgic elements of my childhood so I always get excited when I can find games when I can team up with a friend. However, this game is far from perfect. It's main fatal flaw is that it is incredibly easy to walk right into the enemies because you're always on the right-end of the screen whenever you're moving forward. The only way I can play this game is when I just inch along from level to level really, really slowly. This gets boring rather quickly. Not to mention you only get a few continues before it's game over and there is no way to save your progress. This is still a lot better than the other X-Men games of its time, but is still in some need of a few finishing touches.
