Combat Flight Simulator is fun but not very realistic and it has really bad grafics. Somethimes when your playing the game a enemy shoots your plane and then theres bullet holes in the cockpit window and you survive. If that really happened the pilot would be dead. Also the planes don't try to move away from you when you shooting them so it is really easy to shoot down planes. I shot down 72 planes once. Combat Flight Simulator is not alot of money to buy so it kind of worth getting if you like WW2 combat flying game. Combat Flight Simulator 2 and 3 are a lot more fun and realistic.
