I got this game because every person said it was the best game ever. For 1998 it is, but now it's just good. Not as good as wind waker or twilight princess. The level design is good. Parts are 3d, others are resident evil camera. In short it works okay, but I screwed up many times becaus of it. the graphics were good several years ago, but now they are muddy and polygonal. Aside from that, it's zelda. Nothing new. If you buy it, don't expect it to live up to all the hype.
