At first I liked this game. Especially because of the books I found and my encounters with interesting characters. But after a while it got more and more centered on combat. Even though the combat system is great, I got bored with it after chapter 6 or 7. after a while I got really sick of the 'find the bad guy, kill the bad guy, get some stuff from his corpse, give it to the good guy, get something for yourself' style quests. The game is simply TOO REPETITIVE. After chapter 6 or 7 I uninstalled it even though I suspected I was close to the end of the game.
Alltogether, I had good fun playing this game the first week, but after that it got annoying. For a good story I would recommend PlaneScape: Torment.
