Final Fantasy VII is a good game to play. It is difficult at some points in the game. I started 3 times just to overcome the beginning of the game and to progress to the continuation of the story. The story line is good. I especially like the stealing of items from monsters, to see what all you can get,sometimes a weapon or just healing items. Sofar I,m just at the stage where I left the city, and roaming the world map. I'm trying to get more familiar with it. It will take me a long time to finish this game, since it has 3 discs, maybe I'll never finish it.
