This installment introduces some unusual elements to the series -- mainly the "instinct" gauge, which lets you look through walls and avoid raising suspicions, but I sort of miss the older approach where keeping your distance and hiding your face did the trick. (Plus you have to refill said gauge by disabling or killing enemies to be able to use it once it runs out). The visuals are vastly improved from Blood Money of course, and I appreciate their allowing me to play with my gamepad.

Some have criticized the fact that this game has "too much story" in it. I may be biased (even if I play an anti-hero, I like him having some motivation to pursue a course of action), but I didn't feel that the story took anything away from the gameplay.
