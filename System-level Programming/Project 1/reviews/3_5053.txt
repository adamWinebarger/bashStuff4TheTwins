Pros
Huge levels to explore
Decent graphics for a console game released in 1999
Very hard to die. Health doesn't deplenish very much when hit, so it's decent for kids.

Cons
Terrible camera angles
Hard to judge jump distances. Lots of falling and having to climb up to the jump again.
Short game but sometimes confusing puzzles.

All around mediocre game. Young kids probably couldn't beat it, but they would enjoy jumping around exploring the environment. My 4 year old loves to just walk around and shoot at things. When I was young this game was like the kids version of Grand Theft Auto. Buy it for the young ones.
