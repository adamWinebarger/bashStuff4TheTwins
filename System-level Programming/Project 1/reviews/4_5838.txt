Final Doom is an excellent game. I own both Ultimate Doom & Final Doom for the playstation and enjoy playing both of them. This game is a lot more exhausting than Ultimate Doom, too. Most of the levels are huge, extremely mazy, and difficult, so you'd better be a good thinker! That's right, each level is a dark, scary labyrinth of evil soldiers & monsters, so you'll need to use your brain if you plan to make it out alive. The whole key to Doom is survival, and it's not going to be easy this time. The graphics are a bit sluggish, which is why I give the game 4 stars instead of 5. But everything else (sound fx, music, controls, gameplay factor) is fine. The soundtrack in this game is very disturbing, to say the least. It helps create an incredibly eerie atmosphere that few games have ever done. The sound fx are realistic and the gameplay factor is superb.

Do I recommend Final Doom for PS1? Yes, I do. So order it now while supplies last, or be "doomed" forever!
