I will state why I like and don't like the Dreamcast.
_pros_
Good graphics
4 controller ports
56K modem built in
2 mem. card slots per controller
small size
_cons_
very NOISY
no dvd player
very small amount of games
the games stink!
cheap controllers
Even though the Ps2 is alot better system the Dreamcast is cool. It was far ahead of its time though. And the games were absolutely horrible. There were very few good ones and no, Sonic is not one of them. Athough it is a good system I would recommend getting a Playstation 2. The Dreamcast is dead and they are not making any more games for it.
