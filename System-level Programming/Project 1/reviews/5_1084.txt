I grew up with these games, So I was happy to find a Nintendo 64 at a thrift store and Im shopping online for the games. Mario Kart is a must have classic and my kids will have lots of fun. They are 8, 6 and 5 years.

I cant wait till it arrives in the mail.

No use buying the other used game systems or games that take cd. It will get scratched.  Kids cant scratch up cartridges. Its why I chose the Nintendo 64.
