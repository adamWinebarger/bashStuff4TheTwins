Spider-Man has been in a lot of games in his career, from his first adventure on the Atari to the recent game for the Playstation. Between the two, this Genesis game came out and it didn't exactly set the gaming world on fire. What you're looking at here is a very average game that doesn't do our friend Spidey justice. The gameplay is just too bland and repetitive for it to be fun. While it does have plenty of his best villians, it doesn't make it any more enjoyable. Graphics are good, sound is okay, but there are better games out there. Sadly, the Playstation Spider-Man game has been the only game to truly capture what Spidey's all about. If you have a Playstation, pick that one up. But for you Genesis owners, you're out of luck.
