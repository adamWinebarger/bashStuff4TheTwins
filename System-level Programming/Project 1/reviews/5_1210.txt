If you have an N64 you absolutely should have this game. It's a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists, new terrain and interesting characters.
If you have a GameCube I would recommend you pre-order The upcoming title "The Wind Waker" and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of "Ocarina of Time" for Game Cube. Not just the good old "Ocarina of Time," made famous on N64, but also an enhanced version called "Master Quest." Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value.
Happy Hunting.
