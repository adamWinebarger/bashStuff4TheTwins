This game is defently one of my top favorite games! I don't have it but i've rented it and it is cool. Your constantly under presure and near the end it feels like theres no where to go! In this game you shoot arrows,fight theifs,get a horse,venture in caves and much more challenges like deafeating the power hungry sorcerer Gannondorf! deffently 5 stars. Im planing on buying this game today.
