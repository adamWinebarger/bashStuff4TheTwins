Anyone who owns a Nintendo 64 and does not own Mario Kart should just throw it away.
This is a classic N64 game that's a ton of fun
even today where there are games with better graphics.

The point of the game is simple: win the race by any means.
There are no plot twists, no complicated storylines.

It has all the classic Mario characters including
Mario, Luigi, Peach, Bowser, Wario, Toad, Yoshi and others.

Once you finish everything, there is a bonus option
where you can play all levels again but backwards!

Seriously, this game is an awesome classic
and a great addition to any and all N64 game collections.

Overall,
5/5
