Five yrs ago, the toughest SNK superstars faced off in tag-team action in the excellent arcade game KOF 94. Now the series is back, but it hasn't learned anything new. The KOF:DM99(man that's a long title!)chugs away with  tired fighting mechanics and subpar graphics. King features characters from Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting. The fights are fun, but you still can't change characters during a match. Technically King's loaded with deficencies, most notably choppy, slowdown-filled 2D sprite graphics. For a part of an essentially 16 bit game to a 128 bit system, these flaws are inexcuseable and baffling. It's nice that the DC isn't limiting itself to polygon-only 3D fighting titles. But compared to Marvel vs. Capcom, Dream is a nightmare.
