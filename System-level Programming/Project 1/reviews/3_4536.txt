Well, I don't really see what the big deal is. It's one of those games that completely addicts you in the beginning, but after a while you start to get sick of watching the roller coaster you spent an hour on just go crashing to the ground.
Once you meet the first challenge, the rest are basically the same, just a little harder. All of the people I know who got the game got too tired of it before they could finish it.
Even though I don't like it now, there was a short period when I stayed up past 2AM playing it. I guess it's an average game, at first you are totally into it, but shortly after you loose interest. I recommend this game to gamers who don't really have anything to do, and are just looking for a cute game to waste their time playing. Rollercoaster Tycoon probably won't be as popular with some of the older kids, a little too young. Also, it's a little too tedious for REALLY little kids. I give it 3 stars.
