Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver - Circa 1999

GOOD:
- Mature and Dark foreboding story based on Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, with lots of twists and turns
- Voice work is really good
- Large Gothic world to explore

BAD:
- Graphics looked dated, to today video game players
- Raziel can really only use two weapons a staff and the sprit sword soul reaver
- Lots of old fashion block pushing
- Has a "to be continued ending"

IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:
- Lots of exploring, lots of block moving
- An original take on the Vampire story
- Takes place in a medieval type of world similar to Dungeon and Dragons

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:
- Tomb Raider 2
- Vagrant Story
- Castlevaina: Symphony of the night

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- This is the first game in the Soul Reaver franchises but a spin off of the Blood Omen franchises
- Blood Omen and Soul Reaver are two different franchises that fall under the Legacy of Kain franchise
- A version of this game was also made on the P.C. and Dreamcast
