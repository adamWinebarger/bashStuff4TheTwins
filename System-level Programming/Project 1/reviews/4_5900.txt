The reason i give this game 4 stars instead of 3 is because the slow loading times in beetween fights. If you owe a PS2 go to Ps driver and change the texture to smooth and disc speed to fast. The loading times are reduced by quiet alot. overall this game is great but the morphing of shang tsung can get frustrating because it has to load everytime you morph. this game is great for beginners but if you are a true hardcore MK fan get armageddon.
