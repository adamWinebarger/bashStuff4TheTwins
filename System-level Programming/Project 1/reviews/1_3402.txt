I bought NBA Showtime with the purchase of my Dreamcast hoping for some real basketball. I was sure disappointed. After playing it twice I put it away for good. The game is stupid. NBA Showtime has the worst gameplay ever. The computer can jump 50 feet in the air to make a block then swish a full-court shot. The graphics are terrible. The players' muscles' are bigger than their heads and they look very unrealistic.
This game blows! It's just like NFL QB Club except for basketball, an NBA 2KX wannabe!
Do not buy this game.  Midway sure know's how to [mess] games up!
