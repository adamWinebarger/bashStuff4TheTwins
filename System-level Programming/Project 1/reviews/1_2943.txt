What a POS this game was and still is today!! All you do is just fly through rings over and over and over and over and over again,until you wanna pull your f'ing hair out!! The controls are hard and complicated,there is no story,and the graphics look like sh..!! I hate this game with a burning passion and every single Ringman 64 cartridge that exists in the world,needs to be destroyed,so future generations of gamers are spared the agony of this giant lump of butt-waste!!
