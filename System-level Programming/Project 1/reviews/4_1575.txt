Extremely difficult to play - unless you're an expert. Have to admit - great graphics. Main problem with this particular game is that after maybe (say, an hour or so) it tends to get a bit old. Many - and I do mean many levels to conquer. I would only recommended this game to patrons who have plenty of patience. You know - the kind of -patience- that is required while you're on Ebay - trying to wait until the bid's end to an item that you want [so very bad] only to have one of those pesky last-minute snipers to come by and out-bid you within the very last ten seconds. That kind of patience. I much prefer the Atari 5200 version of this video game.
