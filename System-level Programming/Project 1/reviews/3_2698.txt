I don't see how any body can't like this game. I remember when the playstation first came out and this was the first game i got. I thought it was the coolest game ever, and i still think it's my favorite playstaion game. And im 17 now. It's a classic duke nukem game, i know the graphics aren't the best and a lot of the stuff is cheesy about the game, but regardless it's fun to play, and is easily a classic. :)
