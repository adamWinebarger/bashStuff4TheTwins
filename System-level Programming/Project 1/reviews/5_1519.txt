This game is coooooollll! Me Abigail has this game and I have 120 stars. They were soo easy to find. I do not know how I became an expert at this. For your information, I am an expert in all of my video games. I must feel like the luckiest girl in the world. But I'll give you a little info:
Title: Rainbow ride/ Star#2
You'll have to take another magic carpet ride through low-flying areial obstacles to reach the cloud house. The blue blocks that float in your way are bigger on this carpet ride and you'll have to jump on them quickly before the carpet moves out from under your feet. The Magic Carpet will take you through the cloud house twice. On both trips, whatch out for the jet of fire that comes out from the fireplace! I'ts best to stay to the rear of the carpet until the fire is out, then go to theleading ledge of the carpet. If you get knocked off the carpet, it's a log trip back to a spot where you can remount it.( there's a warp to the top of the maze on the Cloud House Balcony.)
