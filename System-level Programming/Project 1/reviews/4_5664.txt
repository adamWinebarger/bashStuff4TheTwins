This one's my favorite out of the first 4 and I liked them all (couldn't get into Chronicles or the others after). This one has the best looking tombs in the series and there's more tombs here than any of the others... until you get to the City of the Dead (more than halfway through). Then the game changes quite a bit. It becomes dark and dreary.

Puzzles are harder here. Many times you have to reenter levels to solve them. It'll take patience. But it's all Egypt and really interesting. On the other hand you can save anywhere and there's far more items you can find in LR compared to the previous three. You really have to be doing something wrong to run out of items.

Four stars for this cause (like I said) the City of the Dead the game changes dramatically all the way to the end. But the first 60% of this game was excellent.

Just want to respond to those who complain about the controls: The controls in this game is no different than the previous TR games. Rope swinging was difficult, but other than that it is the same. You can complain about TR's control scheme all together but those who didn't mind will enjoy this.
