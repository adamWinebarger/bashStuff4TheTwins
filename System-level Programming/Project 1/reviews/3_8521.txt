Like most others who might've already discovered, this Nintendo 64 - video game is pretty much for kids (ages 4 to 10). But that doesn't necessarily mean that (m)any adults couldn't get a certain amount of enjoyment out of it. The player(s) have a chance to race on several different tracks - like a dinosaur valley, an ice track, a volcano island, etc. Have to admit that the graphics to the kid's game is really quite good - at least I thought so. Can easily switch over to this game to kill - say maybe thirty minutes.
