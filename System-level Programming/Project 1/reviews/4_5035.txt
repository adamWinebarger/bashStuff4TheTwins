I fell in love with this game because of its simple interface.  Memorize a few button presses and you can be putting songs together in no time.  Pick from hundreds of melodies, bass lines, drum parts,  sound effects, and percussion samples and paste them together to make a song.  It's that easy.  You can even create your own riff if you've got the patience for it.  Then you can even create your own music video to along with your song.
  This game did not recieve as much attention as it should have, but I strongly reccomend it.  The only two flaws are the slowdown that occurs from time to time, especially during the video editing, and the songs take up an enormous amount of space on your memory cards.
