Capcom      power     levels don'  remotely resemble  ones   NES days?   understand 're talking   32-bit system   Playstation ( Saturn)  obviously  graphics  look significantly prettier   ones   NES  Super NES,  instead  running  gunning  strategically/excitedly shooting apart robot foes   respectable Mega  titles,   implements   unrelated ideas   ' okay  pass    legitimate levels.      reason X5 failed  miserably.

Yoshi' Story   released,  lot  people immediately dismissed     inferior version  Yoshi' Island  simply  colossal disappointment.  Nowadays   people    graphics   cutesy (    Yoshi' Island  guilty    ,     love  ).  ,    surprise,  actual platforming elements  Yoshi' Story      expecting,      sticks  2D  scroller instead   3D  Super Mario 64   decision  agree .      actually  Yoshi' Story   3D .

, graphics aside,   isn' ** impressive.      levels  maze-  're pretty bland compared    straight forward levels.  '   platforms themselves   particularly impressive-   average platforms 've probably experienced   NES days.  Jump  top  , ride , jump   , etc.    ' criticizing platforms  hope  understand  contradicting       paragraph-  idea  feels  little generic   undeveloped .  Furthermore,  maze levels  lackluster compared    challenging ones  Yoshi' Island.  Feels       maze stages   trying  copy  special level  world 4  Yoshi' Island   water dripping inside  looks   sewer.

  biggest    instead  collecting 10 red coins, 5 flowers  30 stars   Yoshi' Island gameplay  addicting  fun,  're collecting fruit.

Anyway, onto  positives.     Yoshi' Islands enemies   return,  despite  levels  considerably  detailed    item-collecting  variety  concerned,    stages    loaded  plenty  enemies.     levels feel pretty basic  uninteresting  design,   look forward  remembering   ol' Yoshi' Island days    enemies,    slightly bigger  size.  Plenty   enemies ,   Grim Reaper Shy Guy', extended ghosts   varieties  serve  odd short term platforms,  spike-tossing Lakitus.
