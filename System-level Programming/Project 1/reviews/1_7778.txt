If I could give no stars I would. Controller shipped quickly but was not as it was described in the listing. Quality was rated as acceptable with a loose joystick. When we opened the box the controller had two cuts (with somewhat exposed wires) in the main cord, dirt in the joystick and memory card areas and other spots that could have easily been cleaned in less then 1 minute. When we plugged the controller in the loose joystick greatly effected game play. We sent the controller back within a few days.
