well theres tons of different levels and stages you can go through.each fighter has his own special powers.before you get started youll need to inject caffiene directly into your thumbs to keep up with the computer guy.at first you should take lou kang.hes the easiest guy to learn.everythings easy once your caffiene kicks in up un til you run into goro.hes not even the boss but hes the toughest guy by far on every level.hes a big huge guy who can kill you in like 5 hits.when you hit him,it barely fazes him.just do something repeatedly like raiden[theres a real japanese god called raiden] and his torpedo spear or quan chis tele stomp.the fatalities are very gruesome.one involves a guy ripping off the other dudes leg and then beating him to death with it.ps-for some stupid reason all the cs are ks in this game.
