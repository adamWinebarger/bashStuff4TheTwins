Come now, who here really thinks they put some time into designing this  game?  The game's story is as horrible as it is clich and is being voice  acted by people that sound too much like a student film class working on a  mid-term project.
Combat consistis of clicking your mouse button in timed  bursts or uning an asinine keybord interface to swing your weapon in three  different strengths.  Whee.
Magic spell creation is novel, but quickly  become tedious and dangerous in the middle of combat when you're trying  like a madman (or madwoman) to heal yourself, but can't get the runes  lined-up in time.
And even the graphics, which are nice, are loaded with  bugs.  In most cases, whenever an enemy would drop an item, the background  would spring 'holes' of black space around it and cause nemerous graphic  flaws until it would finally crash without explination.  Furthermore, some  enemies would become 'stuck' in some void on your screen preventing you  from being able to attack it!
Overall, a terrible clone attempt at Diablo  that should make Eidos ashamed...and let's not even bring up Dikatana,  okay?
