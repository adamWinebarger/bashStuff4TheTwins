I recieved this older game quickly. But I was still playing the new Tomb Raider on PS3 and did not install it on y PC for a couple of weeks. I could not get this agme to work properly on my new computer. It loaded fine and background music worked but the graphics were .. hmm .. stone age looking. No matter how I tried to reconfigure my graphic card it would not adjust to be playable graphics. I deleted it from my computer. I gave it to my son to try and load on his slightly older system, but he hasn't tried to play yet because he is playing his new games. I will update and post what he says about his experience with it.
