I am basically buying and beating old playstation games I never got a chance to beat. I just finished this game today and it was pretty good. The controls are prettymuch identical to the early resident evil series and so is gameplay really. The story is pretty decent the only things I did not like about the game is it can become tedious running and back and fourth and some of the puzzles,  not hard,  are just kind of annoying. Good pickup if you can find it for under 10 bucks and looking to waste a saturday with a  6 pack. Game should take no more than 8 hours and thats really pushing it
