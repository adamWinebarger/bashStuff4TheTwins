Graphics: 8/10 - Ridge Racer Type 4 is plausible in this area. The car designs are fantastic and the roads are clear and well-crafted.
Sound: 9/10 - Fantastic! Not too much of this comes from the cars themselves, but the groovy soundtrack, great commentator and crashing sounds give this baby a boost!
Value: 7/10 - A fun car racing game that lasts a long time and challenges you to do better. But in this genre, we have seen games done better and you might want to go off and play them instead.
Overall: 8/10 - What can I say? I thought this was a blast. It was fun, energetic and speedy. A good instalment to the Ridge Racer series. The cars were brilliant and the Great Gran Prix is the best part. However, Ridge Racer Type 4 loses points because it is simply too much like Gran Turismo and you might tire of its same-old routine. Still lots of fun and recommended!
