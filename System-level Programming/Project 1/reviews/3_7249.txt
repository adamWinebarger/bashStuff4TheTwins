I greatly enjoyed the 7th Guest. Its sequel, The 11th Hour, is not bad, but it's not very good either. On the plus side, the graphics and the music are just as creepy and cool. On the minus side, the plot is just too stupid, and the extra puzzle elements make the game too convoluted. In the 7th guest, the plot (although not the greatest) was creepy and entertaining, and held the game together. In the 11th hour, there are some elements that are so unbelievable even horror, mystery and intrigue can't account for them (example: somebody gets raped by a house: THAT'S JUST DUMB).

The actual gameplay is also unecessarily convoluted. In the 7th Guest, you solved the puzzles to open more doors, where you could solve more, and open more, until you've been able to solve the puzzle that will take you to the end of the game. The plot elements emerged around the house as a natural part of this process. In the 11th Hour, there are actually two different goals: you have to play the word-clue puzzles to unravel the plot, but you have to play Stauf's puzzles in the House to open doors and get to where you need to go. Perhaps this was an attempt to make sure the plot was revealed "sequentially." In any case, it makes the game less enjoyable, with the word-clues seeming kind of like nagging errands which distract you from the meat of the game.

Final verdict? Play it if you have the chance to borrow it from af friend, or if you have a buddy you can play it with. But don't pay money for it.
