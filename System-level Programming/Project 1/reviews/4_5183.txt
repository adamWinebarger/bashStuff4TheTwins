The first Zork game done by Activision was Return to Zork, which looked cheap in many spots and although had some innovations it wasn't very impressive.  Next was Zork: Nemesis, which was worlds better but also very  dark and serious.  The only thing that made it a 'Zork' game were a few  familiar names and locations thrown around.  It lacked the humor of a true  Zork game.
Grand Inquisitor is both high quality and a true Zork game.  The humor is there, familiar locations are there, and the mood is most  assuredly Zork.  From a Brogmoid eating rocks to shoving a river raft in a  dragon's nose to getting a house drunk... the game is pure Zork  humor.
The visuals are from first person perspective much like Myst and  Riven, with video of various characters (CGI and live action) interspersed  throughout.  It's a 2 CD game with one Cd devoted to being above ground and  the other below.  As an added bonus, you can also play ZGI in multiplayer.  As far as I know this is the only multiplayer first person adventure game  in existance.
The premise is that magic has been banned by the Grand  Inquisitor and the head wizard has been trapped in a lantern.  Said lantern  makes interesting wisecracks as you play ("Your sword is blowing glue!  I mean.. er... glowing blue!") and helps keep a light edge to it  all.
If you like the humor of Monkey Island and are a fan of zork you'll  enjoy this game, or even if you just want to play an adventure game with a  light mood and good quality graphics.
