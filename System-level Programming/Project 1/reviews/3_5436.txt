Silent Hill - Circa 1999

GOOD:

- Considered classic to many hardcore "survival horror" gamers

- Was sort of considered too scary to play in its time, for some gamers

- A complex story, with twists and turns

- travel two different worlds, this one and a demon one

BAD:

- Graphics look pretty dated; fog is not graphically very pleasing

- Voice acting can be bad at times

- Controls feel dated

WILL IT FIT YOUR TASTE:

- Slow moving "survival horror" game, which is more about solving puzzles, managing items, and unlocking doors then actually fighting for your life

- A horror game set in a town over run with all kinds of odd creatures

- Game and story are similar to books by Steven King and H.P. Lovecraft

- Multiple endings and even some bonus unlockables

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:

- Resident Evil

- Alone in the dark

- Mist

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

- This is the first Silent Hill game in the franchise and from what I've been told this games true squeal (story wise) is Silent Hill 3 and not Silent Hill 2
