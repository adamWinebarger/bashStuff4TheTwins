Freespace 2 has a lot going for it. It's a model space flight simulation. You spend almost all your time flying and fighting with great controls, there's good AI both for enemies and your wing, graphics and sound are very good also. Additionally there's good multi-tiered story although part of it remains unresolved at the end. Some of the briefings that advance the story, introduce new weapons and review mission objectives can drag a little too long.

But as I finish the single player campaign what sticks in my mind isn't the good above but the disappointments. Most of the game takes place in a large nebula. Multi-colored 'gas' and lens flare effects fill the screen, the result feeling like playing with a large flashlight in your eyes. It doesn't improve the gameplay it just irritating. Most missions are the straight 'kill everything' type. Other missions seem designed to frustrate you. For example one mission requires you to fly a series of waypoints that are basically in a straight line. The catch is you can't see the next way point from your current one so if you waver off course you become hopelessly lost and have to start over. Finally a handful of missions are usually difficult, pitting you solo against a large number of enemies or timed with unclear objectives.

Apart from a badly-scratched install disc I had no trouble running the game in Windows 98. Nothing I tried would get the game to install in Windows 2000.
