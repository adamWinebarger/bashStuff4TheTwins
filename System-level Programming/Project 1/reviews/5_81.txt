I bought this set for my son. I am not a gamer, so I will state what I know about quality, and what my son has shared with me.

I was quite impressed with the quality of the books. Hard covered, gilded edge pages, good binding.

My son is thrilled with the content. Good graphics and he says the information is helpful.
