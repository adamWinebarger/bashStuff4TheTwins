Interesting little game, though it's nothing to write home about. Graphics are passable, acting pretty good, writing fine (better than the execution, unfortunately). Takes a while to get started, but once it really starts it's got some great moments. Not scary, except in a pleasantly spooky slumber-party-ghost-story sort of way.
