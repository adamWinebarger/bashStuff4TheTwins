Monopoly on the Nintendo 64 is great. Most people just say "all it is is boring ol' Monopoly." To be honest, it's not. I never got bored while playing this game. It has so much appeal. The graphics are great, the music is solid, the gameplay is fun, even if you're playing against the computer. The only reasons I gave it 4 stars is that all it is, well, is just Monopoly. If they added more stuff, I would love it even more.

All-in-all, it's underrated. It's definitely worth a purchase.
