Really fast delivery Takes a couple times to get the game to start but once its up it works and plays just fine  i missed this game as a kid as well love playing itGolden eye games that are coming out now owe their controls to golden eye Based on the movie the game is truly hard hiting gameplay action that is super fun This game is a very great shooting game One of the best shooting game of all time golden eye has a great story and goes along with the new  games that are coming out Redifine the origin by playing this game if you havent Sure the graphics arent that great but dude its nitendo  They should remake this game and other classic  games for nitendo gamecube If you still play  god have mercy you will also love perfect dark
If your buying this game for some reason you should add perfect dark Same game play action but for some reason I love Perfect Dark better But thats meEver since I purshased GOLDENEYE  on the old N I became highly addicted to it like many other gamers around the world I also have to thank this game as well because it made me a hardcore James Bond fan
This is the best firstperson shooting game ever Although dated the detail of this game is amazing Theres over  levels of shooting My favorite missions are the first level the Silo mission the Train mission and the very last level
Highly recommended game it fuels the senses If you like James Bond or any type of video game get it Mostly all of you haveGoldeneye  is the best game for the Nintendo  Its an amazing game and its still fun to play today There was a game called Perfect Dark that was similar to this and came out later but this is the far better game Tons of great guns and gadgets are here and the gameplay is awesome Its not the best first person shooter everHalo for Xbox is but its still one of the best The graphics arent the best ever right now but at the time in  or so they were real great The music is good It has a mysterious sound to it for some reason This game has some of the best levels in any game and it controls great Multiplayer in this game is some of the most addictive ever At the time it had the best multiplayer around It might not now since there are games like Halo and Diablo II but like I said it was the best at the time There arent really any negatives All hail to the best game on N and one of the best games everIt still boggles my mind how amazing this game is  I cannot even think or read about it without getting giddy  Another Zelda game just came out Skyward Sword and reviewers have been raving about its story and art work and graphics etc etc etc But it still doesnt compare to Ocarina of Time Not even close I have played many many games and there is no question this is still the best game ever  No one here is lying  It deserves every one of those endless stars There is a massive chasm separating this game from every other game fighting for second place No other game even comes close
Why In order of importance least to greatest
 Graphics  With consoles now like the  sporting games like Halo Reach and the PS with the Uncharted series there is some serious competition for artwork and graphics  But the Ocarina is still more mesmerizing  Yes the landscape does not extend forever into the distance and yes the polygons making up the characters are obvious but the lines created are more pleasing than any Zelda since and the colors blend and contrast perfectly  From Mount Doom to lake Hylia the imaginary world and its inhabitants draw you in and within a few deceptively short hours you cannot look away Graphics as thought of today with rocks crumbling and wood splintering when bullets strike do not exist  But they dont need to  Even the most obbsessed lover of graphics will forget their obsession as they get lost in this games beautiful open world  If you love the huge open maps of Fable  or the sprawling cities of Assassins Creed you will love this
 Controls  Games these days usually let you customize your button layout This is not nescesarry with Ocarina of Time  The N controller fits any hand perfectly and the buttons you want are always right where you want them to be  It is very easy to learn and except for its sibling Majoras Mask easier to use than any other game No crazy button combos to memorize  No wiggling of the joystick to perform random tasks  Just simple logical purposeful buttons  Perhaps in the future it will change but even after Skyward Sword I and many other people still prefer the buttons to the Wii mote If you like playing Super Smash Brothers Brawl with a gamecube controller rather than the nunchuck you will definetly prefer this And unlike Mario the cammera follows you perfectly
 Puzzles  This is not a sword hacking game though there is enough to satisfy the first person shooters  There are many very simple puzzles and many frustratingly hard puzzles but none so hard that you rip out the cartridge and throw it against the wall And if you ever get stumped there are plenty of side quests and mini games to help you upgrade your equipment or simply vent The game takes time to figure out even if that means just getting your bearings in a huge maze but there is a simple satisfaction to moving on especially when you restart and pass effortlessly through the dungeons youve already decrypted straight to the boss If you liked Myst you will love this game
Story  Most importantly story  The first time I read the Narnia series I was almost bored by its simplicity until the Last Battle at which time I finally started to recognize the symbolism and see the depth between the lines  The Ocarina of Time is likewise a simple story but there is so much depth in the admittedly simple dialogue  From the opening flames to the closing courtyard the game draws you in  You become a part of Zeldas world  You come to trust love despise or hate almost every character in the game  Even the chickens and dogs  There is a great romance between Zelda and Link hiding just beneath the surface  Anything else You want it this game has it Tension Passion Action Adventure Mystery Comedy Heroism Deceit Sacrifice  Even ghosts mummies and various undead for all you horror fans  By the time you finish the game you have made real connections for better or worse with every character in the game  And spoiler alert when Zelda turns and sees young Link walking up behind her in her garden it is so maddeningly bittersweet you dont know whether to smile or break down and cry  There is a certain Pale Rider feel as you see everyone youve helped rejoicing at their freedom from the evil King Gannondorf and yet knowing that yours is not the happily ever after you spent  years fighting for  It is emotionally beautiful  The perfect echo to the human heart
I cannot stress how highly I reccomend this game  It is  and it is still listed as the greatest game of all time on every major site  On Amazon a new copy is currently selling for  It is far and away the best game ever made  It is the best reason there is to still buy an N  If you still do not have this game buy one now  Even if you are part of the  who decides against it you will easily make all your money back at resale  But honestly you will never sell it  It will grow old on your shelf with honor and dignity as long as the silicone inside it lasts And maybe even a bit thereafterThis is to me not only the greatest Zelda game in the series but also the greatest game Ive ever play

Where to begin There is so much in this game that makes it so fun I absolutely love the side quests Getting the Biggoron Sword is a race against time but very rewarding considering you will posess an awesome huge sword that is twice as powerful as the Master Sword

Another side quest I loved was completing the Gerudo Training Fortress to get the Ice arrows This will force you to use all your skills and items and will really put you to the test I would even venture to say that the Gerudo training temple is more difficult than almost every other dungeon

The ghost hunting side quest is very tough and takes practice and patience Capture all  big poes roaming the field of hyrule and sell them to the strange ghost shop You will get the th bottle the hardest to get

Even the mask salesman side quest is very interesting and unique While many wouldnt bother to complete it but the reward is the very cool and mysterious Mask of Truth Furthermore this side quest is slightly more significant considering that the masks are the focal point in the follow up Majoras Mask

But of course my favorite side quest is the Skulltula side quest It is very long and trying but definitely worth it This is another side quest many people wouldnt bother to complete but completing it does have its merits For example there is a very profitable rewards system in play Destroy  Golden Skulltulas and you get the adult wallet holds  rupees At  you get the stone of agony which when playing with a rumble pack inserted will alert the player when a secret is nearby At  get the Giants Wallet and you can carry  rupees At  you get Bombchus I know lame At  get a piece of heart After that you get nothing more unless you manage to destroy all  golden skultullas Doing this will result in you being able to get  rupees every time you visit the house of skultulla Unlimited money is very cool although a bit useless at that late a stage in the game

The bosses are great I wont go into great detail but Ive always loved the fight with Volvagia the lava dragon There is something so classic and satisfying about watching Link defeat a lava dragon in a volcano with the master sword and hylian shield Also the final battle with Gannondorf is a real treat and I never get tired of firing the magic arrows of light at him The fight has a very epic quality to it and the final battle against the horribly mutated Gannon has a nightmarish ambience to it

The temples all have thier own awesome themes both musically and environmentally I always thought that the Forest Temple was incredibly imaginative and just stunning It has the feel of something abandoned to the wild with overgrown vines overtaking the temple and the open courtyard

The music is topnotch even by todays standards Koji Kondo really put together a masterpiece

There is even a sweet element of sadness in Links lost childhood with the loss of his friendship to Saria The moments where Shiek teaches you a song to warp to a temple always has a reference to a long lost friendship or the somewhat cruel passage of time

The ability to customize adult Links appearance is pretty unique and cool where you can choose with color tunic he wears which sword and shield to wield

In short this is a wonderful game that will always have a special place in my heartIf you like racing games Mario Kart  is among the best The game is very simple to control theres no bulls ranking system like in some of the newer games and is actually a challenge The game is stupidly fast and will make you actually feel like youre racing The game may be a bit dated but its fun as hellZelda OCT is an actionadventure RPG there is debate about this and some argue Zelda is its own genre with a combination of puzzles fighting and racing Anyone who enjoys this genre will be enthralled by OCT which you can play on several Nintendo platforms including the  and Gamecube I still play Zelda OCT  years later on the Gamecube from time to time its that good of a game

Graphics
For the time period Zelda OCT on the  was beautiful and it has stood the test of time FAR better than other older games on consoles It was the first truly D game for a console and set the standard for what video games should look like If you grew up on newer systems and PCs these graphics will look blocky to you but the Gamecube has an OCT version with more refined graphics Still if you want a retro video game experience the N Zelda OCT has graphics that are still enjoyable today

Story
The Zelda story is perfect for a video game as the basic premise is always the same Link a young boy or young man in newer games is the reincarnated hero of time He must battle the evil GanonGanondorf to save Hyrule and princess Zelda by using the power of the Triforce

Zelda OCT molds the Zelda Story into a fantastic tale that will take a least a few months to beat for your first time The games puzzles become progressively more difficult culminating in the notoriously challenging dungeon  the Water Temple The story combines several races Hylians Kokiri Gerudo Gorons and Zora seamlessly into one large kingdom The enemies are varied and interesting as well The FantasyAdventure story line is complex and intricate complete with twists and shocks timetravel and genocide Time affects the characters and you see that not everyone loses when evil prevails The story details are amazingly deep to the point that pictures on someones wall and the clothes they wear can fill in some back story of that character I loved the detail and enjoyed filling in little pieces of the back story by talking to the NPCs and looking through the first person scope at their tattoos and clothes The main story is also amazing with the typical epic swordclashing adventure ingeniously employed in the Zelda OCT universe Its truly a masters greatest work

Game Play
The  had a simple controller for fun game play There are only a few buttons A B Z Cpad R L joystick and the Dpad The Dpad isnt needed in Zelda  This limited key selection was used to build an elegant fighting system around a few button combinations Although B always attacks and A always does an action the genius of this system falls in the types of attacks you can do Depending on the way your character is moving and whether or not an item is targeted Link can perform an impressive list of sword attacks vertical cut horizontal slash diagonal slash spin attack thrust and jump attacks Despite the fact that B Z and the joystick are the only buttons that control these moves Link is easy to control and I never had problems getting Link to perform the combination of moves I desired Link could cut any sign into  unique pieces consistently  that is excellent controller response

In addition to the perfect synchronization of Link to the game controls something newer games like Dark Souls could take a lesson on the game play is interesting and varied Although the main fighting style will be slashing it up with your sword each monster has a unique weakness that you can take advantage of with a variety of weapons Link not only totes a onehanded sword and shield but he also gets access to a sling shot and deku seeds boomerang hook shot bow and arrows bombs deku sticks deku nuts and two impressive twohanded weapons a hammer and a sword These weapons can all be used in different ways to different effects at various times in the games

Although the game would have been interesting enough with just those weapons the game is further varied by magic Link can wield three types of hand magic as well as three types of magic arrows This adds another level of monster fighting where Link tries to find the weakness so he can move in and dice them up

Apart from the impressive array of weapons Link also packs a varied wardrobe The stoic hero is far from interested in fashion I mean he runs around in a tunic and tights with a long cap so he obviously doesnt care about his looks so each piece has a specific use You can mix and match boots and tunics for different benefits Some bosses can only be beat with the right combination of clothing and shields and figuring out how to use which items against a difficult boss is part of what makes Zelda OCT a great game

Wait theres still more to combat Apart from the variety of moves and effects Link can muster with his impressive array of items there is also horseback combat You can ride around on Epona a fierce wild mare who only listens to you and shoot things with your bow and arrow There are also mini games centered around the fun and challenging horseback combat

Summary
Zelda OCT is an excellent ActionAdventure RPG with an epic story line that seamlessly melds a complex kingdom and elegant fighting style into a grand video game The characters are interesting with even the most minor sentinels having a back story that you can uncover The main story is fun to progress through and you care about a lot of the characters you meet The controls are excellent and perfectly integrated for fun nonfrustrating game play The bosses are challenging requiring wit to uncover their weakness from the surroundings and circumstances before you can move in and damage them with your sword

Final Note
If the  is too retro for you Zelda OCT has been remade for the Gamecube with newer graphics However the Gamecube controller does not integrate as seamlessly as the  understandably so you will miss out on a large part of what made Zelda  great Additionally there is a DS version but I havent played that so I really cant commentThis has been deemed the bestmade game of alltime and even though its going on  years since its release I cant disagree

People complain that this game has no replay value is too easy and the graphics arent good

Well Ive revisited this game several times since it came out in  and I havent found a lack of replay value theres so many submissions I dont see how you cant think of this game as novel and new every time you replay it

This game has a perfect balance of gameplay for firsttime gamers and extra submissions for experienced ones Think its too easy Obviously you havent gotten all the heart pieces found all the Skulltulas earned all the jars achieved the Biggoron sword or caught the Hylian Loach Any one of those tasks would create a challenge for anyone

Complaining about the graphics Sorry the game isnt on XBOX or Playstation format In  this game had stateoftheart graphics As I am in the process of beating this game for a third time in  I still dont find the graphics something to complain about

This game excels in both gameplay and storyline I find it hard to believe that anyone who has played at least half this game would say they hate such a masterpieceIt sometimes go out of wack when the clapping parts in a song show uplike you hit it but it doesnt register no matter how hard you smack it and the game doesnt register you as singing onkey when you know for a fact you are but other than that it works greatSimply the best single player RPG i have ever played From start to finish you will not be dissapointed Please if u get the chance go after majores mask its also a great gamemario kart  is the greatest video game in the universe a true classic the best of the best mario kart  rocksThis is one of the most fun multiplayer games you can play on the Nintendo   The single player portion of the game is enjoyable too but the real fun is in the multiplayer and racing and battling your friends  My friends and I logged countless hours with this game  The only negative I have is the AI cheats something awful in the single player portion but aside from that its a great game in every sense and a true classicMy game came in fantastic condition I love playing it with my sis but she just went off to collegeGood working N game cartridge in good condition same for the box A great find of a timeless classic AFAIAC this is the best Mario KartI love this game this is the coolest game ever brings back great memories from my childhood playing this game it never gets old to playMy weekends during high school revolved around playing this game with friends yelling and ingesting copious amounts of koolaid and chips  Maybe its the nostalgia talking but even today this game is insanely fun to play  Lets remember the N  Cartridge system ahead of its time player of some of the most memorable games of the past  years  Mario Kart  is definitely one of those games  Graphically it was gorgeous in the s  The colors are vibrant character models are blockyantialiasing wasnt cared about much back then and the music freakin rocked  Game play is excellent with each racer having their own feel  There are tons of power ups and weaponized items to truly jack up your competition which helps to create some of the most frustration last second finishes or losses probably ever

For nostalgias sake get this game pop it in disregard that it looks blocky on a new TV and enjoy the memoriesIt plays great and i look forward to beating my fance We place bets on who will win and the looser has to do the choreseven with all the improvements in systems games graphics etc this one remains a classic in all sense of the wordThis is my favorite of the series My cousin and I used to play it all the time and it is how I remember Hit detection is a little offI used to play this game all the time when I was a kid I recently came into an N and just had to get it Game works perfectly and it arrived quicklyThis mario kart is my favorite of any in the series and i am so glad i bought it because i have had so much funMario Kart  this game is fun youll play this over and over My favorite board is Mushroom  level its easy thats why and you pick up items to used from keeping your opponent from taking the lead Great buyThis has to be one of the best multiplayer games created for the Nintendo  This kind of game is great for all ages Im  years old and my friends and I still to this day continue to play Mario kart It is a perfect racing game that has great sound effects and can keep you entertained for hours You can play it by yourself but to get the true experience of this game its best to play it with others There is really no story line to the game just a bunch of maps and characters to choose to race with If you get bored of racing over and over again there are several mini games known as battle games to choose from Honestly I like playing the battle games more than I like racing because its fun to take down your friends and family So overall I would definitely say get this game if you dont have it It is a must buy for avid Nintendo  usersSo much fun It improves the st one so much love the settings menu the blood and physics are awesome
If you get this game I would recommend the superpad  the one that looks like a modern controller just because this game dose use the dpad crap get that controller anyway
love this game
One of the few games i know that you can shoot some ones neck and watch the blood squirt out or blow limbs off
love itBought Turok  just because I played and still have the original Turok Game came in great condition and could play it instantlyAnother neat turok game with crazier weapons tougher enemies better level design and more funGreat game I wish I had more time to play it  its always been and always will be one of my favoritesThe price was reasonable and the game shipped relatively quickly  Most importantly it works  What else could you ask forI use to love this game and after purchasing this one I found I still do The game was of quality and is still working just fineAnyone who likes  would enjoy this game great first person shooter I will enjoy playing this game The game play is a bit strange and hard to get use to because the aim and movement joysticks should be switched The c pad on the N controller is hard to move with Great game with practiceEnjoying playing this game with no complaints Met my expectations and would do business again with this seller againTurok  when I was younger as a kid was amazing no parents told me I was not aloud to play it because they never actually played it themselves to know The graphical content and gore was stunning to my  year old eyes The first level took me forever to beat and I only beat it once Plus I didnt have a controller pak Then came the day I bought it again for my n nothing looks more sexy than Turok  in a green nintendo  The first time I ever beat it and it took as long as it did to beat a metroid game and there are only  levels Weapons in old games to begin with were always amazing I was always able to hold as many as they would let me Such as doom Turok South park Armorines perfect dark etc Then new games came along and ruined everything that is great about Fps Sure they have better graphics and frame rate But they are all the same to be honest Emulators sucks ass I dont care if its rgb or not But just old games from dos to the beginning game cube fpss are all I got But something about the way a n looks and the way the graphics look on it just make me love it so much To me its the best looking system and has the best looking games Turok tops it all Way ahead of its time it set the standard of what the n was capable of Turok  is on pc and n The n game had stencil bits and made the game take a hit in frame rate Stencil bit shadows were a new thing in  so iguana tried it out In my honest opinion I wouldnt have even cared if the shadows were just the classic circle or just no shadows at all Still it is stunning the n could handle what was thrown at it The AI in the game was the most fascinating thing I have ever seen in a game and still is They are smart and fight one another really fun to watch I found the game to run best in HiresLB and looks the best as well The weapons are still the coolest weapons in any game on the face of this planet and all of them are uniquely different My favorite weapons are the Tek Bow Shotgun Warblade Razorwind Cerebral bore Plasma Rifle Mag Grenade launcher the kick ass Charge Rifle ONE OF THE BEST LOOKING WEAPONS Firestorm Cannon like a minigun but different and bad ass sounding Nuke Flamethrower The first fire to actually show D even in almost all games on n and the torpedo Launcher because you can go through water faster Music has always been one of my favorite things when it comes to games because the music sets the mood and Turok  has the best music in any n game I have ever heard sorry Perfect Dark your music and KAvenger are great to but Turok is to bad ass Iguana seemed to like it so much and acclaim that that the music is in all Turok games as well as Vexx and Armorines and more have some similar sound The multiplayer in Turok  to me is absolutely stunning I run that in lowres and is just as good as Goldeneye Perfect Dark The world is not enough and Turok Rage wars Quite a few games ran on the Turok engine as well Armorines a amazing game Uniquely different yet just as awesome and South Park not many liked this game but to me its like a mixture of DoomTurokSouth park The multiplayer is good to just dont go above  players So you see Turok  was used in many things and is an amazing game Once you play it you will wish iguana and acclaim still existed They were the company that developed and distributed games with their say so Making their games unique Most hated their games but they never looked at the work they did Extreme G for example had so much done to it that it to suffered frame rate and certain levels were unplayable in single player Grand Prix but in time trials they all ran smooth and helped with remembering everything Extreme g to me is the best out of the series I have almost every game by Acclaim and love every game except turok  its a good run the first time but compared to dinosaur hunter and seeds of evil it is crap So Turok  is amazing if you want to try it get it now on n or even on PC You will love the game and see all the death animations and creative designs and levels Turok is the greatest fps try them all your own risk for  but a good to the collection Dinosaur Hunter  amazing smooth game great n game the first fps on n Seeds Of Evil  Worthy sequel and is amazing in graphics and game play Shadow Of Oblivion a okay game for the first run but great for the collection Rage Wars the true sequel or attachment to Turok  and has great multiplayer and just as bad ass guns Evolution fantastic remake of the first Turok starring Talset and has amazing weapons and is the biggest game of them all featuring over  chapters and has awesome multiplayer Turok PCps I played it on  Runs on the Unreal Engine which is bad ass a great game with good weapons Why I liked it is because I was quick and accurate I run faster than slow ass call of duty and has worthy death animations like Turok  but not as good and not as good music awesome multiplayer if anyone is on and a good campaign These are the Turok games Which started out as comics and became life and were playable Get Turok  you will enjoy it And bring a few friends over It is A True Turok Game and is worth being played even in todays cliche fps trigger happy CoD fansAnyone who owns a Nintendo  and does not own Mario Kart should just throw it away
This is a classic N game thats a ton of fun
even today where there are games with better graphics

The point of the game is simple win the race by any means
There are no plot twists no complicated storylines

It has all the classic Mario characters including
Mario Luigi Peach Bowser Wario Toad Yoshi and others

Once you finish everything there is a bonus option
where you can play all levels again but backwards

Seriously this game is an awesome classic
and a great addition to any and all N game collections

Overall
This is the one game that I would play day in and day out for more than a year  The one game where I discovered something new almost every time I played  It was the one game which brought me and my friends together religiously at least  or  times a week  Somehow it just wouldnt die no matter how hard we tried
At first it just seemed so standard and bland  Playing muliplayer for the first time I had problems finding guns and felt confused and bored running through the Temple level  soon somehow something clicked and me and my friends  ended up playing it for about  hours straight  Towards the end of that introductory marathon Goldeneye session we took our first stride out of the standard Deathmatch restriction increasing my characters health to its highest limit and my friends fighting against me  Thus we coined the God mode and we played this variant to death in the coming months
It didnt end there  We had fests where we would do nothing but attack each other with punches  We bought a bunch of video cable and conected three televisions together to form a sort of splitscreen LANtype mode covering up other players screens so we wouldnt know where the other players were  We playedthe Team mode constantly refining our knowledge of the levels and our marksmanship  Fed up with autoaiming we turned it off and further honed our skills  I began to be able to play the Complex level in my sleep  Proximity mines soon became an addiction  We pushed the game to its limits learning that we could move the ammo boxes shields and guns around by shooting them thus reworking their positions and creating large stockpiles in team games  We began to use Gameshark to unlock multiplayer maps that werent intended for the final version as well as increasing the limits on two and three player maps to four players  We discovered a code that turned one player invisible and proceeded to do hunterhunted scenarios over splitscreen
Basically it was the first game to really show limitless possibilities  It was a revolution for firstperson shooters and so many have overlooked this fact  It was the first to have targeting of individual body parts over  weapons to choose from realistic glass shooting out of lights and bullet holes and for its time fairly revolutionary AI  All in all it was an experience that defined video games for me and few if any have matched it with a similar addictive experienceBRThis game more than any other for the Nintendo  is what will come to mind when most ppl think of the N  Mainly because this was one of the first shooter games to require the gamer to use his brain to solve puzzles and get thru the nasty surprises the game will throw at you  Not following the bloodlust of previous first shooter games like Doom Heretic Turok etc this game is in a class of its own  It gives you objectives to complete however unlike Perfect Dark it adds to the challenge by giving you deadly surprises that are NOT mentioned in the mission breifing these will make at least restart a few levels over and over until you figure it out for yourself  Its a much better game than any other First shooter Ive played since it stresses Stealthy behavior and intelligence on the part of the player to succeed
Granted it does not have the extras in the Multiplayer section that Perfect Dark has but it has an element of challenge that Perfect Dark will never haveEven for a Gamecube and PS owner for me this is the game that started it all And while old Goldeneye is still exhilerating I was stupid enough to trade in my Goldeneye copy for a nwer but NOT better game Dont make the same mistake that I did please It is hard to get your hands on a good copy of Goldeneye these days Protect your Goldeneye games This game lives up perfectly to the movie and for a  game the graphics and sound are excellent Sure Nightfires fun but it never revolutionized the gaming world like Goldeneye did Goldeneye shoots TWINE and Agent Under Fire out of the sky Nightfire cant even hold its ground against this solid and superb N title In Goldeneye you will encounter all of the characters and locations from the Goldeneye film and the single player campaign holds its ground But multiplayer is where the game really shines and it is so much better than Timesplitters or Timesplitters  even I have not played Goldeneye for over a year but the music rings in my head and I have the levels memorized perfectly Even if you worship your Perfect Dark copy I believe that Goldeneye is better and I have a strong debate on that The bottom line is that Goldeneye is the BEST FPS EVER CREATED It boils down to thisif you own an N please play your Goldeneye copy or if you dont even know what this wonderful game is about buy it now Hey all XBox owners Goldeneye is even better than Halo Theres no debate on that Buy the game that started it all My RatingGoldeneye lookes like just another shootem up game but it is more than that Goldeneye takes James Bond to the next level
Pros graphics are great
 player is fun
lots of cheats to make the game even better
alot of characters to choose from
Cons a little to easy to beat
no voices during game play
not alot of multiplayer levels
In the end Goldeneye is a great game and I recommend it to anyoneNo doubt the best Nentendo game ever created up till this day  This game is better than all the Nentendo games for all its systems  It has the best multi player game ever for any system and a A single player game  The only thing about the multiplayer game is that it could use a bit more weapons  And the single player game is up there with Metal Gear Solid the original  Its game has lots of levels and is very challenging but in a good way  Its cheat options are really hard to get but once you do it makes the game even more awsome  So overall you only need one word to describe this game spectacularThis is a cool game  You complete every mission on  agent and you unlock the  difficulty level  You dont need a memory pak or card to play this gameTurok  is one of the best games ever made

Graphics by todays standards terrible then fine There is plenty of blood effects from splatters to puddles which dont really look like blood Gore is big also with the ability to take the heads off of many creatures with a powerful gun or something

Gameplay it is amazing the controls are odd but is is a pioneer in the control scheme of todays FPSs Once you get used to moving around the game is just too much fun even better once you get guns rather than using a bow There is good multiplayer too It always feels good to leave an opponent screaming ready to throw their controller when you get em with the weapon that scrambles their brains yes there is one of those it locks on too

This is a game I would suggest to almost anyone due to the amount of violence it is obviously not a kids game I mean look at the cover the  is splattered bloodTurok  Seeds of Evil is the sequel to Turok Dinosaur Hunter that not only surpasses that game in its greatness but is my most favorite game in the series of four games that came out on the N Everything that made the original such a great game to play was improved upon especially in the way of graphics With the expansion pak graphics had almost a Playstation  quality to them Its something that showed with this game It showed in the textures of the environments the details of the architecture lighting effects and other eye candy The game was also bigger and better than any other game with the exception of Zelda Ocarina of Time in its  meg cartridge As youve probably read in the courtesy review its been stated to have over  hours of playtime While I dont know about that personally as I hadnt checked where I stand within the gameone thing I do know is its one lengthy meaty game to sink your teethplaytime into

While Turok  Seeds of Evil stood in the shadow of Rares Goldeneye during its release Turok  still stands the test of time in terms of gameplay and is one game every Nintendo fan should add to their collection If not for the fact that it had a killer storyline and an awesome arsenal of weapons to play with then for the fact it was an absolute beauty of a gameThis game is fun The visuals are impressive and the guns are frickin cool and some fun multiplayer Play this game because you deserve something special Unless youre a Dragon Ball Z fanI bought Mario Kart  for my nephew for his birthday I played Mario Kart  when I was a little and I loved it My nephew already has Mario Kart DS and he loves it I figure that he will love this game too Mario Kart  has many different levels in which you can race other Mario characters such as Luigi Wario Donkey Kong Bowser and many others I would recommend this game to anyone who likes any of the newer Mario Kart gamesThis game I grew up with and enjoy very much I have been playing this game since I was  or  years old and games like these are very hard to come by right now and they cost a pretty penny brand new What I have is a like new version but unforutantely I lost the manuel and the box is long gone to mine but maybe I will find it one day while I shop around the internet I love this game and recommend this game to old school video game players and the likeIf you grew up on N and Still love gaming You will still love Mario Kart  Play This gameThough Wolfenstein D and the Doom franchise had come and gone long before its time Goldeneye for the Nintendo  grabbed the First Person Shooter genre and ran with it for what seemed like miles and miles Forget a touchdown this game ran the ball for fifteen hundred yards with three interceptions and a dozen field goals Nothing on a home console was even close to its league And even today in the afterglow of behemoths like Halo Metroid Prime and a limitless roster of PC shooters the game holds up surprisingly well considering its limitations

Its difficult to call any game perfect No matter how original how exciting how breathtaking it may look sound play or feel there remain a couple frustratingly overlooked areas and Goldeneye is no exception Most notably poor are the one or two levels which feature a limitless stockpile of enemy soldiers No lie Ive memorized the layout of a base from start to finish known theres nowhere these soldiers could be coming from and watched as dozens and dozens miraculously appear from thin air to resume their fallen brothers attack It makes strategy an impossibility and frustrates the player to their wits end In addition theres the small matter of dead or dying enemy soldiers who stand in the way Every once in a while an armed adversary will take a head shot and then stand blankly staring for several moments before slowly dropping to the floor This wouldnt be such a bad thing if the other soldiers bullets couldnt pass right through him So youll often find yourself firing into the chest of a dead man a futile attempt to get at the soldiers behind him all the while taking fire from those still breathing on the other side of his body Despite my small misgivings however  of this game plays flawlessly The progression of difficulty is astounding moving from the relatively easy early levels to a series of seemingly impassible stages near the carts conclusion And its all done while walking that razors edge between being excessively cheap and being overly giving The player realises these missions are possible even as hes watching Bond die for the twelfth time in as many minutes

Add to all that three difficulty levels cheats that must be unlocked with speed precision and overall knowhow hidden stages and hidden characters Not only do you have a legendary FPS youve also found nearly limitless replay value Goldeneye is more than just a very good game its the stuff legends are made of Its a game youll want to play with your grandkids years from now

Hands down the most attractive part about Bonds N debut even today is its controls The Nintendo  controller was seemingly created exclusively for use with s repertoire as every button is in precisely the right place for its function It truly is the kind of thing that takes five minutes to learn and a lifetime to master The center grip of the N controller seems to BECOME the handle of a silenced PP Bonds revolver of choice The Z button is a perfect trigger and if youve purchased a Rumble Pack you can even feel the weapon kick back when you fire Strafing is done effortlessly with the right hand as is crouching and adjusting the zoom of a sniper rifle No control system has ever felt so immersive so right After the first level you hardly recognize the controller is there its already become such an extension of your own body I cant sing any higher a praise than that

If youve seen the feature film of the same name youll notice some eerie similarities Everything from the writing on a wall in the city to the placement of the soldiers deep within a Russian bunker is precisely as it was seen on the silver screen Its honestly unsettling how well the level designers did their jobs Ever wondered what was behind that last bathroom stall in the film Youll get your chance to find the answer on the N Its an experience I cant really put into words something Id never seen before and havent seen since Its a level of perfectionism that has yet to be matched in a video game adaption

Finally theres the multiplayer aspect of  While the singleplayer mode is challenging unique and groundbreaking multiplayer is absolutely unreal I had the good fortune of living in a large college dorm complex at the time this game was first released and thus experienced more multiplayer Bond than Id wish on anyone There were literally lines leading into my room just for the chance to grab one of our four controllers and get into the action It was an addictive community event whenever that little red light on the front of our N lit up Truly something special With multiple modes of play a handful of playable levels some hidden surprises and dozens of options you were guaranteed to never play the same match twice and it didnt take much for the lighthearted action to become a coldhearted war In a time and place where four player deathmatches are a nobrainer its hard to imagine a game that pioneered the field Goldeneye blazed that path and did so in style It cleared out the weeds flattened the hills and paved the roads that Halo drives its way across today Truly the game was revolutionary and it still plays as such

In short Goldeneye is almost reason alone to own a Nintendo  even today Theres a charm about it that cant be described a realism and authenticity that goes beyond the aging graphics and occasionally slow gameplay Its got the look and feel of a legend and thats exactly the word Id use to describe it While there are certainly flaws this is a game youll kick yourself for never owning in a few years when it becomes increasingly difficult to track downMy N it acts like a rock sitting right there under my tv I bought a total of  count em  games on this pathetic system I have what about  for my computer But this game made me believe that a good shooter could be made on consoles although very few of the ports from pc to consoles are usually the original games for the consoles are goodOf those  games I have this one is worth about  The makers of this game are geniuses and have spread that on to other games like the timesplitters series if there is any game that will make me buy a gamecube besides metroid prime it IS timesplitters  It is a master peace that will be lived on in my memories and it will remain stuck in my damn cartrage slot of my forgotten n or it would be forgotten if not for this gameThe names Bond James Bond Those five words mark the saying of probably on of the most famous fictional spy of all time And finally he came to the Nintendo  This game is by far the best game for any console It kicks Resident Evils butt all the way back to campcoms facility to teach them not to make such stupid looking gamesGoldenEye became the steeple for how the Bond series was going to be and Im glad that it was because for me I could never get tired of this game because of its awesome challenges graphics gameplay and of course the gore factor very bloody game Maybe a no for younger gamers but for those of us older gamers a definite
Level after level this game played almost to a T like the movie and you got to use all of Bonds weapons from his magnum to a bazooka to grenades and plastic explosives and of course the one hit kill Golden Gun
This also had the perfect multi player vs mode in the history of the  system Where else could you blow up  of your friends with a bazooka at the same time if you were lucky enough to stumble upon them shooting it out with each other
GoldenEye has never left my  rotation and again I still love to play the multi player when my friends come over I will again stress to those of us who are parents like myself that you should maybe think otherwise if you have some young gamers because it is very violent and very bloody For those of you without that restriction go wild and get this game You wont be disappointedI still get this game out Everything is ideal if they cant recreate this it will be a shame N ruled in the old days this and Mario were so amazingly fun it was constant you could play for months on end and still love it to death while finding something entirely new and excitingHandsdown the best N game  Goldeneye is very similar to the movie like the Siberian dam mission the satellite control facility etc The graphics are the best Ive seen for the N except for Zelda  the first one  The autoaim feature and person multiplayer make the game perfect for the common area of a dorm roomWhen I heard about turok  comming out I was so friggin phyced
I wasnt dissapointed
It was even bettter than the first  It was
a little sci fi for me though  And what was up with turok
He looked so young  I really didnt get the story  If you get the cheats its even better  Even more awsome weapons for you to
use  You kick alien ass and take names
This is one of my favorite sequals for a video game
Its very original  The game is frustrating without cheats but
its really fun and cool  Its pretty much as violent as the
first one
I love this game
Great graphics
Great gameplay
Great storyKina confused with turok bein young
OVER ALLITS A GREAT GAME
WAY TO GO ACCLAIMAfter playing Turok The Dinosaur Hunter for ten minutes I realized I had a great game at hand It was like Mortal Kombat except in a shootinggame Blood everywhere amazing enemies and weapons and a good good time And Ill admit this I dont actully play the Turok games No Im sorry I dont Its not that their hard or boring but I dont play themwell not without the cheats at least As soon as I find out a new Turok games coming I get on the internet go to Happypuppycom and find the Master Cheat Yeah its pretty low but its fun to go in these bloodsoaked shooter games And the second one is no exception I played this game without cheats for a few hours made up my mind and decided it was great and would be even better with cheats
Half an hour later I came back with the Master cheat in my hand which is BEWAREOBLIVIONISATHAND or if you break it down BEWARE OBLIVION IS AT HAND Within minutes I had an amazing arsenal all maps invincibility and more by my side The weaponswell lets just say the first Turok cant touch them You have the usual knife and bow and arrow pistol shotgun and the rest but you now also have a nuke pod layer which lays bombs on the ground and they explode on contact a machine gun as the first had but this ones much better the Cerebrial Bore the most gory weapon of all It launches out a little ball and it goes straight for the enemies head When it gets there it starts sucking and draining blood form their head then after  second it explodes and takes the enemies head with it my personal favorite the Razor Wind a shield with sharp edges on it You throw it and it cuts up all enemies in its path then come right back to you It can chop off just about any limb you throw it at the head the legs and the arms and another physical weapon the War Blade The name says it all
Overall this game is a vast improvement and is the best yet but that might change as soon as I play Evolution The graphics are great awesome story vast detailed enviroments and some hot blue chick that always pops up What more could you ask forProbably a top three game as far as popularity is concerned on the n Just a simple racing game with the original Mario cast but a game that was a lot of fun Multiplayer mode was even better as it made for real good fun competition amongst friends Truly a classic game that is a must for n collectionI grew up with these games So I was happy to find a Nintendo  at a thrift store and Im shopping online for the games Mario Kart is a must have classic and my kids will have lots of fun They are   and  years

I cant wait till it arrives in the mail

No use buying the other used game systems or games that take cd It will get scratched  Kids cant scratch up cartridges Its why I chose the Nintendo Excellent game all around except one thing
The game CHEATS
You can be in first place and magically all the computer controlled racers somehow manage to catch up to you anyway
Now if youre in last place you literally have no chance of catching up
Not fair
Not cool
That asideif you develop your skills youll still win
After much practice I still managed to beat the game even though it blatantly cheats

Great graphics
Every character you love from the Mario universe
I think Toad is my favorite when he gets hit LOL The noise he it makes is hilarious
The courses are inventive and enjoyable
The music fits in perfectly

Did I mention it cheats
Thats my only complaint
Otherwise another five star winner from Nintendo
Highly recommendedMario Kart  is the true D Nintendo  sequel to Super Mario Kart Since the characters wouldnt look so great on karts in D on the N the sprites are in D which explains how they are fully detailed

There are  courses you can race in along with  courses for your average Battle Mode

Now that there are  players the  Player modes can be pretty fun especially Player since it has all the options from Player Mode

The item roster is slightly different from Super Mario Kart but its fun to use them all

Overall Mario Kart  is another game that defines D gaming on the Nintendo The levels are great and there is a lot to do to save the world in the nick of time before some bad happens YOU as bond As you go into the game they are other bad guys are trying to kill you as you try to save the world HEY buy this game you will have a time of you life and trying to stay alive Hey it true it is a good game to play by yourself or two people Hey go buy the game and find out what Iam talking about OK I play it over TEN time because it GREAT to get into By the away they are FOUR bad guys are after you so run run RUN for your life well just in the game are you lucky Dont spoil yourself over this game I have KEEP YOUR COOL IN THE GAME SO GOOD LUCKY PS Your going to need it There are easy levels and hard levels and there are very hard levels Get ready for a big adventure to save the world There are Characters in the game just like the movie is that cool or whatWith the Nintendo  beginning to slowlyokay quickly drop off the gaming radar its time for gamers who bought the last of the Big Ns cartridge systems to see if their investment was a good one Is there even a reason to keep this system around anymore Is there one game to give you an excuse to say to Playstation and XBox and Gamecube owners I know its an old system but this game is the reason I still own it Yes and that game is called Golden Eye 
Its hard to believe that a game based off the best of the Pierce Brosnan Bond movies would become an undeniable classic But thats exactly what Golden Eye is Many firstperson shooters try to overwhelm gamers with unbelievable graphics while offering no depth in gameplay while others try to create complex game engines with passable graphics and end up only frustrating players Thankfully Golden Eye is the diamond in the rough It takes a remarkably simple control scheme and graphics that were good for its time and combines them in an unbeatable combination Moving Bond James Bond is as easy as breathing and the shooting system is just as simple Even with the horrible N controller a player can learn how to play Golden Eye on the first or second try And its gameplay is so addictive because of the stunning level designs and adequate AI Of course because of the Ns difficulttoprogram cartridge format some things had to be sacrificed like detailed textures and realistic AI responses to being shot But the overall experience is enough to overlook such trivial matters
Graphically Golden Eye  was a marvel to look atwhen it was first released Nowadays when compared to games like Metal Gear Solid  for the PS and Dead or Alive  for the XBox Golden Eye looks like a SNES game Because cartridges are limited in space textures can be bland character models look blocky and detail is kept to a passable minimum But anyone who doesnt care about graphics as long as they are good enough and the gameplay is excellent shouldnt have any trouble with Golden Eye
Soundwise its not the biggest strength of the game but its still good Sounds like gunshots are remarkably well done  a player can tell what kind of gun he or an enemy is firing just by listening to it at least to a certain extent And voices while limited to overdone grunts and questionable laughs suit the game well It wouldve been nice to hear full voiceovers for important characters but the limitations of the cartridge format doesnt help this area much
All in all Golden Eye is undoubtedly a classic of modern gaming While the N is arguably one of the worst Nintendo consoles to be released alongside the horrendous Virtua Boy it still had some incredible games that managed to sustain it until the Gamecube was announced Golden Eye is not only the game that many FPS fans point to as their favorite game but many nonFPS gamers also found it very enjoyable While later great firstperson shooters like the Ns Perfect Dark and the recent XBox millionseller Halo presented excellet FPS action with updated graphics to boot Golden Eye will forever be remembered as the firstperson shoot for the masses
If you need a reason to keep your N this is itGoldeneye  at first glance looks like yet another installment into the tired and outdated FirstPerson shooter game genre The big suprise is that it is so much more than a standard shooter or a bog standard movie translation
In a word Goldeneye is amazing It takes full advantage of the  bit technology and delivers a smooth fun and challenging adventure You assume the role of James Bond the secret agent who needs no introduction You run through various missions which tie into the movie and solve various problems and perform various tasks What complicates things is the number of guards who are ready to kill you on sight As expected you have a number of weapons at your disposal from the silenced pistol and machine gun to the grenade launchers and highpowered explosives The firstperson perspective adds amazing realism to this game with action and controls that are as smooth as James Bonds charm
The graphics are phenominal with smooth movements and amazing scenery This game really makes you feel like you are living the adventures The music is right out of a Bond movie and adds a nice edge to the action The controls usually quite clunky on that horrible N controller are easy to manage here After a while it becomes like second nature
For parents considering this game for their children they should be aware of the violence Much of the game is spent killing people and the realism is striking It is up to you but this is an excellent game that can be quite addictiveThis could be the best game of all time What else needs to be said If you havent played this game before and still have a working N you need to pickup this game If you havent played the game you can also find it on the Wii Virtual Console and an upcoming remake for DSWhat can I possibly say about this game that hasnt been said a million times
Perfection
Groundbreaking
Beautiful

Just some of the words that come to mind when I think of Zelda 
Zelda was my introduction to RPGs and what an introduction it was

The good
Everything
Graphics story pacing etc
Insanely difficult in parts I still cant beat the water temple without the walk through
And Ganon in the painting still has to be one of the coolest boss battles of all time

The bad
Nothing
One of the games that not only defined the N but a game that set the standard for excellence in RPGs

One of the bestever
Highest recommendationsThe Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is the greatest game in the entire Legend of Zelda video game series  Period

Nuff saidIll keep this short as most people have probably already played this but when this game released in  there was literally NOTHING like it no fully d adventure with the calibur of Ocarina of Time existed in those days the sheer quality of this game was unheardof in  the graphics were smiply beautiful for their time and the gameplay was near perfection

You start the game as a young Kokiri boy living in the forest village with your friends and the old wise Tree of Life when darkness strikes your small corner of the world its up to you to delve into the tree and find out whats truly hurting and potentially killing him after solving the situation in your home a much broader world of discovery and adventure opens up to you and its up to you to save Hyrule

after completing  childhood dungeons and playing the song of time in the temple of time you find yourself frozen in a time warp for  years waking up at age  i believe waking up in adulthood you make your way across  more dungeons before conquering the final fortress and facing one desperate final stand from the evil thats been behind all the trouble from the start

Truly epic in every way considering the year it was released Ocarina of Time is still the greatest game ever created in my opinion

This game may not have a lot of flashy features like sound or simulant multiplayer but who cares I bought this game in  and I still play it I recommend it to anyone who likes firstpersonshooters or a James Bond fanIf you like racing games that are unique this is for you You can race by yourself or with a friend Not only that but you can also challenge your friends in battle mode with some really fun arenas If your more of a solo player like me dont worry there are four different tournaments that you can play

You can even use different items either to slow down the other racers or to help you pass them up Of course every item has its own effects there are a few that are hard to get Thats because theyre special learn how to use them and the competition will be eating your dust

And last but far from least there is a special mode you can unlock for an even bigger challenge Yeah this game will keep you busy no matter how you play Its definately a musthave order it while you canAfter checking GameSpots authors note this was originally posted exclusively on GameSpotcom and a few user reviews I absolutely had to throw my two cents in I couldnt help but laugh when I read the introduction of Even with all its bells and whistles Mario Kart  is very likely to disappoint you after about a week

When I picked up this game initially my thoughts were SWEET A new Super Mario Kart I unfortunately never had an SNES of my own so my fixes came in the form of time at my friends house

This game is absolutely spectacular in every way Yes I do feel that it could benefit from maybe a higher difficulty level and there is also the fact that its possible to clinch a Gold medal in a circuit  races after finishing in the top spot in each of the first three races However other than these minor spots I find it to be flawless Everything from the graphics to the sound to the features are great There is also a great amount of multiplayer available in this with not only the up to four player splitscreen but the track ghosts as well Track ghosts are saved data of your best race single player only on a course The game saves not only your time but your entire race When you race against your ghost you can actually compare yourself secondbysecond on the tracks and this also helps you to analyze spots and what you did to help you become a better racer

The items are what really make multiplayer fun though Ive had many a time where I have something such as a ghost which lets you steal and item and makes you invisibleinvincible while my friend had a lightning bolt shrinks all opponents and its a quick reaction race to see who can get their item deployed first To me however there is nothing more satisfying than hitting your opponent especially if its a friend instead of the computer with a green shell a shell that fires straight out as opposed to the red homing shells as hes about to cross the finish line to win not just the race but the circuit as well And yes I actually did that to a friend of mine Talk about bragging rights

Up to this point I have kept or at least tried to keep retrorating out of this review and I was considering dropping one of the five rankings to a  because Im stingy with giving out perfect s If I had rated this game when it first came out it would probably be rated somewhere around  to  However there is one reason and one reason only that I still own my N  and that is to play Mario Kart   a decade later Note I cant even say that about Zelda OoT or GoldenEye That in itself I think warrants the move up to the perfect  rating  I guess this pretty much means that Ill have to give Super Mario Kart a  as well I guess well see when I finally get it on Virtual Console For those of you who ask Virtual Console Why Read paragraph 

Overall 
Gameplay 
Graphics 
Sound 
Value 
Tilt This game can keep you busy all day with excitement and fun Its even better when you play with other people Its great whether your playing with your friends or family Challenge them with different characters and roads This game is for anyone any age they will enjoy it I guarantee you will tooIt has spawned such classic levels as I recall such as Luigis Circuit Moo Moo Farm Frappes Snowland Toads Turnpike Koopa Troopa Beach Banshee Highway Bowsers infamous Castle Warios Stadium and the ridiculously long and bright track Rainbow Road which has spawned at LEAST  different versions throughout the series

My alltime favorite level in the game is actually Sherbet Land Its filled with ice and is just fun to cruise through And the penguins that you can run into are so cute

The playable characters are your basic eight Mario balance Luigi balanced Princess Peach lightweight Toad lightweight Yoshi advanced Donkey Kong heavyweight Wario heavyweight and Bowser the heaviestweight

This game is very VERY easy to just pick up and play with friends The controls are simple as all get out and the characters look pretty cool for a N game The sounds they make are cool too

If you want something that  guys andor girls can enjoy this is the right move

 PROS 
Bright colorful boards
Addicting sound effects
Semiinteresting characters
Fun tracks
Way BATTLE Nuff said
 Semiunique characters

 CONS 
Sound comes through in player or player mode but fails to when playing with  or  friends
 levels just isnt enough to satisfy the average gamers thirst
The music can be annoyingnauseating to some
When youre in st you get crappy items When youre last you get the best ones usually landing you in stndrd

Cons aside I spent countless hours with friends that I cherished playing this game It will bring smiles to your faces for months to come If you like this and own a Nintendo DS or a DS Lite shame on ALL of you who dont then I totally recommend Mario Kart DS also More levels and more mayhem Did I mention even more characters

 starsmario kart  is by far the best n game

if you want nonviolent racing with all the nintendo characters for a good price look no further

also if you like mario kart  you might like

First of allthis is an Action Adventurenot a RPGRole Playing Game

NextI recommend buying the Strategy Guide This game is what gamers call Nintendo Hard Its a challenging gamewith quite a number of puzzle parts

Anywaybuy it if you have a or Virtual Console it if you have a WiiWassup fellow gamerz  Nubs  Lulz

My parents just bought me The Legend of Zeldo Collectors Edition for my th birthday It features this Legend of Zeldo Oracana of Time game I enjoyed this game very mucheven tho the graphics suck I will give you some of my thoughts now

My favorite part was when the main character Link pulls the Supreme Sword from the stone in the iceberg temple Oh man Glammondwarf the villain was so cool He snuck into the Secret Realm behind Link and stole the Trueforce of Strength  Pwned

The Prince Zeldo person was really weird  Heshe was a tranny who turned into some guy named Shaieke who kept stalking Link on his journey Then heshe would change back into an elf girl in a dress What a creep  But Zeldo had the Trueforce of Smartness so I guess that character was okay Zeldo had this tall whitehaired ninja lady named Inca as a bodyguard Inca might have been a man too thoughIm not sure  She looked kinda like my aunt Helga

The Link character was really cool  Link wears white tights a green toga and had a grappling hook device He also has this little firefly thing called Navely that follows him around You begin the game playing Links little kid brother which kinda sucked  I cant pwn Goombas with a little midget Goombas are these big skeleton guys  I think the kid brother is supposed be Peter Pan after he killed Captain Hook and left Neverland maybe they have another game about that part

But later you get to play Link who is an adult elf with a pointy nose He has the Trueforce of Braveness so that means he is very brave He can throw dynamites into walls to blow them up and reveal secret buried treasures I wonder if the treasures were hidden by magic pirates  Later on Link gets the Bassoon of Time and can play it to make it snow I think Link is kinda mentally handicapped though because he never talks He just goes Ugh Hiyah AUGHHHHHH and stuff
I think he might be a cannibal or vampire too because he eats hearts to gain health There is a really annoying beeping sound that reminds you when its time to feed

You pick up these little colored diamond things called rublees that you can use to buy stuff with But they look really big so I wonder how Link can carry so many in his pockets And if you dont pick the rublees up soon enough they begin flashing and disappear I guess theyre likebig holograms or something like in Star Wars  Why are there so many rublees hidden in the grass and under rocks I really wish I could mow my parents lawn in real life and find money like that

There are these fish people named Zurros They have this giant jellyfish named Mr Jabba Jabba and you have to go into his stomach to retrieve an ugly little talking fishman I think it was the Zurro kings pet and he lost it But you have to carry it all around Mr Jabba Jabbas stomach so its kinda annoying

Then there are these big rock guys called Gordos that like to roll down mountains They are my favorites because they live in this mountain called Doom Mountain It explodes like a volcano and tries to kill you  Holy 

That evil Glammondwarf guy is a member of the Garundo thieves They are a bunch of ginger women that live on a beach But they dont have any men in their race so I dont understand how there are so many Garundos Maybe some of them are trannies like Zeldo  I think Glammondwarf might be one He kinda sounds like a drag queen when he laughs

Sooooo all of these people live in this magical land called Hirole with a bunch of weird cartoon characters I think its supposed to be kinda like Toon Town from Roger Rabbit Its such a huge place It takes forever to ride across it on Links horse Ramona Thats right You get a horse Link steals it from Mario and Luigi at some ranch So I guess Link is kinda a thief Maybe hes really one of those Garundo thieves He does kinda look like a girl  But hes not a ginger so Im not sure

Aaaanywayplay this Bassoon of Time game It is full of so much WIN  I hope I didnt give too much of it away  Lulzone  XD

wtkidThe Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is really awesome but how awesome Is it the best of the Legend of Zelda series so far Oh undeniably but that is not the point My point is that it was the best game for the Nintendo  with Super Mario  and its direct sequel Majoras Mask in a second place draw It shows how the franchise began Link sets off on a journey to save Hyrule from the evil Ganondorf for the first time He meets Princess Zelda on the way and when she flees from Ganondorf she leaves the Legendary Ocarina of Time in Links possession He uses it to travel through seven years with the help of the Master Sword The graphics were neat for the time the storyline was really exciting and there is a lot of stuff to collect The dungeons were challenging and the boss fights are neat If you are a fan of Nintendo please pick this up You will be glad you didThis is the best racing game ive ever played and the most funest The game has a cool unique to a racing game it is tons of fun and you can play either Mario Luigi Peach The Princess Toad Yoshi BowserKing Koopa  Donkey Kong There are three types of trophies you can recieve either the Mushroom trophy Flower Trophy Star Trophy and A Special Trophy Cool Hu Well this game was tons of fun i recomend it to everyone Peace Out

If you liked this game then check out all of the Mario GamesThis game is an old racing game but heckits better then half of them out now With all the crazy weaponsit can keep you goin awile This game is really worth it if u have a nintendo 

This is still  of my favorite gamesI came across this game in  and immediately recognized it from the cartoon from back in the s  I played it just to try it and I wound up getting so addicted I had to buy it for my N  I would stay up til all hours playing it  Its rare for a game to hook me like that but this is one that is challenging yet fun so you cant help but say okay Ima try one more time then Im turning it off and still be playing a couple of hours later
The Water Temple was the biggest pain for me because I tend to rush into things and wouldnt do things right as far as the puzzles went  I loved the Forest Temple as a kid  The weapons are easy to use and play a role in a fair share of what you do  The boomerang has a few uses such as getting items that are out of reach hitting switches and killing enemies  The ones I loved were bombs except when I got too close to them  lol
I dont remember much else about the game since its been a while since I had time to play it  I do know it took me quite a while before I managed to get some things such as all the Poes and Golden Skulltulas but no matter how many times I play this game it doesnt lose its appeal  Like I said its challenging but not so hard that you throw the controller down in frustration and give up
Its the second easiest game of the three Zeldas Ive played  Twilight Princess although very in depth was easy and Majoras Mask was the hardest but only because I kept running out of time when doing certain tasks  Ganon was hard for me to kill at first but I think now that Ive played it enough and therefore fought him enough I know what to expect and I can now anticipate what hes going to do and react accordingly
All in all I recommend this game even if the system it was made for is pretty much a thing of the pastThis and Super Mario  are the best games for this console Now this was the first Zelda game I ever played and its gold cartridge Now this is a zelda game thats good to bring in the newcomer or Link to the Past This game is not too difficult but difficult enough The story is one of the best stories Ive seen in a video game very original The one thing about this game I dont like are the water dungeons Its a trend in Zelda games to make the levels that involve water the hardest part in the game but it is passable

In conclusion good game for newcomer and the best storyline to keep you hooked on the seriesThis is one of the best and my personal favorites from the Zelda franchise The story was fantastic the gameplay was amazing for the time even compared to todays gaming this game showed less problems or glitches

There was hardly any serious problems with this game The playtime was a very good length and it offered a some side quests to do Each dungeon was well constructed and were not something you walk in and leave unhappy Some parts were frustrating sure but when is a game just so easy and you feel happy beating it

Puzzles in this game were I suppose challenging for  child but they were not impossible This is a great game for all ages and a great buy as wellI remember I was  and I had just gotten a Nintendo  At such a young age most of the games out were too complicated for me and I had to find something I could understand Enter Mario Kart  This game is pure and simple you pick a character and race with seven other famous Nintendo stars in  detailed for N anyway stages This was one of the Ns first games so for me it turned the system into a classic which I still play today

  This game was much better than Super Mario Kart and much better than Double Dash In this game you can choose from cc  cc which isnt much and depending on your speed this could be very boring or the ride of your life I mean seriously who wouldnt want to speed down Yoshi Valley at  mph For its time in  this game was amazing and I still play it today I am  now so it has an enormous replay value And the only stage I dont like is Banshee Boardwalk

  If you have a Nintendo  which not many people do then buy this NOWThis game is pretty darn easy  I beat most of the tracks with only a rental  Its not near as tough as the SNES version  Heck the SNES version of Rainbow Road had no walls around the track and the track was thin to boot  Rainbow Road is a cakewalk on this one  Wide the whole way with walls all around  Too darn easy  However there is a monster shortcut thats very dangerous to go for if you want to make things interesting

Even though it was too easy I bought the game anyway  Its fun to beat the heck out of these computer controlled suckers  Plus I really like the games ending

There is one hard level the one with all of the traffic in the extra mode  It can be very frustrating if you make a mistake because you get run over again and again and again  It usually takes away any hope of recovery

The most significant improvement over the SNES version is the time trial mode  You can race a ghost of yourself after youve already completed the course  The ghost is only a recording of your previous performance but it gives you a lot more motivation to beat your old time I assure you

Ive never been into multiplayer modes but if youre into that kind of thing youll REALLY love this game  Some multiplayer matches can go on for a LONG time since the levels are so welldesignedThis was the first Kart game quite like this there isnt any Kart game like this either outside of the Mario franchise If you think you can find a better Karting game out there Id like to see you find it and show me because from my finds and plays this is the only game that is worth playing From DK to Bowser Peach to Toad this game has most of the characters that have been involved with Mario in some way The graphics are great for its time the sound is fun the worlds are colorful the idea is great Who wouldnt like this game at ANY age Im not sure but if you dont you amy need to see a doctor This is the best Kart game ever and the best Mario Kart game everI love all the Mario Kart games this one has some of the coolest tracks  Yoshi Valley is the best track Ive ever played and the graphics are pretty good too  Small selection of characters if youve got the one for Gamecube but still a blast  Awesome  player or multiplayer game a must have for parties  Good anytime and thats hard to findMario Kart  is without a doubt one of the best games ever made for the Nintendo  or any other system Even today  years after its original release Mario Kart  is still amazingly fun The controls are PERFECT and I do mean perfect The first time you go power sliding around a sharp turn youll see what I mean The game is perfectly balanced each character has strengths and weaknesses Your skill determines if you come in first not because you picked the best character Oh and I havent even spoken about the brilliant course design Every course has shortcuts and special features making them truely unique The placement of the powerups is wonderful And the multiplayer Oh the multiplayer One word brilliant Playing with your friends is exciting competetive and will have you laughing like crazy This is what multiplayer gaming is all about If the game does have one weakness it is the graphics being  years old Mario Kart  doesnt stack up well against todays crop of games in terms of visuals But when youre having this much fun with a game do the graphics matter No way Even if you own the Gamecube version of Mario Kart you still owe it to yourself to pick up a copy of this timeless classicThis is one of the best games out for the N  The races and tournaments themselves are challenging and extremely fun  The many characters that you can unlock all have their own abilities and everything else to set them aside  The tracks are not repetitive and give each race a fresh new layer of fun
Multiplayer is an even better experienceWho could imagine that battles with cars and turtle shells would actually be fun  Well it is fun and will keep you playing for hours on end  This game will make your friends ask if they can come over and play  A sure hit with a gamer of any ageLike many other people I absolutely adore racing games and the Mario games  Then I saw this come out  It was perfect  It was a racing game with the characters from the Super Mario series  I was so excited to play it  My friends and I played it all night  It was so addicting  In fact I still play this game todayMario Kart is one of the more entertaining video games of all times It is suitable for all ages and can be enjoyed and mastered by the young and old player simultaneous play with a selection of  classic Mario characters and  different difficulties beat all curcuits in rd or better to earn Extra Mode and  levels of play each level containing its own unique obstacles and courseCool game But I think Toad is the fastest of the crew I used
to be an expert at it I was even born an expertFor Nintendo some of their most popular games have been revised over and over again In the case of the Nintendo  the case has happened to itself too The  Mario Kart  game is no acception The starting flag proves that the light is worth checking out
In this game you play any of eight characters in  traditional courses and  battle zones Choose from Mario Yoshi Wario Peach Luigi Toad Donkey Kong and Bowser The graphics are a bit more intact than the other racing games that came later for the system Although it might try to drown you out a little bit at a time when you complete the four racing cups quickly Luckily the game truly makes up for it in the Vs mode where you are headtohead n a battle with up to four players in the race
Mario Kart is absolutely worth checking out for the Nintendo  despite the fact the Nintendo  has no more new games for the system If you buy it only for yourself your better off bringing in a partner for the rideThis is an excellent game Once you start playing you cannot stop until you actually beat it This has averythingn a GOOD game should have Excellent graphics excellent gameplay good
player mode and good sound The only flaw in this game is well their are no flaws this game gets a SOLID  Thanks for reading my review Happy Gaming PS Dont buy Pokemon Snap ThanksMario Kart  the sequel to the first Mario Kart game on the SNES is great Nintendo got rid of some of the things that made the SNES title so much fun but added a lot too The gameplay is much more enhanced the characters look much better and the individual gokarts are very realistic
Like the SNES version this game includes  modes of play GP Grand Prix Battle and Time Trial In GP you choose one of  characters Mario Luigi Peach Toad Wario Yoshi Donkey Kong and Bowser in a large variety of courses in the Mushroom Cup Flower Cup Star Cup or Special Cup which you unlike by getting gold trophies in each of the  basic courses in cc cc or cc mode cc is the easiest but in cc and cc the computer gets much faster and more challenging There are several items you can collect by driving through the question mark boxes which help you during each race Lightning bolts the rarest item to get makes all of the other opponents small mushrooms give you a speed burst banana peels make one of your opponents crash if they slip on it red shells are used to shoot directly at an opponent to get them off course and green shells keep bouncing off the walls until it hits one of the racers Unlike the SNES Mairo Kart game there are several objects you need to avoid to stay on course In different races there are trucks and cars that will make you crash if you hit them snowmen that will blow up if you hit them and many other obstacles in different courses
In Battle mode you and up to  others choose one of the  characters You drive around a course trying to pop each others  balloons You can pop their balloons by shooting red or green shells at them or throwing banana peels at them to make them slip You can also use the other items to avoid being hit by them Once all of your balloons are popped you become a bomb which you can drive around the course trying to run in to the other players This mode is a lot of fun especially if you get tired of continually playing Grand Prix mode
In Time Trial mode you race in any of  courses and try to set records for each lap andor race
The controls for Mario Kart  are very simple and easy to master and the music and sound effects are great as well
If you want a great racing game for your N I highly recommend that you check out Mario Kart My favorite part of this game is the battle mode  My friend showed me all the tricks he has learned from playing it  Like where to set traps and other stuff  The one player mode is fun tooIm just sick of reading reviews that dont show mario kart of what it really did but ill tell you what it really did
Mario Kart was one of the first games out for nintendo and the first game that started series of mario games for n  Such as Mario party  and  also adventure games like super mario  etc  and many more to come
Mario Kart was so good because the tracks were so detailed yet not so detailed that the whole game is messed up because of it  And its just so addicting because its easy gameplay  And you cant say nutin bad about it
So if your looking for a good game for n that was better than any other mario game in history besides melee  This is the gameIf you liked Mario Kart for the Super Nintendo then you will love Mario Kart 
This is an amazing game One of the best for the  If you have competition around you can take up hours of play time
I have played this game almost as much as I have Golden Eye  but not quite as much If you are looking for a good quality game with a very high replay value then this is a great game to check out
Doesnt matter if you are  or  you can get into this game The multiplayer makes things a little bit more interesting The battle mode is the best feature if you have equal level competitionTruly a classic This game was one of the first I got for the N and it is one of my favorites today As it gives graphics that were hardly ever seen in the early N days it also has gameplay almost unmatched by the games of its era The sound is moderate but sound isnt a very big facter in deciding the rating of the game
  A followup on the early SNES version that was also a hit this game was certainly watched before its release date as it stormed into the N world and took many fans as you can see from its very high review in many chances right away It was considered as a very high class game then and now too Many of the N owners today have one in their hands and many of those have played the game for over  hrs
  This game has wonderful graphics and sound for the era that it was made in The size of a typical game back then but with the technical advancements of some of the games today The graphics are very good as you can distinguish all characters and objects faster than immediatly The game also shows no slow down rate no matter how many characters or items are on the screen at the same time  The sound is entertaining for a while and it is different for almost all of the  courses showing wonderful compositions with goofy sound added noises at parts
  The gameplay is also great You may pick one of  characters to race with On a small go  cart you must race on one of the  courses and try to get in first There are many modes You can race with a group of  racers in a grand prix mode where you may race a total of  races and accumulate points A vs mode race will put you against a friend or  or  in a single race There is also a battle mode which will put you against  to  other players where the last one alive wins
  The items in the game play a big part Some will boost your speed while some are used to slow down enemies Some steal enemies items and some let you do things such as go invincible or invisible Most of the however are used to smash your opponents into the air and slow them down In battle it will be used as one of  hits to destroy the enemy
  The characters are the typical mario game characters  Mario Luigi Peach Toad Yoshi Wario DK and Bowser They should all come in handy sometime in the game and it should be fun to test them all
  OVerall this game is great for having fun I reccommend it to any one Great for technology too This game is right for youMario Kart on the n is an extremly well made game when one person plays the game for the first time the controls are easy and you dont nead to worry about changing gears After you get better you can move on to harder levels of play once you beat the game on cc hardest level you can race al track in mirror mode all tracks have opposite turns then their original tracks the ads more replay value because the game in a sence has new tracks All the tracks are unique and have varied difficulty levels they are also well designed
The graphics in mario kart are bright simple and full of color the music in the game is not very good but it does not mater because of the great sound effects provided by the characters
As with all great n games this one accells in the multiplayer department It will appeal to people of all ages you can choose from  different multiplayer modes battle championship single race The most fun out of all of those is batlle because you go around getting items then try to hit your friends with any item you get if you hit youre oponent theyll lose a balloon they have  ballons
This is a party game i would recommend over any mario party game and definitly over didy kong racing this is a classic n game no one shoild be withoutThis game is one of two reasons to buy an N  Its excellent multiplayer with enough shortcuts and tricks to perfect thats its also a great solo game  If you have an N and you dont have this game then you should stop wasting your time and go out and buy it  You could play the other games but they are terribleMario Kart  is an excellent game I love the graphics the creators at Nintendo  made them very specific My favorite modes to play in are either Mario GP because I love racing against the computer or Battle because you have to be alert and careful not to run into in obstacles like bananas or shells I really like the ghost so you can see whether or not you beat your previous time with that course My favorite course is Yoshi Valley because in many areas there are no walls to keep you from falling so its a challenge and I like the big squasher egg The one thing that drives me crazy is the fact that the computer can manage to get in front of me while racing without me noticing or even knowing how they did it Other than that this is a great game with excellent graphics and fun for the whole family I hope you enjoyed my reviewPeople say GoldenEye was a much multiplayer than this game but Ive spent more happy hours racing my friends in Mario Kart  than blowing people up with proximity mines in the Complex in GoldenEye
Lots of people extol the graphics in GoldenEye but graphics in Mario Kart  is better First of all it has a lower polygon count and the characters look much better The gameplay is simple but that only means its easier to learn The card that comes with the game tells you everything you need to know so all you have to do is plop the game inside the console and start playing
So the characters dont say much Its mainly just a simple Yippee or Ima Wario and Ima gonna win but theres much more ingame speech than GoldenEye Sound effects are fine too The soundtrack is excellent It ranges from coutry to smooth jazz Even some major critics of video game music I know have said that the music here is great You know Koji Kondos doing something right hearing that
Mario Kart  is addicting with four players and it can be addicting with one player too The Time Trials may be a little disappointing but the Mario GP had me coming back for more
The game is one of the best racing games on the N Its better than WaveRace Diddy Kong Racing FZero X and even Excitebike  Heck its one of the best games on the N If you havent played this game then you dont know what youre missingThis is a really cool game I played this to death i dont know how many times sometimes alone and at times with a partner
Its really tragic if you dont have this game when you own an N you dont know what youre  missing out on
Umwell this game is pretty easy and you dont really  need a strategy guidebook for this one I think the only reason why its so  damn fun is because on every track and race you can race it differently  You can try new tricks or even attempt to create your own shortcutif you  are that good
Graphicswise its all a letdown i was expecting  realistic models but i got cartoony characters but then again its mario  and friends right
As a mario fan youll want to have this in your  hands and if youre not then play this as a party game It beats Mario  Party in replay value but is somewhat less challenging
So bottomline  its a little too easy But that will not prevent it from being a top   game of all time read EGM I bought these to use with band hero and with the voice games for xbox   It worked well plugged into the xbox  without any issues  The microphone worked properly and was just as seller had described  My voice is heard clearly on it and we were able to play both games usuing this mic  Great deal with the price  I would recommend it out of  people will probably see this and pass it up as another cheap RPG for one thing you only have  dungeon gasp when you leve you level back down to  GAsp and you capture monster just like in Pokemon GASP  No its not a compelation of rip offs this is a classic that is highly addicting and incredibly fun if given a chance
The story revolves around a young lad you name who on his fifteenth birthday is given the opportunity to become a hunter and explore the depths of the Monster Tower to retrieve riches however to do so he must not only survive but grow as a trainer and as a man  In comes the Kewe the monster you will likely use for a majority of the game  He is a fire type there are only three types and he is your brief tutorial and key to success early on
  YOu also must build up your respect to the townsfolk to do this you must enlarge certain places Temple Hospital and build new things Library Gym Casino Race Track Bowling Alley ect and the town will grow to respect you
Now as for the tower itself there are  floors everytime you leave you go back down to level   No its not immpossible for two reasons
A Your monsters level stays the same when you leave this is due to the fact that they are more like equipment
B Weapons and armors stay the same when a red or blue sand is used your weapons and armor grow more powerful so technically you can easily dominate the first few levels without you monsters assistance
Overall this game is tricky you will die the first few times lose all your items except monsters  but once they are strong enough you can succeed  There are  randomly changeing floors and they get more and more difficult as you go along  YOu must adjust your mosnters accordingly by class
AFire
BWind
CWater
Fire beats Wind Water beats Fire Wind Beats Water
I would buy this for the challenge it possess guarennteed addictionThis game for all that it was was fun exciting and enjoyable  While some aspects of it are repetative it is fun and I had a blast
You are a monster tamer in the tradition of your father  You must make your way deeper and deeper into the mysterious tower near town to find fortune and achieve your destiny  Each trip into the tower puts you at the beginning  but your animals retain their skills  You also can keep weapons and other items you find but if you die they are lost
It is at least worth a rental if not a buy  I give it five stars because it kept me very entertained and I have been disenchanted with most of the SquareSoft games lately  This really picked my spirits up  If you dont mind a bit of repetition you might not find this so bad
You are also given quests to find objects in the tower as well as the opportunity to build up and improve almost every building in your village  Perhaps the best and most amusing part is how several women vie for your attentions and you have to find the particular way to make them fall for you
Not necessarily replayable but great for at least a test driveI got this game when it first came out which was a couple years ago but Im just now writing the review strange isnt it  This game is what makes having an N so great  The graphics are just sweet  The story pretty much follows the movie and alters a little things to make it more enjoyable for us gamers  This game is very easy to control  Thats one of the best things about it The controls are placed if logical places and its better than the Turok controls  The best part of this game is the multiplayer  Its what made the game so famous  Killing your friends has never been this much fun  Ill never get tired of one of my friends walking in a hallway unsuspecting that a proximity mine is waiting there to take his digital life  The best multiplayer level has got to be the facility  But Ill let you the buyer decide for yourself  Another game I recommend and thats probebly better is Perfect DarkAlright this will most likely be the only time i will ever give a N game  stars but for Goldeneye i eill make an exception Ok Goldeneye was s jump into the world of high tech video game systems but unfortunately they couldnt keep it up This was a very solid st person shooter excellent graphics  and not even repetitive secenary what more could you ask for in a game The weapons were great maybe a little exaggerated at times but over all good Long levels and lots of them made this game excel in the lasting appeal category Sound was good but not having the cd quality sound os a PS or a DC hirt it a little Unfortunately Goldeneye got a little smack in the face when everybody started comparing it to the flopped Perfect Dark game But overall a great game and even though i am a die hard Playstation fan i still have a place in my heart for GoldeneyeThis game offers it all  Shooting action adrenaline pumping duck and dodge fire fights rescue missions covert action gadgets evil villains story and plot and a lot of weapons  I reccomend this to any gaming fan  Buy this game right now  You dont know what youre missing if you dont  The game also offers an incredible ammount of replay value with dozens of cheats that can be activated by getting record times in levels and also two levels that can be activated by beatin gthe game on different levels of difficulty  All in all a completely amazing game  Buy it  Dont hesitateNoteThis is the Gamecube Collectors Edition versionI remember ten years agoseeing the commercial for this game I always did wonder what it was like After getting the collectors edition I immediately got started on it The story focusesas alwayson Link Link is a young boy living in the Kokiri Forest One night he has a nightmareand wakes to discover a fairy named Naviwho will help him through his journey He is overjoyed but then discovers that the gaurdian of Kokiri Forestthe Great Deku Treeis dying from a curse The tree passes along a Spiritual Stone and recommends to see Princess Zelda Link does so and Zelda tells him to get the other two spiritual stones so Link can get the Master Sword to stop GanonKing of the Gerudosfrom entering the Sacred Realm and stealing the Trifocea divine relic Link achieves the other stones and the Ocarina of Time Link draws the Sword and finds out he has been tricked by Ganonwho entered the Sacred Realm Link awakens seven years laterand after discovering he is now an adultmeets Rauru the Sage of Light According to Rauruthe only way to defeat Ganon is to awaken the Five Sages That is where the true quest begins Wowwhat a story Nowthe graphics are not bad by todays standards Neither are the dungeons They are amazing And also very complicatedPlease dont mention the Water TempleOverall this game can be summed up by one wordPerfect Buy the gamebecome the heroand have the time of your lifeI remember when my parents bought this game for my older brother in the s It brings back so many memories and my brother and I still play it even though we beat it many times My brother would play it every day trying to beat every obstacle and this game is truly fun when my brother let me play the game I was hooked I did need some of his help on many things but that didnt bother me from having fun I enjoyed this game and anybody will I usually dont like these kind of games but this game is amazing and I love to play it Nintendo  truly does bring back memories and their games are fun tooWhat isnt great about this game Im so glad that this game has so many reviews because it definitely deserves it Ocarina of Time remains one of my favorite videogames of all time Yes the generation of gaming is getting wider and graphics are getting beautiful with each console but The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time on N doesnt add up to them Well at least to me it doesnt Ive seen a few  star reviews about people bashing the game only because its no everquest or Halo This game is so good that you dont compare its style or graphics with something in todays modern gaming This is an old school game You just dont compare old games to new ones I believe theres a favorite for every generation This one happened to fall into the N genre when gaming was really starting to pick up And honestly you think over  star reviews were written all by children We were children when we all played the game And looking back as adults now we cherish it as a classic and one of the best in videogame history Kids that didnt get to exprience the NES SNES and N missed out on a great gaming genre and though the generation of gaming today is awesome theres nothing on the classics

Ocarina of Time remains my favorite game of all time even before some of my new favorites and theres nothing like turning on that N and playing over and over again I never tire of this game It is a true classicFans of any oldschool dungeon crawler should snap this game up In a similar style to other games of the time you assume the roll of a monster hunter with a mission to climb a mysterious tower following in your fathers footsteps

Some may say the graphics are dated I feel that they are nostalgic With randomlygenerated dungeons spelunking is always a grand adventure A musthave for any RPG loverI was actually thinking about this game a few months ago and it was killing me that I couldnt remember the name  This game was a ton of fun though Im sure if I played it now I would laugh at how dated it is  If you have a way to play this I recommend it  I blew a lot of hours on this game and would gladly pick it up again if they made it available for download on the PSLet me put it like this if I had to destroy every videogame I own except one this is the one I wouldnt destroy This is simply the greatest game ever made Im not going to insult this game by trying to describe the storyline or graphics etc You have to experience it for yourself Most helpful thing I can do is tell you how you can get to play this This game has had dozens of ports One came on a bonusdisc for Gamecube with Windwaker in  and another came in a collectors edition Master Quest also for gamecube If you cant get ahold of one of these the original for N or a ROM you should buy a Wii and download it from the Wii Virtual Console It will be worth the whileI have played many many many video games in my life and this game is literally the best game that I have ever played in my life Its nice and long like all the other Zelda games It has a perfect level of difficulty there are so many different weapons in the game there are so many memorable dungeons and fields in the game well I could go on forever I wish I could give this game a higher score than the measly star rating Amazoncom forces me to give but alas i cannot If you own a Nintendo  BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW If you dont own an N you can still buy it for gamecube its the same exact game I own it for both N and Gamecube If you like this game then buy the sequel too Its called Majoras mask Im telling you you will definetly not regret buying this game if you are a diehard Zelda fan Or even if you are not a diehard Zelda fan Although I dont know who would be reading a review of a game that was made in nineteen ninetysomething in  IF YOU ARE READING THIS BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW AND IF YOU DONT YOU ARE MISSING OUT  Everything about this game is perfect That is allBack in the late s I wrote two articles for a now defunct game website about Ocarina of Time One is a review of the title and the other is the how in many ways Ocarina of Time feels like a remake of the eternal SNES classic and my personal favorite Zelda game THE LEGEND OF ZELDA A LINK TO THE PAST Rather than leave them unposted I issued them on Amazon back in  one article on the Collectors Edition Zelda  a Remake and and one on the Regular edition an actual review of the game When the DS version came out I wrote a review of that and included both articles on the review as well for bonus content Originally this review only featured one of the two articles  I am now putting both articles up

Mike London 


This commentary on Ocarina of Time was written as a gaming article for a retrogaming site back in May of   I was going to post it on Amazon but for some reason never got around to it  Mike London November  

Article  Does Zelda  really live up to all the hype

Blurb With all the hype its hard to be objective about OoT  Is it the best game in the series or does it have to settle for second or egad third best  Is it like Star Wars Episode I all special effects and no substance  Find out a few thoughts from a fellow gamer

The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is easily one of the most hyped games of recent gaming history  In fact I think I could safely say it IS the most hyped game yet  There is only one thing that can compare to it in terms of hype and this product is in an entirely different industry  Star Wars Episode I had the same amount of coverage  Being a big fan of both of course Ive beat the game and have seen the movie  And they have one thing in common  Theyre both eye candy  But how do they hold up to the rest of the series  In my opinion The Empire Strikes Back is by far the best Star Wars movie  But what about OoT you ask  How can I defame such an instant classic

One reason mainly  In the original and in The Legend of Zelda Link to the Past I cant speak for Zelda II because I havent beat it yet the ending was spectacular  Not the game ending for The Legend of Zelda was produced in the Stone Age and there was much ending wise but the last dungeon  Ah the last dungeon  Only recently like December   have I beat the first quest of The Legend of Zelda  That last dungeon on Death Mountain was a killer a true challenge that you had to match your mettle with to get past it save Princess Zelda and beat that nasty ol Gannon  It was truly a great dungeon  Now skip on past those five years between the release of the original and the SNES version  What have we here  A dungeon comparable to that in the original Legend of Zelda  Everything is bigger and better in the SNES version including the last dungeon  Whew and I thought the original was harder but no way

Then in  we see the release of the Game Boy version of Zelda  The Legend of Zelda Links Awakening was released to a very receptive crowd  But guess what  No end dungeon  In terms of dungeons this is the smallest of the Zelda titles again not including Zelda II  You beat eight dungeons and then you go and beat the Wind Fish  Personally Im half a dungeon away from completing this Zelda game Dungeon Seven which I completed half of went and beat eight and now Im back on the last half of VII  That last dungeon was challenging granted but what about that classic end dungeon  No where to be found here  Granted its a Game Boy game and it is huge for that consol  So that offence is not to serious  And we did get a new dungeon though not the ending I was hoping for with the Colour Dungeon on DX which was the rerelease of the classic game for Game Boy Colour

After five long years The Legend of Zelda Orcarina of Time was released for the N  So cool  Link in a D adventure  About time too  Mario the cash cow counterpart to Link got his D adventure way back in   Of course I bought the game  And of course I beat it  It is an excellent game  Truly it is one of the great classics  But one flaw keeps it from edging out The Legend of Zelda Link to the Past  The end dungeon absolutely sucked  That is my only disappointment with that game  As I was nigh the close of the Shadow Temple I was really looking forward to getting into Gannons tower  I was expecting a great closer dungeon just like in Link to the Past

Spoiler If you havent beat the  version of Zelda dont read this

What did we get  Instead of a great closer dungeon we got a door way that was blocked by barriers  What did we have to do  Go thru six rooms and beat whatever was in them then go and shoot the barrier corresponding with each temple to open the pathway  And what did I get  A great disappointment  Sure this might have been a good way to end a novel or something but to end a Zelda game like that was horrible  The Game Boy was forgivable and acceptable but this ending to Zelda  was truly despicable  That has been my biggest disappointment with the Zelda series

Spoiler Finished

Others say The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is the best Zelda game  I have to disagree  Dont get me wrong  It is easily one of my favorite games of the N  Its a great game very innovative espically that nifty Z Targeting feature and an epic in its own right  But for what the system is capable of The Legend of Zelda Link to the Past beats it out of the coveted title of Best Zelda Game  LTTP is huge  It fully utilized the SNES technology  It had a full twelve dungeons two of which the sole purpose was to beat the bad guy and not try to retrieve any medallions or crystals or pendents or pieces of triforce or what ever  Thats one more than the original has  LoZ has one closer dungeon for each quest  After you beat the bad guy twice you go and fight Ganon  There were plenty of side quests for an SNES Zelda also  Overall for the systems capabilites LTTP is my favorite

But what about The Legend of Zelda OoT  My two chief complaints are these
    Weak closer dungeon as I spent a good time detailing up above
    Not enough bad guys to kill in the Overworld

All other Zelda games including the black sheep of the family Zelda II has plenty of bad guys to kill in the Overworld  But what have we in OoT  A few measly skeleton dudes at night and some giant flying plants that you can hardly get too in Hyrule Field  Give me the old Zelda with bad guys streaming at you in every new screen  For all the time they put into it you dont think it would be to hard to correct this problem

Then we come to another mistake Nintendo made in the N version of Zelda  Granted LoZ had two main tracks one being the Overworld theme and then the dungeon theme  They could have had more variety but it was back in the Stone Age  That Overworld Theme became pretty much the theme of the entire series  And guess what they decided to omit music wise from OoT  The Overworld them from the original LoZ  I couldnt believe they did that  Hopefully well see it in Zelda Gaiden  Maybe the Triforce will show up in that game too  Just a thought

Now after railing on OoT for a great majority of this article you may think I hate the game  Quite the opposite really  Its a great game and worthy to be in the Zelda Series  Gee it sounds like Im defending Zelda II which Ive already done in a separate article  But it has been the single most hyped up game in the history of Nintendo and it is totally out of balance  Great D game but would have been better had it corrected the problems I stated above  Its a fun game and I had a great time beating it  It provides a lot of enjoyment  But just like Star Wars Episode I it just cant live up to all that hype  I wonder if any game or movie could actually

May    An article originally written for NintendoLandcom  Ive written four released articles and one unreleased article dealing with SMB   It will have to be edited  Also perhaps incorporating part of the structural symmetry article

Zelda  a Remake

Blurb Zelda  and SNES Zelda has several similarities almost to the point that the basic game design of Zelda  is a remake Read here for more information on this intriguing phenomena Just a few thoughts from a fellow gamer

After playing the course of The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time Ive noticed something very intriguing about it It seems to be a rehash of what I feel is the best Zelda game LoZ Link to the Past Why do I say this I say this because there are several structural symmetries that lie between Zelda  and LTTP

Lets examine it For one there are three pendants you have to acquire in LTTP This is after you go and rescue Zelda and leave her at the temple Well this time around you dont rescue Zelda but you do go and talk to her After that when you get the three pendants you go and she is kidnaped This is after you get the Master Sword in the Lost Woods In Zelda  you go thru the first part of the quest getting three spiritual stones After you get those three spiritual stones which I think the tower on LTTP is much better than that d Lord Jabu Jabus belly I hated that dungeon  you go to the town Guess what as Link approaches there it cuts to a cinema and Zelda is kidnaped by Ganondorf Hmm    havent we seen this story before It turns out that you have to get  of the Sages medallions Rauru conveniently gives you one so we can cut the sixth one away Only by getting the six sage medallions can you open the bridge to fight Ganondorf How intriguing

In the superiour SNES Zelda counterpart it is seven crystals and you dont get one given to you Link wakes no sages this time Instead the seven maidens of the wise men descent have been hidden in deep dank dungeons and Link has to transverse thru  dungeons all together  the first part and eight the second part They are challenging fun and intriguing Granted Zelda  has some great stuff But it is not as consistent as LTTP After you have gone thru the seven dungeons two more than in Zelda  you now have all seven crystals Thats great Now go to Death Mountain and by doing so you will open the way to Ganons big bad temple

Okay what do we have in Zelda  You go and get the five medallions plus the one that Rauru gives you as Link Guess what Now you have to go to his tower and open the rainbow bridge with the six medallions Hmm    isnt that what we did in SNES Zelda Why I do believe it is Watson

Another issue yet addressed is the Light WorldDark World Zelda  does the same thing save this time it is time traveling Im not even going to go into the impossibilities of time travel on this    thats a whole separate article in itself In SNES Zelda you have a little mirror the old man gave you There are eight transporters located thruout Hyrule transporting back and forth If you are in the Dark World you can use the mirror to go into the Light World making a temporary transporter Well in Zelda  there is no mirror or transporters the closest to a mirror is the Lens of Truth found nigh in the Shadow Temple But if you go and put the sword back then you go back to being young That creates two versions of the same world to explore That structural symmetry corresponds to LTTP Not only that but at the end if the first three stones Link goes to the Temple of Time and gets the sword This is after the three Spiritual Stones goes into place Hmm    isnt that what happened in LTTP After getting the three pendents Link goes to the Lost Woods and retrieves the Master Sword But he cannot do that until he has all three pendents Well thats the same in Zelda  He cant get the Ocarina of Time now can he retrieve the sword until he wins the corresponding three spiritual stones I swear Ive played this game before      

The real question is why did Nintendo do this Well Miyamoto is a great gamming god but as far as stories go his team is not that good at having connecting story lines that make sense Again another article another time The structural symmetries lying between Zelda  and LTTP is quite frightening Who knows why they chose to do that Granted the story line is different but quite a few of the fundamentals behind both pieces are indeed the same In review

A Listing of Structural Symmetries between SNES Zelda and Zelda 

 SNES First Part Link goes and retrieves three pendants after rescuing Zelda This is to get the Master Sword Upon doing so and after giving the Pendants up to retrieve the Sword Zelda is kidnaped

 N Link after receiving a mission from the Deku Tree goes and wins the three Spiritual Stones Upon doing so he goes to Hyrule City but not before learning Zelda is kidnaped He places the three Spiritual Stones in their place and the Door of Time is opened and there the sword is Retrieving the Sword goes to the Temple of Sages or whatever it is called Is given first Sage Medallion

 SNES After winning the three pendents Link must now go between two versions of the world Light WorldDark World Link must go back and forth between the two worlds to beat the game

 N In this great stunning adventure Link must go between two versions of his world One is when he is young the other when he is an adult This is achieved by putting the sword back in its pedestal Just like in SNES LTTP Link have to go back and forth to finish the game
When he is an adult things are noticeable more evil for Ganons power has grown

 SNES One version Light World is good because not corrupted by Ganon Version II Dark World is an evil corrupted version of the Light World

 N One version Young Links world is not corrupted by Ganons evil Ganon has just recently showed up Version II Adult Links world is an evil corrupted version albeit older of Young Links world The only difference is in one its two different versions of the same thing in Zelda  its the time barrier But for game play theyre the same

 SNES He Link must recover seven crystals hidden in seven dungeons sounds logical With the maidens power they will open to door to Ganons castle

 N Link has to recover five medallions to open Ganons Tower

 SNES The massive closer dungeon is a tower

 N The weak closer dungeon is a tower

 SNES After beating Ganon you save Zelda who had been kidnaped Although one could argue you save her in Turtle Rock she is still imprisoned in the Crystal with the other maidens each in their respective Crystals

 N Sticking to the standard Nintendo story after recovering the medallions and beating Ganon guess what Link saves Zelda Theres a shocker

 SNES There are various minigames heart pieces and extra things to do This trend is continued in Links Awakening also

 Zelda  Stuck with the trend of minigames four heart pieces to make a heart and extra things to do

 SNES In some of the houses you can find a picture of Mario on the wall

 N In Zelda  after meeting Zelda look out the window and you can find some pictures of Mario Luigi Bowser and the Princess Yoshi also comes up Malon and Talon wear Bowser amulets also Just goes to show Nintendo likes cameos

As you can see for yourself the various structural symmetries between Zelda  and SNES Zelda is quit a few If Miyamoto wanted to do a remake of LTTP for N thats what he should have done I suppose This as far as story goes is pretty much an update with little changed Its like they took the games basic plot changed the circumstances and added where appropriate but allowing the basic structure to stand And although both are great games sadly SNES is better consistently with each dungeon getting a little harder and more complex But I love Ocarina of Time all the same This just helps support my believe that Nintendo is first and foremost a gaming company not a writing company

In all previous Zelda games the end dungeon was in the mountains This is the first game in the series to break that trend The first three Zelda I II and LTTP their dungeon was in Death Mountain Links Awakening Links only Game Boy adventure currently is in Tal Tal Mountains At least we have something that broke one of the several trends running thru this classic seriesthis game is a real gem  treasure it and treat it well it is worth any priceLegend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is one of my favorite games ever  I just love the storyline and the characterseven though Link Ganondorf and Zelda have been in all of the Zelda games but this game is the best  The original Legend of Zelda for the Nintendo was okay but it felt like the game would NEVER end  I recommend this game to fantasy lovers who also love the idea of a super villan an actionready hero  This is also one of Nintendos classics  Everything a fantasy story needs is right in this gameThis is one of the best games I have ever played  Even shooting the arrows is fun you can actually use your shield to block getting hit  Just incredible  The only bad thing I can possibly say is you almost have to buy the strategy guide or else you will likely get stuck on some levels  There are a few dungeons that I could not find my way out of without buying the guide  But overall great gameman i remember getting this game when i was around  years old and alll those hours i spent beating this game over and over again I Gurantee Ive beaten this game at least  times Honestly Though the N is outdated from time to time I take it out of my closet and plug it in just to play this game I hope the twilight princess will be just the sameUnless youve been living in a box your whole life chances are youve heard about what an incredible game this is Nay I will go as far as to say perfect Even if you havent grown up with the Zelda series youre still likely to find this game quite enjoyable Its safe to say that this game was nothing short of revolutionary and it continues to be one of my favorite video games of all time

The story begins as a young Link awakens in a small tree hut Staying true to past games you start off with no items or weapons You soon learn that the Great Deku Tree wishes to see Link and thus you set out to explore Kokiri Forest Upon taking your first steps outside you meet the elfish inhabitants of the forest While you search the area for a sword you have time to get accustomed to the controls and the environment Once you have sufficiently explored the forest and gathered the required items you head for the Great Deku Tree accompanied by your faerie friend Navi After completing this first dungeon the Deku Tree explains the history of the Triforce and rewards Link with the Spiritual Stone of the Forest thus setting the story in motion

The graphics of this game are fantastic for its time You can now journey through a fully navigable D map The details of the environment properly capture the mood of each setting be it a forest village a watery temple a haunted underground maze or the inside of a giant fishs belly The map of Hyrule is pretty expansive and full of places and objects to explore The cinematic sequences look great and tie the segments of the story together well

I absolutely love the controls in this game Everything is pretty intuitive the A Button is used to execute actions the B Button swings your sword and the C Buttons allow you to store up to three items to use during play Youre able to roll and jump swim and climb block attacks stab and build up power for swing attacks But the greatest addition to the control features is the Z Targeting ability This function allows you to lock on to people and enemies and focus a particular action on the targeted object Moreover this button will focus the camera directly behind Link allowing you to have control over your point of view To this day I compare games camera controls to Ocarina of Time often wishing for that very desirable Z Targeting capability A great addition to your supply of character controls

The story itself builds upon previous games in the series for we interact with familiar characters like Zelda and Ganondorf in addition to many new individuals As always there are a whole variety of weapons and items to collect during your travels some that are familiar and some that are new to this title What makes this game even more engaging is the idea of traveling through time You begin the story as a child growing as a warrior and searching for the Spiritual Stones When you travel into the future the world has become darker and your missions more challenging There is a constant interplay between the past and the present as you try to make your way through the dungeons and numerous side quests The multitude of puzzles games and items to collect makes this story very immersive and entertaining The endearing characters that you meet provide for a rich enjoyable plot furthering your adventure along with their dialogue and aid

And the game would not be complete without sound Again Ocarina of Time gains a perfect score here The sounds that Link makes when he fights moves and interacts with others are both enjoyable and believable The echoes that your character makes are varied depending on what type of environment he is in Likewise the soundtrack is just as appropriate Each level has a different musical score and each song blends in beautifully with the surroundings Also some of the songs are familiar tunes from the previous games transformed just right for a sound that is nostalgic yet new The ocarina songs are appealing as well adding another interesting component to the gameplay Ocarina of Time really has a wonderful soundtrack and even today I still enjoy listening to it

All in all this game is truly a classic and yet another impressive sequel in the Zelda series From the sensible controls to the superb storyline to the awesome soundtrack Ocarina of Time is a gem in the adventure game genreThe Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is a definite Classic Ive owned this game for a good  years and its just extraordinary and fun but at the same time educational In this game you must do alot of thinking and find out where the secrets are So in other words its a magical adventure game

The graphics are actually good for its time and the gameplay is easy to get used to The controls are also simple and the whole storyline is just well thought out and I can definitely tell that they put alot of time into this game In my opinion its the best Zelda game so far

Now I will tell you the beginning of the Story so you can even feel more excited about getting this game

As a young baby boy your mother was killed by an evil person Now you have no home and have to move to a place called the Kokiri Forest This is a place where people never grow up and arent allowed to leave the forest Theyre called the Kokiri But youre different You really dont belong in this forest instead you belong out in a world called Hyrule Youre a Hylian normal people who actually grow up Youre out there to defeat Ganondorf Ganondorf most likely the person who killed your mother is a strong and evil person who wants to take over Hyrule and become the King The only person that can stop him is you Link Now the question is will you be able to defeat the mean and evil Ganondorf and save the world of Hyrule

If you think or know you can take that responsibility then I suggest that you buy this game along with the N if you dont have one and experience something very special Like I said its a definite Classic and will keep you entertained for hours on end You wont regret it

Thank you for reading and I hope I was helpful enoughThis game has crossed the I Like You line Its just like the old one from NES although I know about the dungeons and the weapons because I have the old one So its fun to play for a while until you get to the Water Temple it gets confusing there So use the Players Guide to cheat so that you wont get stuck I played a long time ever since it came out It was the game that caught my eye and though I had to have the game I am a Zelda fan and I hope that you have fun playing it as well I just like to see Link grow upThis Zelda game is simply amazing The Wind Waker sucked and Four Swords was OK but this game rocks The main plot was spectacular and the gameplay was great I first played the game after getting Collectors Edition for Christmas and I was addicted to it The main plot throughout the whole game is that Linkas a kid must collect  Spiritual stones and open the Door of Time along with the Ocarina of Time As an adult Link must awaken the  sages and fight to destroy the evil Ganondorf and rescue Zelda I have beaten the game  times it was so good I highly recommend it to big Zelda fans NOTE This game has a sequel called Majoras Mask but its not near as good in my opinionlike all zelda games the ocarina of time provides an adventure about link a young heroin the ocarina of the player takes control of a young boy known as link right from the start of the game players jaws dropped at the sight of the graphics for  bit graphics it looks amazingas the story progresses players obtain more items and link becomes more of a hero at about  thirds through the player becomes an adult and he cant use some of his items which is one the most impressive features in a game iv ever seen Its about an ancient evil being restored and a child giving up his youth for his country theres nothing bloody wrong with this game its perfectpsthis game is why you keep your nAlthough I like the SNES Zelda best you really cant make a game better than this one  Sometimes a game is made that goes above and beyond  stars  This game is like that

A vast amount of items all found in unique ways  Awesome  Lots of giant evil bosses  Awesome  Lots of underground hidden stuff  Awesome  Lots of weird folk to talk to  Awesome  Time travel in a HUGE mythical world  Awesome  Lots of minigames to play for cool prizes  Awesome  Just so many awesome things packed into this ONE game  I usually only recommend rentals but a rental wouldnt do this game justice  You have to buy it you have to beat it and you have to find every secret  Live this game and every now and then live it again

Ill also recommend buying some kind of strategy guide or looking for tips online to find everything  Ive heard that there is a giant monsterous eellike fish in the pond but I have yet to catch anything like thatThis game is the best game on my n next to nightmare creatures this game feels like final fantasy with Kingdom hearts it was the best selling game on the n If you still have one you should pick this one upI love this game You cant say that you are a Zelda fan if you dont own this game This game features an awesome storyline unforgettable characters and just keeps getting better You could play this game forever and not get tired of it If you have a N system you better own this game Or if you have a Gamecube you should have the Legend of Zelda Collectors DiskThe most recent LoZ games in my opinion have all been fairly average  Wind Waker was the latest actually good LoZ game  But of all the LoZ games OoT is just plain incredible

In this game you play as Link as he grows from a child into a young man while on his quest to defeat Ganon and save the world from ultimate evil rule  Along the way you meet many friends and face amazing boss battles

The graphics at the time were just incredible  It really made me enjoy looking at and playing the game  Nintendo really did a great job in this department

The gameplay is like no other  One of the few incredible games to utilize the C Buttons for vital controls this game felt really comfortable to play and theres tons to do in the game besides just beating it  Also throughout the game you are forced to travel back and forth through time and play as Young or Adult Link to complete the game which is aweinspiring in my opinion  Sadly after doing little everything theres no addictive minigames to really play and not much else to do but go through the game again and again

The sound is incredible and the music has never been better  I found myself turning the volume on the TV all the way up while playing this game because the sound was that good

If youre an avid gamer yet youve never played this game then somethings really wrong with you  Pick this game up and play it till your fingers fall off which I guarantee youll do  This game is worth buying and owning for as long as you even are aliveThis is the best game I have ever played It has very good musicgrapicsand the story is great I really love this gamebut the only really big problem with this game is that it has this onelong and boringtemple that is very hardandpleasedont take this game lightlythe bosses are hardbut the story is so good that you will want to play this game again and again But the other Zelda games are lame So only if you want tobuy this game and maybe the legend Zelda A link to the past  PROSthe story is greatIts a fun gameand the great fairysFairys that will power you up and give you new weapons are easy to find  CONSswitching around the camera is a little bit hardand finding the goldskull tokensgold coin like tokens that you win from beating spider monstersis easy at the beginning of the game but hard at the end  This is a great gameso I would recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy gamesI would also recommendfinal fantasyIII dawn of soulsandThe legend of zeldathe wind wakerBY FAR ONE OF BEST ZELDA GAMES OF ALL TIME I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME WELL WORTH THE MONEYIll make it shortI hope

Im not particular a fantasy lover I never read Tolkiens Lord of the Ring I hate the Lord of the ringmovies and was insulted by the numerous Oscars the films received
I despise the Star Wars movies especially The Return of the Jedi which has that peculiar fantasyfeel in it
Blahdieblahblah

Now with games its a different story I dont know why but Im much more forgiving and willing to accept a world where fairies gnomes and other creatures excist
The Ocarina of time is one of few artistic highlights I encountered in my lifeits almost ridiculous when I think about what Ive just wrote what about literature art and cinema

This game moved me so mucham I a geektheres so much depth in this piece of art
It isnt the story alone cmon lets be honest its an average fantasy tale if made into a movie Id fall asleep after  minutes
I think its all the pieces put together a beautiful crafted world the progress when playing  from a child into a young man  the challenges youll face and overcome the music that playes a big role in the game the use of time day and night future and past etc etc
It grabs you and most important its interactive duh for its a game youre not watching a crap fantasy movie but playing the hero all by yourself when he looses you loose etc

I played a lot of games in my life including many newer titles as Halo GTA Metroid Prime etc etc and I didnt yet played a game that matched the sheer brilliance of The Legend of Zelda  The Ocarina Of Time
Best game ever so farThere always comes along trend setters that some how cannot be bettered Zelda is one of those games its challenging enjoyable adventurous fun i loved every minute of it even though at times i wanted root out my hair i have no regrets having this game in my collectionone of the best games ever on 

even though the  era has ended if you are a die hard gamer from time to time you may want to go back this game is definitely worth playing again and again theres always something you would have miss that you can find the next time aroundLegend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is a classic  It should be played by every Nintendo fan and fans who are not big on Nintendo  The Zelda series is infact a big popular series but this one defys all of them  Ocarina of Time is a stand alone Zelda classic  It is not only the best Zelda game but it is possibly the greatest game ever created on a console  The story line is oh so brilliant and the graphicseven for todays standard are unbelievable  Anyone who owns a Nintendo  needs this game  This game is pretty old and pretty cheapI lost my game so I baught one for  bucks at Gamestopso it wont be hard to find  This game infact shows what the Nintendo  is capable of  The game is very well made as you play through a huge worldwell not that huge  And I will say thisI may be exagerating this though But the Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time has one of the best boss battle finale ending everUbelievableGraphics in this game a superb  There were parts in the game were I would just stand there and stare at the ocean houses anything cause it looked so beautiful  I loved how they created the bosses especially the last one and it was amazing how realistic they made the horse look  Nintendo scores big with the graphics  The gameplay is magneficent  I loved how it was all made and done  I really cant get into this one youll just have to play this part for yourselfThe sound isMy godIts beautiful I even downloaded all the songs  I loved the song were your in the temple and you get the Mastersword cause they made that song really well  The music in the farm were Epona is was made extreamly well and was just BRILLIANT  As Ive stated the story in this game is just plain good though it obviously has the save themed plot as you all know and I wont really get into the plot since there is already like  reviews saying what the plot is aboutSure the game is old and outdated I guessBut so whatThe game is still one of the greatest games of all time  Ill put it in simple words for you the game is flawless  The game has an amazing plot that will suck you in the gameplay is fun and classicas well as riding Epona the horseand music is just plain beautiful the enviroments and atmosphere of the game as just as incredible as the game itself is and as I stated beforeOcarina of Time is simply the greatest video game ever madeand if its not possible then it has hands down the best video game ever made no the best video game OF ALL TIMEGet this game you will not regret it

 out of if I could I would give it  out of Ive beaten the game  times and Im still not bored of playing it If you havent played this game then PLAY IT you wont be sorry you did This is much better than all the other FINAL FANTASY and rpg crap out thereSince Amazon is sort of combining Ocarina of Time and Majoras Mask into one review I will write a review for both games Both games have been remade for the GameCube and I own both the original N version and the GameCube version The gameCube versions were released if you bought a GameCube at a certain time and if you preordered the Wind Waker

THE LEGEND OF ZELDA OCARINA OF TIME
This game started out as you as the Hero of Time You were the only forest child without a fairy and the Great Deku Tree sent the annoying little fairy to you When you go to the Deku Tree he says you must get these Spiritual Stones to open the Door of Time and a bunch of other crap like that

Sound and Music  This game has one of the best scores in the video game world and the ocarina songs are very good  credit to the music makers of all the Zelda Games these are some great songs The only problem is you cant shut it off Sometimes it gets annoying and it doesnt help if you are stuck on a level for hours

Graphics     In this day in age the graphics are so good these look like horrible If this game was released today everyone would laugh Back in  these graphics were the best out there But the good thing about them is you can see the faces unlike some of those games fromt hat time it made you go blind

Difficulty  This game is HARD I beat it barely without a strategy guide and you can be stuck on levels like the Forest Temple and the freaking Water Temple for MONTHS If you beat the game with a strategy guide you take the challenge and fun out of it You also wont have many broken items like controllers or TVs

Gameplay   It is considered the best game ever and was the  Game Of The Year You could do EVERYTHING in this game and it is very fun doing all those side quests and other crap This game is like no other No other game can match this none of that Final Fantasy or any other RPG match it it is the best Nintendo game ever made

THE LEGEND OF ZELDA MAJORAS MASK
The game takes a huge turn in Majoras Mask as young Link goes out with Epona from Hyrule No Ganondorfs in this game because it revolves around Majoras Mask a mask stolen by this little imp from the Happy Mask Shop guy from OOT You have three days to get the mask back but you must keep going back using the Ocarina and the Song of Time

Sound and Music   It is like a carbon copy of Ocarina of Time and the suspensful music is very catchy The game has great music ALL ZELDA GAMES HAVE GREAT MUSIC

Graphics Same As Ocarina of Time

Difficulty  Not as bad as Ocarina of Time but that doesnt mean it is not frustrating and challenging You cant be scared away by the challenge of these games because they are just too great

Gameplay  The whole mask collecting concept is very fun and it a change from beating Ganondorf like in all the other games You will feel deja vu of Ocarina of Time because the characters are the same just different The game is fun and a great challenge Overall these games are classical N greatsZelda OOT is centered around a massive circular field called Hyrule Around this field are pathways which lead off to various different locations such as dungeons castles villages volcanoes etc Each path will lead to usually one destination like a castle and once explored you travel back across Hyrule field and visist another pathway which leads to a different location This makes areas more accessible and it makes backtracking as less tedius as possible due to the fact that youre not endessly travelling through preexplored ares Backtracking is an important feature of OOT due to the fact that when you progress through the game you aquire objects which give you the ability to explore areas more thoroughly  bombs for instance blow up walls that hide secret paths Hockshots give you the ability to ascend to higher ledges The Ocarina of Time opens secret doors Thus pre explored areas which you thought were unimportant can in fact conceal the most important instruments and dungeons in the game This is compounded when at one point in the game you aquire the Master Sword This is a special sword which upon claiming makes you and the world age by seven years and by doing the reverse putting the sword back in its mold makes you and the world  years younger The good thing about this is that the past and future are profoundly different The future is controlled by evil whereas the past is controled by good Needless to say your mission in the game is to liberate peice by peice the future world from the evil Ganondolf However in order to do so you must travel back and forth in time creating situations which will have an impact on the future world

A main part of this game is the ocarina of time Depending on what tune you play the ocarina will turn night in to day make it rain open secret doors or make blocks disappear amoung other things  This adds an important layer to the game for you have to use your brain in order to work out which song is necessary to progress For instance after spending hours wondering what to do the idea could suddenly hit you Should I play Zeldas Lullaby in front of the waterfall If successful the waterfall will stop and a passageway will display itself thus giving you a tremendous satisfied feeling The actual songs you learn in the game are some of the best songs in computer game history In fact only Computer World by Kraftswerk can compare to the greatness of the music in OOT

By the time Zelda OOT was released the difficulty in games was just perfect Your heart was racing when you met a worthy adversary you were fustrated when you died you were delighted when you succeeded Fustration and anger are both necessary in games because its those feelings which make you truly delighted when you succeed  Unfortunetly since OOT games have become so easy that a huge part of the joy in completeting them isnt there anymoreI love this game  I love this game  I love this game  I just got Ocarina of Time and its been a few years since it has come out  it still rocks even in comparison to whats out now  Ive had a Playstation  for a couple of years and have had a good game here and there but after playing Ocarina of Time I realize that I had forgotten the beauty of Nintendo games  They just have a special feel to them and they make me remember the years that I was a little tike playing old Nintendo games  I just beat the game about  minutes ago  I certainly wont spoil anything but I will tell you that the ending is over  seconds long and is something worth playing through the game to see  A video game hasnt brought me this level of satisfaction in a while  Bravo Nintendo bravoTHIS GAME IS AS GOOD AS THE SOUNDTRACK AND MAJORAS MASK IT IS ONE OF THE BEST IVE EVER PLAYEDI bought this microphone for the game Michael Jackson The Experience to sing the songs My niece and nephews love it As soon as it arrived we hooked it up right awayThe Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time may be difficult at times for some of the temples were designed to make you think but this game is the best game I have ever played in my entire life
I have been playing nintendo for years and I have played some of the older Zelda games before but I never owned any as soon as I tried this game  I immediately loved it and Ive played it millions and millions of times  I am so obsessed with it I went out and preordered the Wind Waker to get the Zelda bonus disc and renewed my subscription twice to Nintendo Power to get the Zelda Collectors Edition disc
There is no need for me to review this game  all I really need to say is buy it  You will not be disappointed if you are a nintendo fan or have a brain  Definitely be sure to get the follow up Majoras Mask and the Wind Waker  A must play and Link is the best hero everI got this game a couple of years ago and I was completly shocked it was really fun and addictive but takes you into a new world called Hyrule Throughout the story Link has to save Hyrule from Ganondorf who makes Hyrule look like the Devils mountain But if Link collects the right items he might save Hyrule with the Princess of Zelda
Graphics  The colors really standed out with the houses grassland people etc
Gameplay  It was a challenging game might be hard to follow through in controlling but Ztargeting helps you alot Using new weapons such as swords sheilds bow n arrow hookshot etc was usfull in beating
Storyline  The story was copied by the old Zelda from Super Nintendo but made into a more better world More places to explore and more side quests to do
Overall  My opinon I thought it was a game that everyone even Zelda fans should get it for your collection Once you beat it you can actually go for more side quests items to get and other things you missedThe Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is simply put the best adventure game I have ever played Im a newcomeer to the Zelda series so Im not too sure how Ocarina rates with the others but I love it For an Nintendo  the graphics are absolutely beautiful The lighting rivals that of a Playstation  or Xbox or Game Cube The sound is terrific Each different sound effect was done in detail The sword against stone and the sword against wood are not the same as in a lot of games and sound just like they should The echos when you enter the room and the monsters roaring in the distance are incredibly realistic and Links footsteps are done perfectly The puzzles are challenging but not so that you want to through the controller down in frustration but so that you wont put the controller down until youve figured them out The minigames and the sidequests will keep you playing long past the time youve beaten the game itself because they are so plentiful The controls take some getting used to but are perfect for the games combat system The targeting especially helps the later you get into the game The music is captivating and is very well done Overall I think this is one of the best games ever not just in adventure Its definetly a game anybody with a Nintendo  should haveThis is truely the best game for  becuase link is so cool This is probabaly the best zelda game Ganondorf is the man and you beat him in this game If you havent played this game i dont know but anyways in this one you could be big link and little link Not like in majoros mask where you could only be little link This game is way better than majoros mask If you still have  get a gamecube so you can play windwakeryou need to get this great gameOcarina Of Time is definitely the best game on the Nintendo  Super Mario Perfect Dark and F Zero X are awesome but Ocarina Of Time is the best out of any other game on the system What else is there to say about a game that changed the way we look at Role Playing games foreverThe graphics are awesomesome Game Cube games dont look this good the music adds excitement and the challenges are excellent Whereas the difficulty in Super Mario  stayed pretty much the same throughout the game Ocarina Of Time gets harder when you get to be a better player Also you get an extra heart after beating bosses because youll need it Its very challenging I still havent beaten it and am not sure if I ever will Easy games can be a lot of fun but they just arent as substantial as a game like this The challenge makes it fun as well as the graphics and controls Its just a great game and is a must for any Zelda fan or just someone who loves challenging gamesThis game is defently one of my top favorite games I dont have it but ive rented it and it is cool Your constantly under presure and near the end it feels like theres no where to go In this game you shoot arrowsfight theifsget a horseventure in caves and much more challenges like deafeating the power hungry sorcerer Gannondorf deffently  stars Im planing on buying this game todayReally though could an old out dated game still be awesome  years later  The answer is yes because this game is just too good  It gives you a complete story on Hyrule and the Triforce not to mention the best video game music ever especially the boss music  Being able to play as young link and adult link in two similar yet in a way completely different worlds as one would find out sooner or later  The graphics are still and when this was released it was the best game graphicwise as well  The bosses are easy yet in a way challenging and the dungeons and temples are amazingly designed  However there are two faults one minor one somewhat major
Link is missing the strap on his frontside that holds his sword case thingy  Well it just kinda looks odd
The final boss is far too easybut dont be too sure of thatThis last year of  ET did a survey about the best video game series ever Zelda one there poll and this game is one of the reasons why
Ocarina of Time tells the continuing story of the Zelda universe In the Zelda timeline it takes place before the other games As usual you are the hero Link You must save the princess Zelda You have different quests you must finish and many obstacles that will block your way The story is that Ganondorf the evil wizard is trying to take over the world Equipped with the Ocarina of Time you will travel time in your quest to save Zelda Hyrule and the world
This game is jam packed with stuff to do Id say you have a garunteed  hours of gameplay It has all the classic Zelda weapons and more You get to ride a horse across the country side and do some impressive underwater work There are just so many impressive factors
I love this game I cant thing of words to describe how good it is If you have an N your collection is not complete until this game is put in itThis title might be the best game ever The best title for the N it is beyond any doubts
 Graphics I havent played much N but for all I know this is the best you can get in the plataform Beautiful enviroment landscapes welldesigned characters different places and detailed textures for this plataform The graphics are hot I mean it And you didnt even need graphics this game would be great even without them This game will be forever known because it has changed the world of games with such D graphics plus the lockon camera this game will be forever reminded because of that Approved graphics
 Sound This game has the best soundtrack ever if you ask me Nearly every song in this game wins a  score I really want to find a soundtrack for this game because both the Ocarina songs and the ingame songs are awesome Characters dont have voices except when they scream when theyre scared and this kind of thing so the voice acting isnt great But the sound wins a  because of the nearly perfect soundtrack
 Fun This game touches you with a great story great characters great songs You really feel as if you were Link in the beautiful land of Hyrule and that makes the game so good that you cant say its not fun When you feel like the character you just cant stop playing even in the boring parts in other words the Water and Fire Temples The different times you play and the many secrets hidden I mean it many secrets I highly doubt you can get them all makes the game even greater even more perfect
 Educative I really dont know why this game is rated E for Everyone I feel like the game has some scary parts in other words the cemitery and the Shadow Temple so it should be rated T for Teen even though it has no great violence no red blood just green blood sometimes But you parents shouldnt worry about that This beauty must be taken to your children
Overall theres nothing to say I dont know what youre doing reading my review if you havent played this game yet This is one of those games you must beat during your lifetime The Wind Waker the last game in the series is very good but it isnt nearly as good as Ocarina Of Time It might take a long time for you to beat it if youre always busy because the game is not short but you must try Itll be an unforgettable experience to be Link in HyruleThis is one of the best games I have ever played  I love the gameplay  It was easy to control the character  I also enjoyed how it wasnt a very easy game  When a game is challenging I play it more and more  In fact I still play this game today  Very good gameThis game is blew me away I didnt expect Ocarina to meet with my standards after playing the previous Zelda games  They usually go stale and predictable but Ocarina didnt do that  Its a game for true fans of the adventure genre  The dungeons are long and perilous there are numerous sidequests a great cast of characters and a large world to travel  If you have any doubts about this game eliminate them  You wont be dissapointedWith almost three years in the making how did The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time stand the test of time itself As a prequel to the entire Legend of Zelda series it has caught heavy anticipation Ocarina is a prequel to the events before A Link to the Past Link is a child whose destiny is to save the land of Hyrule from Ganon Gannondorf here by traveling through time Youll meet up with other characters in the adventure and interact will fellow Hylians Kokiri Zoras and other civilations who aid you on your quest to save Hyrule Ocarina of Time is one of those controversial games that the series has carried all along In the end the game is an ActionRPG and should never be classified in the style of traditional turnbased RPGs like Final Fantasy
New additions to the series are automatic jumping and Ztargeting The emphasis of the Zelda games has always been puzzlesolving and dungeon arrangement You also build your attributes receiving items including the Ocarina learning songs whose purposes range from teleporting to opening doors to time traveling Along with minigames hidden items and side quests equal its a worthwhile experience Graphicswise Hyrule never looked better and most effects in Ocarina of Time are outstanding No need for sharp visuals and smooth framerates but rather focus on detail and designer talent The realtime cutscenes and the passing of day and night are impressive The sound also holds its own on this cartridge format The themes of Zoras Domain and Gerudo Valley are music to the ears Zelda fans will remember tunes of Kakariko Village and Zeldas Lullaby A big plus is that all the sound effects from previous Zelda games have made a comeback
In the end The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time makes the cut Even though the gameplay consists mainly of dungeondwelling and puzzlesolving the impressive graphics quality sound and everything thats been obtained from previous Zelda titles will keep fans and nonfans alike entertained Its funFirst off this game is very good considering it had very good graphics for an N and sound Second of all the storyline is the best Ive seen in ages The boy from the woods that no one knows becomes the Hero of Time I would reveal more but I do not want to spoil the game Third the gameplay and controls are easy to master so you probably wont be swinging your sword at an enemy when you intended to throw bombs at it like games with complicated buttons  Fourth the thing that makes Zelda well Zelda The dungeons The puzzles in them are chalenging and fun The scenery in the dungeons and everything else is amazing Fith the enemies are unique and mystique making the worlds you explore even cooler Overall this game is THE top must have of the N gaming system From a graphics standpoint this was and still is the best Legend Of Zelda ever The story was great as well as the gameplay All and all this was a great homecoming for the Hero of Hyrule Great game from beginning to end  starsWow What can I say As Im writing this review the popular  consoles right now are ps gamecube and xbox I have all of those Yet no game on any of those systems are better than this This is probably the best zelda everI have yet to buy the one for gamecube Deciding between this and Majoras mask is a tough call but I think this one gives a little more gametime
  How should I begin to describe this game Its deep engrossing and the graphics are spetacular for a N Yes the newer games right now definitely have better graphics than this but this game beats all of them in terms of gameplay music and theme The story is old but hey its a classic formula Why change it What would Zelda be without dungeons This is one of the few rd person games Ive played with great controls The ztargeting system can change a traveling mode Link instantly to a combat alert and maneuverable Link The music fits the moods perfectly from the dark shadow temple to the light and cheery music of the lost woods its great Buy it its worth your money and its probably the best game ever for Neverything a video game is supposed to be Lots visually diverse landscapes and effects intriguing gameplay and endless oppotunities for exploration within the framework of the game No boring moments here The horse is certainly a nice touch being a bit of a horse fanatic myself Provides a fairly lifelike representation of horse riding Nice soundtrack and the interactive music play was quite satisfying All in all a well designed game Wish they were all this goodIf you have an N you absolutely should have this game Its a remake of the classic Zelda game from the good old NES and SNES systems with some added twists new terrain and interesting characters
If you have a GameCube I would recommend you preorder The upcoming title The Wind Waker and if you do this right now Nintendo is offering a special deal where you can get a special release of Ocarina of Time for Game Cube Not just the good old Ocarina of Time made famous on N but also an enhanced version called Master Quest Make sure to put both into your shopping cart and enter the correct code while checking out to capitalize on this great value
Happy HuntingIm not even that farI just got past those guardsbut I can tell this is a classic example of electronic excellence and is a classic that anyone lucky enough to know its out there can discoverThis game is truly phenonemonal From the amazing graphics for what it is a N game to the music to the challenging gameplay to the engulfing storyline the Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is a mustplay for any age You start the game off as young Link or whatever you want to call him who lives in an enchanted forest where young never grow old Inside the forest there is a godly tree who could be considered to be infinitly wise The tree senses Link has the power to overthrow a great evil which is arising and tests him to the dungeon inside of him Link comes out sucessful and the tree tells him the story of the great evil which is arising From then on you play young Link and must overcome many obstacles As a child there are  dungeons and the trees counts as one so youre making some time right WRONG Theres much more to this game then beating dungeons As a child you cant acess as many of the things but after you advance  years to the future and attain the Master Sword many of these things are then open to you As a child you got an ocarina in which you must learn songs on to access special places or do special things Now you can do all those things and more My personal favorite is Eponas song in which you place a horses Epona song and it comes to you in which you can ride across Hyrule Field to get to places twice as fast As a child you have weapons like a stick whoopey a sword a shield a slingshot and Duku Nuts As an adult you can handle  swords the Master Sword and the Giant Sword which is so big you must handle it with  hands which means no shield You also have the hookshot Megaton Hammer bowandarrows and magic crystals you can do different things with I cannot begin to explain how amazing this game is Id buy a Nintendo  all over again just for this Now I have a Playstation  and I still have my Nintendo  but only play two games on it this of course and Super Smash Brothers Now do yourself a favor buy this game and experience teh magic yourselfThinking back on the times of Zelda have got me thinking The game was absolutely breath taking I remember how fun and exciting it was and it was so good because of the challenge If there is still anyone who has not played and beaten this game please get it it is totally worth the money Then in  or  years you too can think of what a great game Zelda was but then you will feel bad for neglecting your Nintendo  and playing your PS but PSs time for neglection will come in a few years alsoReading magazines from  one thing you couldnt escape was a some kind of mention of Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time It was all over the place Popping this in my N when I took it home I spent literally  hours just exploring Kokiri Village just cause it was so fun But then I realized oh yeah theres more to this isnt there And thats when the fun started
Graphics Although you can probably debate this this has one of the best graphics youll find on the system Lot of areas just drop that wow factor like when you first enter Zoras Domain or the games many cutscenes
Sound Although theres no voice except for Navis annoying Hey and an occasional Hello from her or Links grunts its got some awesome music One thing I love is the short ocarina songs you play such as Song of Storms Zeldas Lullaby and Song of Time plus general area music Although the overworld music isnt like what it was on Link to the Past its still great
Story The story starts off with Link having a bad dream about a mysterious man and woman Then Link is summoned to the Great Deku Tree where he fills Link in on his quest and it goes from there Even though it can be a quite simple story its just a huge epic story that kept me interested
Gameplay The infamous ZTargeting system thats spawned several developers to use it in their own games The recent Star Fox Adventures uses this Your CButtons are for your weapons B is your sword and A is your action buttonTalk Jump Climbetc Youll know this system by heart cause Navi tells you how many times about it within the first hour Camera is excellent and the Z targeting helps
Even though you might be able to find this I suggest you pick it up Dust off your N and dive into what is one of the s most critically acclaimed and commercial masterpieces everYou must own this if you like games Its spectacular in every way perfect It creates a breathing world you care about and love while having this awesome deep story and AdventureThis game rules It was very well conceived The storyline is good and the gameplay is awesome I rented it before and found out it is a game to buy and play Trust me you will get your moneys worth Good graphics excellent sound scores huge worlds and good characters pull this game together I am yet to find a game that matches its surperiority even Majoras Mask wasnt as good Ive beaten it several times through and sometimes wish that I didnt know it like the back of my handThis is a game you could fall in love with When I first played it immediatly after it came out I was so engrossed and enchanted with it that it was like the real world disappeared and there was just me and the game This never happened with me with a video game before The scenery is breathtaking and some of the music scores are beautiful although I think the music in the first forest dungeon as an adult is absolutely creepy The dungeons are puzzling at times but not too hard and the bosses are challenging enough you may have to try them several times but dont worry you can eventually beat them The game has a built in save feature so you dont need a memory card and you can save anywhere in the game dont have to wait for any specific save point that is real nice
You start out as a  year old boy and then after  levels you travel through time and become an adult Hyrule has changed and you need to save the land You go through many levels and bosses to finally get to Gannon the ultimate evil here He is an improvement on the previous Gannon of previous Zelda gameslooked like a little pig then and fighting him is more challenging and engrossing in this new game There are other little side adventures thoughout the game to entertain you when you want a break from dungeons and monsters This is a high quality game fun for kids and adultsGo out and buy it and play it yourself and see what I mean ok The levels are great and there is alot to do The places that you go are in the mountains lakes valleys and in caves and a little ranch somewhere Link lives in Kokiri Forest
In the game you have to get three stones somewhere One in the Deku Tree and One in Goron City and One in the Zoras Domain Some time in the game you will be older by the time you look around the place will be dead
You as Link and you have to save the world form evil form the evil king name Ganondori and his evil plans before its too late And save a beautiful princess name Zelda And you get to meet other characters in the game too some are cool some are big and some are small
Buy the The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of time Official Strategy Guide its a big help to me and you if you with it

  I think The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is even better than most playstation and playstation  games It is just that good to me
  If you ever see this game in a store buy it You will have a good time with this gameHey all you people this game is an absolute good Barely any flaws and it is like you are playing the game in reality This is a  star game Why you ask This is the proof
 Gameplay It takes you a while to master the controls and stuff but with practice this wouldnt be frustrating at all
 Graphics Great As I said everything is D like the Deku Tree and Link himself Take a look
 Lifespan I heard that people who knows Zelda games really well could beat this in a week But you guys out there that is starting a new adventure would last forever for no boring parts of the game There is a lot of words to say but its worth it
 FunThis game is a  fun game in my opinion of course I am stuck on the Deku tree of how to get past the spiders See challenging and fun
 SoundYou gotta be kidding me The Sound and music is great Different sounds occur in different environments for the better
Listen Closely
 Overall This game is an absolute no miss game Guranteed This is a good game who likes RPG or collects Zelda Games This is I think better than Majoras Mask This Game Follows the Legend HonestlyIm what gamers call a Zelda Veteran  Ive played almost ALL of the Zelda games and managed to beat only one this one  I love the Zelda games because they are challenging different and fun to play
  In this one Link lives in a forest with the forest folk  Link is soon inside the Deku Tree to defeat the evil monsters that moved into the tree  After a battle with the queen spider the Deku Tree sadly dies and tells Link to find Zelda the Princess of Hyrule
  Hyrule is a kingdom thats always in trouble and its up to Link to save the land from a terrible enemy  Link has the help of Navi a fairy that gives you advice or tells you what you should do next
  During his adventures Link will learn spells be swallowed by a huge fish and saving the land from the evil Ganondorf  This game is a classic and worth the moneyOnce again Hyrule is being threatened by the forces of evil As Link the chosen hero you solve countless puzzels and fight many many monsters This game has about everything Good graphics great gameplay and a wonderful story
Ganondorf the evil in the game needs to get the tree spiritual stones to open the Tempe of Time He threatened the people who have them but they didnt give him the stones Link goes on quests to get the tree stones Once he gets them and Zelda the princess gives him the Ocarina of Time  he opens the Temple of Time But little does he know Ganondorf followed him
Seven years later link wakes up and Ganondorf rules Hyrule He spreaded five of the six medallions and had monsters gaurd them You get the only medallion Ganondorf didnt have and go on a quest to find the others
This game is great and has a wonderful selection of weapons and other things I highly recommend it and for anyone who has a Nintendo  get this game for your  collection isnt complete without itI remember all the hype surrounding The Legend Of Zelda The Ocarina Of Time like it was just yestarday The Zelda franchise has always been among the best to grace any video game system and with the power of the soontobereleased Nintendo  the series was finally going to reach its next step the third dimension This along with other titles like Super Mario  and Mario Kart  got both gamers and the press excited about the N and the upcoming Zelda game While the Nintendo  never quite managed to live up to all its prerelease hype The Legend Of Zelda The Ocarina of Time managed to not only live up to its respected hype but in many ways surpass it
What makes TOOT special IMO is the fact that it is the first game that Ive played where you truly feel like a part of its world Many games tried hard to accomplish this feat including previous Zelda titles but TOOT was the first game to finally get it right Even the later Majoras Mask never quite managed to create the immersive world TOOT did
Much of the games feeling stems from the interactivity of its world You can spend hours exploring a certain area and still have not seen everything there is to see For example many of the games locations have these hidden holes you can jump into and find hidden goodies as well as hear some pretty haunting music Once you obtain the Stone Of Agony however you find out that these randomly placed secrets are only the beginning I wont go into too much detail here since you need to play the game for yourself to really appreciate it Another thing that makes this game feel more realistic than previous Zeldas is character interaction Remember how decidedly generic a lot of the NPCs in Zeldas II and III were In TOOT each and every NPC is given at least some sort of personality so that you can easilly distinguish himher from the rest of the games characters as well as once again feel like youre a part of Hyrule And of course the third dimension the dimension we live life through helps the game a great deal
The gameplay is equally great I especially liked how you can hold three items at a time rather than just one which is especially helpful in the games dungeons which often require you to use several different weaponsitems Speaking of which the dungeons have some of the most clever puzzles and interesting layouts of any game I had ever played And I really liked how once you completed all the puzzles in a dungeon you opened a new path from its starting point straight to the final boss rather than simply having to run through the entire dungeon all over again after death the way you did in previous Zeldas this was especially annoying in A Link To The Past where the dungeons were much longer and more challenging than in the original Legend of Zelda And of course the games graphics are among the Ns best not necessarely because of how detailedrealistic they are but how carefully crafted and full of life they are and the soundtrack is among the best ever to grace a video game even with the Star Fox quality midi samples
In brief The Legend Of Zelda The Ocarina of Time is an excellent game If you own an N and have not already picked this game up I strongly suggest you do If you do not even own an N than the systems worth picking up just for this one game and its semisequal Majoras MaskTHIS IS THE MOST ABSOLUTE SUPERIOR GAME EVER MADE You have almost no limits as to what you can do and there is always another secret or trick you can learn Not only this but there are no limits to the fun you can have with this game I enjoy the challenges and puzzles and new items and moves you have to get If you are going to buy a game for Nintendo  this is the game to buyBefore I played this game the only other Zelda game that I had ever played was Link to the Past and I couldnt understand it that well  I decided to play this because of the hype  I was sure glad I did  This is one of the best games ever  Its full of adventure it has a wonderful story and it is challenging  It begins with Link a yearold Kokiri child of the forest who is chosen to save Hyrule his home world  Along the way you meet new friends such as Princess Zelda and grow into a yearold adult to fight the evil Ganondorf  You have many different weapons spells and items at your disposal including swords bows and a giant hammer  The fun never stops and the story never goes flat  If you want a grand adventure buy this game  If you like this play The Legend Of Zelda Majoras Mask but wait until you finish this gameI have to say this is the absolute best Legend of Zelda so far  But there is one thing I have to clarify THIS IS NOT THE FIRST LEGEND OF ZELDA  The first came out on the NES and is Great to play  This one has good control fun plot and will get you so wrapped up in it youll come screaming back for moreThis game is just sickeningly good and nothing else since has matched its gameplay depth charm design and atmosphere It is absolutely flawless and perfect
When it came out  years or so ago i was hooked to it immediately and i finished it in about a month But since then i finished it around  more times and i still enjoy playing the full game today after  years It is that good The controls are absolutely perfect and the targeting system works perfectly for most combat situations
 The atmospehere of the levels of the game is just the best ever in a game to date For example in the mysterious forest the Lost Woods u can actually feel its mystery from the excellent music getting louder as u reach its source and the way the whole place is designed
No videogame fan has an excuse not to play or own this Words cannot describe my love for this game Sounds stupid but its true You will so nostalgic even when u meet the characters again for the th time It is just a gaming masterpiece and i doubt it will be bettered for a veeeeerrryy long time to come unless the new gamecube zelda follows the same direction and improves it with a larger interface and new fresh ideas
BUY IT it or u will miss out on the best game ever yes the best game ever  all i can say is if u havent for some reason BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY ITIn this one of two installments in the Zelda series for the Nintendo  you once again take on the persona of young Link or whatever you choose to name him as he embarks on a quest to save the land of Hyrule from the dark forces of Ganon  One of the great conflicts in Nintendo history second only to that of Mario and Bowser  You start the quest as a boy and end up as a man  Along the way you will fight many monsters explore dungeons and temples rescue a horse great for traveling through the world of Hyrule quickly engage in numerous side quests and minigames learn many different tunes for your Ocarina pick up a number of weapons and other helpful items meet some gorgeous fairies and in short have a wonderful gaming experience
As with the other Zelda games this one is filled with different puzzles of various types most of which you MUST complete in order to advance in the game  They are engaging but not too difficult to figure out for the most part  There are a few though that I had a tough time with  Not to fear though there is plenty of help out there both in books and on the internet to aid you through those difficult spots  The controls are wonderfully intuitive  Navigating through Hyrule is much like controlling Mario in Super Mario  and the game does at times suffer from awkward camera angles like Mario did and there are good tutorials in the game itself that teach you the ins and outs of fighting monsters and defending yourself
The Ztargeting system is excellent once you get used to it  You dont really need it for some of the early monsters but by the time you become an adult it will be essential  In addition you have a little fairy buddy Navi who continually travels with you and is always willing to give you helpful advice on what to do next after you complete a given task  Navi will also help you with advice on the weak spots of the many different monsters you will encounter throughout the game
As I mentioned before there are a number of side quests throughout the game  Theyre not essential to finish the game but they are a lot of fun and some of them will get you prizes that will make the later stages of the game a little easier  One word of advice  when you reach Lake Hylia be sure and talk to the two scarecrows  Later in the game you will be glad you did  Also be wary of purchasing too many items in the various shops and bazaars  They have many useful items but they are also VERY expensive and almost everything in there can be found for free in various nooks and crannies in the game  Also be wary of Gorons who want to sell you a Giant Sword  Dont say I didnt warn you
Although you do not NEED a Rumble Pak to play the game your gaming experience will be enhanced if you get one  The Pak will be set off whenever Link gets near a secret area which are sprinkled liberally throughout Hyrule  These secret areas contain goodies that you really dont want to miss out on
All in all an excellent game which showcases the abilities of the N to great effect  Games like this are why I will always remain a Nintendo fan  But dont take my word for it  pick it up  Youll be glad you didThis is by far the best Zelda installment yet Much more fun than Majoras Mask mainly because you can freely explore the world of Hyrule see review of Majoras Mask
This game can be fun for anyoneOk I figured Id throw in my opinion as well Mainly this review is for people who have not played the game yet and are wondering if they should Perhaps you arent too into RPGs or whatever so it is my job to convince you First off its more of an RPGadventure combination since it doesnt use conventional RPG techniques like turns or experience But that is a good thing because the way the game is structured allows for neartotal freedom as you play it Yes like some people have said you must beat the dungeons in a certain order but there are about a million other things you can do whenever you want and that just expands the boundaries of this game even more It is truly the greatest game I have ever played that is no exaggeration The graphics and the sound are wonderful the puzzles are NOT as easy as some people are saying  the Water Temple is maddening  and the character development and depth of play is unmatched
Majoras Mask is almost as good but what makes Ocarina of Time better in my opinion is the fact that it is sort of the ultimate Zelda game meaning it starts from the beginning and recreates the entire story of Link and Zelda and Ganon and it is a completely standalone and definitive game Majoras Mask on the other hand takes place right after the events of Ocarina of Time and has a very different structure The threeday cycle you must live through makes for an extremely enjoyable game but the only downside is you cant take your time and relish everything like you can in Ocarina of Time
Either way though Ocarina of Time is a beautiful gameThis is the best N RIP game I have ever played Its full of vast D worlds cool characters and has a deep storyline The worlds are huge Take Hyrule Field A place which has absolutely nothing to do with the story but going there to get new places is soooo much fun When you arent doing anything and are just playing around you can have hours of fun running around hunting skullkids and running from those flying spikey flower thingies When youre an adult you can hunt poes ghosts in the field and get rewards and stuff for it Anyway the story is about a boy named Link who is destined to save his home world Hyrule from A powerful wizard The wizard wants to get ahold of the Triforce an ancient artifact which has the power to alter the world He does and changes the world to a hell Link then has to go through many dungeons and meet many people and eventully save his land of Hyrule and return peace Thats about it PeaceThis is the nd best Nintendo  game to date right behind Golden Eye  We all know that Golden Eye  is impossible to top but this comes damn near close
Zelda Ocarina of Time is a classic Five stars plus Matter of fact this is the best Zelda release I have ever played And I have played them all
The graphics really show what the Nintendo  is capable of putting out along with other classics like Mario  and Golden Eye The graphics are amazing and are top notch
The storyline is even better Most good RPGs have more than just one single character This game however only has Link and still manages to become a classic like most of the other Zelda titles No this game is no Final Fantasy IIV but in a way this game is better Maybe not as long but the storyline is a little bit more creative and catchy
Ocarina of Time offers a little bit more extras than the previous Zelda titles have to offer You can collect extra items along the way for personal score to see how good your discovering ability is and not just finding pieces of hearts There are so many secrets with this game
I would suggest you dont use the strategy guide until you have completed the game If you do then you are cheating yourself and making the game not even worth playing Beat the game and then look at the guide to see what you have missed
Overall I spent a lot of time on this game I could have beaten it a lot faster but that wouldnt be any fun because the fun part is discovering the secrets within the game itself
Buy the game and see for yourself This isnt exactly a hard challenge of a game but it isnt exactly that simple either Just right Get it todayZelda Ocarina of Time is a fantastic gamethe different worlds are well madethe day and night thing is very nicethe characters are greatI actually hated the bad guyincluding the horse to move inside the different worlds is a good idea and the music is beautifulmy husband was always with his back at the tvbecause he uses to use the computer when I play games and he just couldnt believe how good the music ishe kept turning and looking to see what was I playing with such musicyou do feel that you are in a fantasy world playing this gamewich I thought it was very cooland arent those little fairies cute
ReallyI recommend this gameno matter what kind of game genre is that you playyoull love this oneQuite possibly if you dont know why then you havent played many videogames simply the best  great story great graphics great control great replay value  it is true n wasnt that great of a system with pretty horrible games  i bought it back in  and up until i got my ps i only bought a few games for it  Zelda ocarina Zelda Majora Goldeneye Perfect Dark and DK  There may be other good games but this game is by far the best not just on n  but possibly out of all video games ever  trust me people if i say it is good it is good  I dont give out good reviews very easilyOcarina of Time is the finest game made for the Nintendo   It is possibly the finest video game made to date  This beautiful D world will challenge even the most jaded gamer  The dungeons and temples are beautifully rendered and each has a remarkably executed theme  The storyline for the game is a typical Zelda story of Link vs Gannon but the execution and the gameplay keep it head and shoulders above the rest  You would be doing yourself a disservice to own a Nintendo  console without this phenomenal gameawesome storyline awesome graphics perfect game great challenge but not too challenging that you cant beat it Thanx nintendo for the greateast game ever made Great game for all ages highly recommendedThis is the nd best game Ive ever played Even if I like Excitebike  more I cant wait until I can get this I dont have it but my brother and I got all the way to Forest Temple from the start in just  days Then we had to return it But Its my favorite Zelda game everThis is one of the best games  You have to play it  It is definitely the best game in the Zelda series so far  It has adventure romance mystery and SO many subquests  Its about a boy named Link who has a destiny  He lives in Kokiri Village a little tiny village in the land of Hyrule  Anyway a little fairy named Navi comes and says that he must meet the Deku Tree  He does and the Deku Tree tells him to go inside the Deku Tree and destroy all of the evil monsters inside him  Link does this and the Deku Tree gives him the Kokiri Emerald or the Spiritual Stone of Forest  The Deku Tree phrophesies that Ganondorf an evil desert Gerudo man is trying to get hold of the Triforce the essence of life in Hyrule  But in order to get hold of the Triforce you have to get three of the spiritual stones  Unfortuantely after the trees prophecy he died because of the curse Ganondorf had cast upon him  But Link and Navi go on their journey and get the Gorons Ruby or Spiritual Stone of Fire and the Zoras Sapphire or Spiritual Stone of Water  Link gets the Ocarina of Time but when he opens the doors Ganondorf gets in before him and he gets the Triforce  Link waits seven years in the Chamber of Time and when he awakes hes all grown up  Rauru the Sage of Light is there and tells him that he must save all the Sages from their temples and receive the medallions  He receives the Medallion of Light Forest Fire Water Shadow and Spirit  But the game  Its definitely one of the best N games aroundTHE BEST N GAME Its easy difficult to totally master and is fun to play again and again The bosses are creative and original and the dungeons are fun and easy Storyline is pretty good better than the save the princess generalization its often given The characters are a quiet hero of time an eternally youthful forest girl a wild rock man from the firey Death Mountain a rebellious fish woman a determined royal guard a sexy thief the princess and of coure Ganon the bad guythis is a game that is perfect it is so fun to play at times when the sun gos down u can do a lot of stuff in this game its very cool its got  hole hours of this game there are good ponits in this game very nice game GREAT MUSIC better then zelda  for the n this game has much more to have even if u think u have gotton all moneys and more u have much more for this game it is a must have n game lovers u will want this MASTER GAME for your systemZelda  is defenetly one of my favorite games for the N  It has a fairly good story its interesting enough to make you want to know what happens next and it has a gameplay thats unbeatable  The combat system is very simple and great  You have your z locking on system which makes killing enemies a piece of cake  There is so much to do in this game that its comaprable to a good RPG something that N hasnt been blessed with yet  The graphics are pretty good especially since they dont use the expanssion pack and the world is just huge  One down side is that some puzzles in the caves can be pretty tough and sometimes you may feel lost and dont know what to do next The bosses look very impressive and get more challenging as you progress through the game  This game will defently take a couple months to beat unless you play   After you master the game then itll just take a couple of days like any other normal or great game  Nintendo has defenetly done a great job with this one  One thing I didnt like about it is that it has gotten eaiser than its predicessors Ive started playing Zelda games since the SNES days  Back then it was Zelda A Link to the Past  The game was tough  Ill admit it it took me a year to beat that That game was also HUGE  But now D has made things eaiser which I like and dont like  But another thing I dont like  They keep on changing the whole story of Zelda Those of you who played the SNES game will know what Im talking about  There Link didnt live in a forest and there wasnt a guardian fairy  And the whole world changed too  Well maybe its for the best but I wouldnt mind if they made a remake of it maybe for the GBAAn excellent game for those like me who like adventure and a new challenge Zelda will leave you amazed In the game you must save your world by fighting evil monsters solving puzzles beating bosses and temples etc and getting the items and weapons etc you need in order to achieve these and other goals
You are the worlds last hope Can you save everyone and defeat the evil Ganondorf in this breathtaking adventure gameThe Legend of Zelda Ocarina of time is the best zelda game there is You go from being a kid to being an adult Link must beat five temples as an adult the forest temple the fire temple the water temple the shadow temple and the spirit temple The bosses are awsome and all the characters are coolThe first Zelda game for the  The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of time won game of the year for   As Link your quest to save the triforce from the evil Ganondorf will take you all over Hyrule not only in the present but also the future with the help of the Ocarina of time  If you like the Zelda series this game is definently for you or even if you just like to save the world in your spare timeThere are no problems with it it works great for Rock Band detects an accurate pitch and everythingIn its tenure the N had its share of bad games With exceptions like Super Mario  the THQ wrestling games and a few others it seemed like the bad outweighed the good But with Ocarina of Time the balance took a drastic shift as n was given its best overall game
Ocarina of TIme has many strong points for itself For one the player is given a very challenging and extremely satisfying quest to undertake The game plays across a vast world with different subsections each with their own particular themes The gameplay is easy to get used to and becomes second nature as you play through the game Graphics and sounds are done extremely well considering the cartridge space allowed
There is not much to complain about as this game really showed players what the N was capable of Its unfortunate that other game publishers didnt work this hard But then again Ocarina is a tough act to followZelda Ocarina of Time is a wellmade game that perfectly blends battle sequences and puzzles  The battles which can only be won using the right method against the right enemy are simplified by ZTargeting which aims all attacks at the enemy  It takes a long time to beat months as any good RPG RolePlaying Game should  Unfortunately it constantly and inevitably reminds you of the controls although theyre pretty easy in messages which you usually must read  I suggest this for all people especially those that enjoy a good challengeThe best game I ever play  In fact I beat this game in a week  Its a good deal and is worth the moneybig timeAlthough the Final Fantasy series was pretty good no other RPG can compare to this
With a very long storyline and if you dont have a strategy guide handy theres a possibility that it might take a while to finish the game completely
The features are just amazing At some points you are required to move into the future  years where Link is a fullgrown adult and sometimes back  years to advance in your journey As an adult some things will have changed And when day turns to night and vice versa some things will change that will be different when compared to the same place only in the daytime
The battles are intense And as for the boss battles the bosses have a variety of options that they can do and to effectively defend you usually have to be prepared for any curves that they throw at you
Legend of Zelda OoT holds a lot of replay value Even after Ive finished the game Im still having a great time
Overall Legend of Zelda OoT is probably one of the best RPGs available Would be definitely worth buying and would also make a wonderful giftI have played all the other Zelda Series Games and this is the best  I first heard of this game when I borrowed it from a friend  I played it nonstop until I beat the game  The only hard part about it is the dreaded Water Temple  It is the only actual hard one but dont get me wrong the rest of the dungeons are equally difficult  Even the first level is as difficult because you have only your sword shield and wits  But as you progress you gain pieces of hearts weapons swords shields and other tools  The graphics are really cool the sound could be just a tad better and the fun is the best  The only bad part is you cant unfreeze Zoras Domain and get the Triforce or Miyamoto says  Well if you liked the other Zelda games this is a must have  If you never have played a Zelda game get a lifeFor all those of you that have followed the lineage of Zelda from its early days on the classic bit system and onward to its SNES days with A Link to the Past great game and loved every second of it then you have to buy this game For those of you that have never played any other Zelda game what are you waiting for Now is a great time to start
Ocarina of Time is amazing All the elements of classic Zelda are there  dozens of powerful items and weapons lots of secrets to find at least  new Drendered challenging dungeons plenty of secrets and sidegames and something that all the other Zeldas never had a truly great story
If you enjoyed A Link to the Past you will most certainly like this game as well The story of Ocarina of Time involves going back and forth in time between a happy peaceful Hyrule and a dark evil one much like ALTTP but dont think this is a ripoff on its predecessor The complex dungeons challenging bosses and deepening story lines will blow you away The D element of the game also adds so much more that was never possible before Even the music is catchy and well orchestrated I actually downloaded the mp soundtrack online
The gameplay is a little tough to get used to  afterall youve never played Zelda in D before  so you actually have to consider things sneaking up behind you and flying overhead But once you get used to the controls and learn to use the ZTargeting feature using the trigger button will solve just about any control problem you may encounter the gameplay gets easier
The only thing that annoyed me was Navi a little fairy that travels with Link throughout the game She is always bugging you to give you painfully obvious information I suppose she is a helpful guide for younger or more inexperienced players but I found her annoying But once you come to realize that Navi is an important aspect of the games control you will let it slide
I would recommend this game to anyone who owns an N console and even more so if you enjoyed SNESs A Link to the Past I cant wait to play the sequel when it comes outI confess ive never played a single Zelda game before this cause i wasnt into RPG games but im so glad i never gave this a miss One day i  just felt like playing this game and i bought it and its terrific no  maybe better than terrific its too good to be true
I spent  good  months playing this game and i finally beat it recently but that hasnt  stopped me from planning round  and buying the brady guidebook to find all  the secrets
This game is also filled with charatcer interaction and  drama I think you can read Amazons review for the storyline and ill just  encourage you to buy this game if you havent
Its a players choice  game and coming from Nintendo i am not surprised its this good Im gonna  get Majoras mask when it comes out this winter and i hope to see this game  on the Dolphin
If you are hooked and want to relive the magic go get an  old NES or SNES from your cousins or someone and buy the previous Zelda  games and youll see why Zeldas a classic
Like Mario Zelda has a huge  following and blah blahi dont need to elaborate on the games success  anymore
As far as fungameplaystorygraphicssoundreplay is concerned  its a safe bet to say that i will give every category at least  out of  
Ill only give it a  when they put in FMV and put to rest once and  for all that Zelda is the definitive standardRPG and actionRPG and not  Final Fantasy Sorry guys i had to say it its true
Now if only  Majoras Mask would arrive sooneroh i cant waitWorks good recognizes my voice well and I have no issues playing Rockband besides just not being good at vocals in general  would buy againMade in  but still better quality play and design than most games on the market in   Good storyline great AI and graphics notoverly aggressive system requirments tons of addons available  Incredible single player mode good weapon selection and arguably one of the best FPS online games of all time  If you like HALO you will like Halflife  Very similar but no limit on how many weapons you can carry and the levels arent as repetative  My biggest complaint about Halo though its obvious why many of the levels and hallways are exact copies of one youve seen dozens of times alreadygives a feeling of being lost and even fed up at times Halo does have the edge as far as cars and what not though I also recommend Halflife  the sequel to what Im talkin about here  INSANE graphics and gameplayHalf Life Revolutionized PC gaming  It is one of the greatest IF not The best pc game ever made  It has bin said that from almost every Pc Mag or Game mag  I was a few to own this masterpiece when it first hit stores and all I can say iswow

This game really changed about the FPS gaming  It just made me think different about FPS  It truly is a masterpiece  I wont spoil this games amazing story of the g mans adventure  I wont even say how good this game is you just have to play it for your self

The graphics for that time was amazing and so will the upcoming HALF LIFE  BABY  nuff said

PS you wont regret thisI usually turned off all lights and played game in deep night after a wholeday work even on bloody Quake I or Doom II it is ok And I was for a long time a Quake II fan esp in single player mode With numerous addon levels distributed on the web I thought the Dshooter game has  reached the limit in Quake II But alas what a game the HalfLife is  I  DARE NOT played it in the deep night alone with all lights off With a very  good storyline and excellent atmosphere the game is horrible  You never  know what the next step will be The monsters are not stupidly standing  there waiting for your bullets instead they are chasing and hunting you  It is simply the best single player d shoot game so farI was never a big fan of the firstperson shooter FPS genre but after giving HalfLife a try thanks to all of the glimmering reviews I am absolutely hooked From the opening tram sequence youre mesmerized by  Gordon Freemans plight and the falling Black Mesa world surrounding him  Its a game that keeps you in a trance from midnight to the first crack of  sunlight apologies to my wife After dishing out punishment to those  Marines be sure to frag some people in the outstanding multiplayer modes  The fun gets even better and the taste of death is even sweeter when you  blow apart that guy with  kills HalfLife is truly a work of art  Opposing Forces here I comeEven though this game is so goodI think you should get Spyro  first Spyro the Dragon gets you to a demo that leads to this I know youll like it If you have Spyro  then try the demo That is what I didCrash is one of the best games ever made This is way over priced though If some one buys this then they are stupid because you can find it for a lot cheaper Luckily I still have all the crash games since I played them when I was a kidI love this game I played it and beat it in  hour  I did not get any of the relics though I love playing as coco on a jet ski and running across the great wall of China I did each level and boss and I loved it I played it all the way through with no gems and relics I give this a strong  stars out of The last mainline Crash game in the PS Similar in style to Crash  but with added vehicle segmentsWell lets end the Crash Bandicoot trilogy on PlayStation with Crash Bandicoot  Warped This game was released in  and was once again developed by Naughty Dog published by Sony Computer Entertainment and distributed by Universal Interactive Studios It was originally a PlayStation exclusive but was later rereleased as a PS One Classic on the PlayStation Store
 The games story takes place immediately after the events of the second game in which the ruins of the Cortex Vortex come crashing down to Earth and lands on a temple unleashing an evil entity known as Uka Uka who is Aku Akus evil twin brother Aku Aku is the mask that helped Crash out in the first two games Uka Uka joins with Doctor Neo Cortex and Doctor Nefarious Tropy as they plan to gather Crystals in their original places in time and use their energy to enslave the Earth
 The game is once again a platformer with pretty much the same kind of controls as the second game You can not only play as Crash but also as his sister Coco who was a supporting character in the second game You travel back and forward in time to gather the  Crystals from the previous game in their original places in time before the enemy does but dont worry the levels are completely different from each the second game The game takes place in the TimeTwisting Machine which acts as the hub area of the game The machine is split into five chambers with only the first chamber being available at the start Each chamber has five buttons that open portals to different levels The goal is the same as the second game obtain the crystal hidden in the area Some crystals can be obtained in the middle of the level or by completing a certain task such as winning a race The gems are also back and can only be obtained by destroying all the boxes or completing a hidden level or task Once you obtain the five crystals in a chamber a sixth button will appear that warps you to a boss who will fight you in order to get the crystals back By defeating the boss the next chamber will become available to play By defeating a boss you unlock a new power theres the Super Slam which makes your body slam more powerful the double jump a tornado twister which lets you glide for a short period a bazooka launcher which can be used to destroy crates or enemies or collect fruit and one ups and the running shoes which allow you to sprint
 The newest main feature in the game is the Relics which can only be retrieved in a time trail mode for every level in the game After you obtain a levels crystal you can go back to the level and collect the yellow clock at the beginning to start a time trail The goal is to reach the end as fast as you can but there are some differences There are yellow time boxes that when destroyed will stop the clock for a short period of time there are no checkpoint boxes so if you die you have to start the level from the beginning but there are plenty of Aku Aku masks to help you and thats pretty much it It proves to be very challenging and getting the Platinum relics is insanely difficult and even I never managed to get all of them
 This game proves to be the best one in the entire series and one of my favorite games overall period I would highly recommend getting this game off the PlayStation Store for  this is a MUST PLAY It really is one of the best
FINAL RATING   out of Im so glad I was able to buy this game at a great price I really enjoyed reliving my childhoodthree years after I bought this game the children still play it every weekend clearly a winner in their booksCRASH is my favorite videogame character i remember playing it when it first came out with my sister on the PS waaaaay back This is SO fun I love this game JUST BUY ITTTTThis is a great game I played this all the time when I was younger and had to have it now as an adult Play it all the timeThis microphone hooked right into the Xbox and worked on par with all expectationsFirst off Ive only owned two Crash Games The first Crash Bandicoot and Wrath of Cortex for the PS I played a demo for Warped on my Spyro the dragon game and wanted it ever since I bought it on Amazon and its safe for me to say thatTHIS IS THE CRASH I KNOW AND LOVE

 For those who dont know Crash Bandicoot first came out in the s as a standard straightforward platformer Youre a mutated Bandicoot named Crash who escapes from the evil mad scientist Dr Neo Cortex and must go back to save your girlfriend In Warped Dr Cortex now works for Uka Uka The brother of Aku Aku an evil mask that wants to destroy crash and take over the world He instructs Cortex to go through time and collect Crystals and Gems that hold extreme power Crash has to literally race through time and jump spin and dance his way through time to retrieve them before Cortex gets ahold of them

 This game is just as fun as the first one It brought me back to a time where video games concentrated more on gameplay and content rather than graphics which games today seem to concentrate almost too much on The controls are spot on You can build momentum for jumps move in any direction and really I never had problems with the controls even in the first Crash One thing I REALLY love about this one is that I dont feel bad when I die This game has some really interesting death scenes rather youre forcibly kissed by a frog that changes into a prince eaten by lions thrown into the screen by a twoheaded fat person or so on When I finish the game I plan on seeing how many ways I can die Some worlds replicate each other but are harder and take more and more skill to get through The boss battles are really diverse and take strategy timing and skill to get rid of I must confess I found the first boss and  worlds extremely easy Its not until the  that the game just goes F this Im gonna make your time a living hell Its still way easy so far compared to the first game though which really did what I said above I also noticed something that first caught my attention in Wrath of Cortex The game seems extremely open when it comes to lives Seriously Im not even half way through the game and all ready up to  almost I guess Im that good at playing Im definately buying the second one

 I admit Im disappointed at the way the turn the series have made I wish they kept it as a patformer and just added maybe some adventure elelments to it like they did Twinsanity even though its glitchy as hell Naughty Dog where did you go Crash Bandicoot Warped is just what I expected it to be Its funny addicting challenging and overall just shows graphics dont make the game but its content and gameplayCant review this title now cuz I still havent officially finished CRASHs  I bought it TO HAVE Im a classic game collector at heart dont know when Ill start playing but i will eventually Now that its in my libraryI would say this is one of the the best ps games ever I play it on my ps
It is fun from riding a tiger to running around spinning bad guys This is child friendly but also adults love it
It has good graphics good gameplay good ideas and lots of levels and replay value Get this you wont miss outThis game is just as much fun as the first one with whole new levels based on the now classic Crash Bandicoot gameplay I would recommend this to anyone Crash fan or notAll right for the guys that hate to read a lot about real quick if you like d platform action adventure titles and maybe you like CB just one thing GET IT

OK now to business I have been in the world of video games since Atari  and colecovision so after more than  years of gaming I KNOW of what I am talking about if I say its worth is worth it but the final word is always yours

Gameplay
This game has everything you need for hours of high quality of gaming experience the art concept of the game goes over expectations of the hardware limitation of the PSO The design of every single element in the game is very creative and unique the developers invested time on the comedy of the game which is a tradition on the original trilogy as usual the controller its a wonder no need to struggle controlling the character and it vibrates as well the powers the moves and the style of the main character CB its superb every part of the game becomes fun not repeatable pattern of enemies or levels the game itself has a lot of extras for a replay definitely an outstanding game

Difficulty Platinum RELICS
Curse frustration but with practice you might become a CBW master

Plot
Well do not expect a twisted chrono trigger plot as always in crash games the lack of plot its compensated with a beautiful work in the software itself basically crash goes trough a set of portals using N Cortex once again his back with an ally Own technology through time and space the main thing is of course stop them

Graphics
This is the strongest part of the game no doubt the game is programmed to utilize MOST of the potential of the PSO GPU they managed to create excellent crystal effects water light sources and shiny surfaces like chrome and ice one of the few games that deserve to be owned forever unopened one the few great looking games for PSO

Overall
Perfect over all score once again if you thing you can beat the game with one hand attached at your back and with folded eyes try getting beyond  and all the platinum relics the real gamer and fans of the series did it look for it on you tube so the difficulty is very acceptable this is by far the best Crash Bandicoot game by far since I personally thing that going trough naughty dog to travelers tales lost a bit of formula of this great franchise but oh well see yasThis game takes months to get  completion The new feature in this is getting time rellicksby doing level fastand swimming In Crash  you get Balders after you sometimes in Crash  you get a dinosaur I prefered being chased by a balder and when it squashed Crash it went into the screen but you dont get it in this
BUY this if you want a platformerafter Crash  and The Crash games for playstion are very fun gameseven better than the mario games Out of the Crash seires I think this one is the best There are alot of thing you can do and the bosses rock The story line is the best in this game It takes plase after Crash were Dr Cortex ship falles down on a temple wich releses a demon mask The mask that pertected crash in the first two games stats talking and tells crash that the evil mask is his Brother and his plan to build a time machine to get crystles to
destroy earth The replay vaule is high and the gamplay is fun you wont be able to put this game down for awilethis is one old school fun game to fight against your friends  you can not create any thing  hours of fun from royal rumble to regular matches and there is quite a bit of people to play asLove this game Takes me back to when games like this were made Shipped fast As always though the game was dirty A little water and a paper towel fixed it right upThis is my all time favorite wrestling game ever made I really enjoy this game alot the modes you have are exhibition tag team special matches like  on  you have also a  player battle royal which to me is my all time favorite feature in this game what so ever winning the titles in this game is alot of fun and to me this game is alot better than the overrated smackdown here comes the pain and it is alot easier than that game as well I dont get why people say smackdown here comes the pain is so great when in reality it sucks because the ai in season mode is very cheap and I hate ai like that but in this game on easy mode the ai is way to easy but to me this game is just awesome and I still play this game alot to this day I never get tired of itGreatest wrestling game ever to this day Not only does it feature the best wrestlers from the greatest time period in all of wrestlings history but that greatness translates into the game Fun and very real controll like features Cant say enough how great the game isI remember when this game first came out It was mind blowing as to just how awesome it was It had basically anyone  everyone youd ever want in a wrestling game minus some legends And if you had  controllers   friendsIt was going down for hours Well this game is still pretty cool despite its age The Graphics obviously dont look as awesome as they used to But still they could look worseAnd the gameplay is still easy to pick up  enjoy Infact I wish the wrestling games of today could get the controls simple  fluid as on this N game If they could remake this game w an expansive create a playerwrestler and simple controls Id easily buy that too I highly recommend this to anyone that is a game collector Or anyone who hasnt played games of this era but are getting older games There is a crap load of characters cool match modes And as I stated earlier get controllers  some buddysGreat Game One Of The Best Of N Next To Paper Mario And Zelda OoT Ofcourse Anyway Buy It If You Have A N And Also Get wCw Nitro For PS Anyway BUY THIS AND NITRO AND THUNDER ALL FOR PSNote This review has been edited since it was first posted
I loved this game when it first came out and to this day its one of my favorites The wrestlers most of them anyway have a whole lot of moves and they are not all the same for every wrestler The inclusion of the real wrestlers signature moves is very cool One of the things I especially like about the game is the number of wrestlers on it There are  of them  thats a lot more than a lot of later wrestling games have A few of them are locked at the start but theyre not really that hard to unlock  at least not with the difficulty level on easy Several wrestlers who were later on the Legends games Hogan Macho Man Sting Bret Hart Steiners and others are here Some of the wrestlers are madeup or at least I assume they are The graphics are good The wrestlers are blocky but the real wrestlers faces are very realistic The play control is very good  a lot better than the play control on World Tour Some people may think the gameplay isnt deep enough but it suits me just fine The man Battle Royal is really cool There are several different arenas which is kinda neat but in my opinion doesnt really do that much for the game The sound effects and music are in my opinion not great but good enough The wrestlers dont have individual entrance music but oh well  no biggie again my opinion There is no commentary but thats fine with me because I always turn off the commentary on games anyway One of my fave game features is the Costume Change mode This mode lets you take wrestlers and put other wrestlers outfits on them and lets you edit the colors of the outfits Thats fun I think so anyway You can even change the wrestlers names but why would you ever really want to do that unless maybe somebody like Giant has changed their name in real life There isnt much if anything about this game that I have any major complaints about Sure its dated now but I still find it as fun as I did back in  I think thats when it first came out Just because something is old now that doesnt mean it isnt still goodmy grandkids and their parents love playing with the microphone along with the guitar we got
this really is a lot of fun for everyone  would totally recommend getting this if someone has an interest in music singingThis is and was the best wrestling game ever and the big bonus is its WCWNWO not WWE so all the wrestlers are awesomeThis is one of my favorite games of all time  In this game there are  different levels that are mostly composed of the same D Crash levels that were used to Some levels however you get to use a biplane motorcycle or Jet Ski Like the previous versions of Crash you have to collect crystals and gems  Now you can also collect a relic for having the best time  The music is fun the controls are easy and its just an overall great game for any agenow this time you will see a floting pieces of space station that cortex have bulided now this time one evil has returned her name is uka uka in heart of aku aku he knows that if uka uka will get crystals then ever thing is doomed by this time crash will do anything to stop cortex from collecting  crystals by killing bosses you will get powers such as super charge body salmdouble high jumptondoro double spinfruit bazoka and faster bootsLet me tell you all about this great game I wouldnt want to give the story away but let me tell you The original two are no match for this great game This game has  new colorful and nice levels and  hidden ones Almost all of them have nice and pretty graphics There are more features too For one thing there is the Time Trial mode in which you go through the levels in a certain amount of time and you will get relics You can play as Coco riding her adorable tiger Pura a jetski a blimp and a couple more Crash himself can do some more things like a Super Belly Flop a Double Jump a Triple Spin use Speed Shoes and use a Fruit Bazooka for long range attacks Also he can ride an airplane a motorcycle a baby TRex and more Also even dying is humorous Now for the games one flaw It is hard to be challenged However there are  types of relics If you get all of the Sapphire Relics you can get a really good ending If you get all the Gold Relics you get  But the Platinum Relics require a master to collect So if you like all thats said and even if you didnt you will definitely love itTHQs second American release is a huge leap in graphics from the original World Tour Dozens of wrestlers from the NW WCW Ravens Flock cruiserweights heavyweights and some of which are made up for the game The great thing about this game is it was back in WCWs hayday when it had talented wrestlers like Jericho Benoit Malenko and Raven more talent means more moves more moves means more fun The only real modes other than battle royals and handicapped matches are a series of championship tournaments to go through in a specific weight  talent class There are incredible looking arenas even with an isle to brawl in and weapons that you can pull from the crowd and bring into the ring The unfortunate part about this game is that it is dated and it moves very slowly compared to Wrestlemania and No MercyI cant even begin to explain how much I love this game as well as the second Crash Bandicoot gameI havent played the first game yet because they are so much fun with lots and lots of humorous levels and disasters
Bandicoot is a marsupial on a muey dangerouso quest to collect  crystals and  relics in a quest to stop Dr Neo Cortex and Aku Akus evil twin Uka Ukas quest to take over the world
There are so many things that make this game so addictive
 The music Its so hilarious
 The complex levels
 The graphics are so awesome
 The way Crash dies IE falling off screen and his shoes fly up and fall back down being sucked into a giant spinning vase and the lid closes on top of it
By God to really even explain how great this game really is is difficult for me
Like Sonic the Hedgehog was for Sega and Mario was for Nintendo Crash is for the Playstation
In this day and age of excessively bloody and violent video games the Crash Bandicoot series is a great sigh of relief I tend to enjoy sillier cartoonish games like this I will never tire of this gameI got this game when I was like years old and I still play itIm  now
I think all the Crash Bandicoots were a new cahnge for psx and I hope that they continue to stick with psxI love it Use it all the time Really works perfectly with all games that you need a mic forThe original Crash game was very hard to beat  It was still classic  Then Crash  came out with several hard levels and tough bosses  Then out came this one Crash Warped  This is the cult classic of the series  I have beaten the entire game and never once been disappointed because of too much or too little challenge I even managed to get a  file with the help of my brother and a twerp i know  There are two secret levels  They are Eggipus Rex and Hot Coco  To get to Eggipus Rex  you go into time trails in the Dino Might level  Then board the yellow gem platform  Keep running until you find the second pterydactyl the triceratops will be already chasing you and let it take you away  To get into the Hot Coco level simply crash into the road sign with an alien on it in the Road Crash level  This game is a classic and every PS One or PS owner needs to have it  Was this review helpful OF COURSE IT WASthis is a very good gameit is very challenging it has lots of levels and i managed to get  but the ps crash is more challenging but the bad thing of the ps crash is that the loading takes more than  minutesIm a big Crash fan and got this game the Christmas it came out This game is incredible Its easy enough for young kids about  or  or even really experienced gamers age depending It has very good graphics for a PS game and you can use the dual shock or regular controls in this Unlike former Crash games you use more devices than before and in some levels are actually Coco Crashs intelligent little sister For example
Baby Tiger Ridden by Coco
Baby TRex Ridden by Crash
Jet Ski Mobile Ridden by Coco
Motorcycle Ridden by Crash
Fastmoving spaceship Ridden by Coco
BiPlane with guns Ridden by Crash and Coco level depending
Underwater Jet Ski Mobile Ridden by Crash
Additionaly you get to fight other bosses and defeating each boss earns you a special item There are  in all
 Super Body Slam lets you break through protected crates
 Double Jump allows you to jump over higher obstacles
 Tornado Spin spins around wildly helps you glide over big
pits
 Fruit Bazooka a giant gun that can blast away your enemies
 Speed Shoes gives you power to run used to get certain relics
The final thing Crystals Gems Colored Gems and Relics
Crystals Right on the path for normal levels Theyre thin and pink Touch them and youve obtained them Just beat the level to earn one after you pick them up One per normal level
Gems To get these break all the boxes in the level Sometimes youll have to have earned a color gem to get a gem  to  per normal level
Colored Gems  in all one every  levels  normal levels  secret levels They serve as platforms to new areas in some levels To get them ride on a platform in some levels for the platform to appear you have to not have died up to that platform One in a level every  levels
Relics A new addition After you get the relic in the level go back and get the relic by going as fast as you can through the level and getting a certain time There are three types
SapphireThe basic You can get this with no speed shoes
GoldMore advanced Most level you need speed shoes
PlatinumExpert level EXTREMELY hard to aquire Lots of practice needed
Thats pretty much all that you need to know All I can say is besides the tips have funThis is the best action game for the Playstation that I have ever played  During the game you play and Crash and his sister Coco  Their goal is to compete  levels to get all of the crystals needed to defeat Neo Cortex  For every five levels there is also a boss that must be defeated  Defeating each boss gives Crash a new power move that will be needed in upcoming levels  There are also five bonus levels in the game  The levels have Crash and Coco running swimming flying planes and spaceships and riding tigers jetskis dinosaurs and harleys  For an additional challenge you can try to get the one or two gems that are found on each level  This usually requires smashing all of the boxes found on the level  For an even greater challenge you can try to get the relic found on each level by racing thru the level under a specified amount of time
Warning  This game is very addictive  I cant stop playing until I get all of the crystals gems and relics  Even though my goal is to complete the game its entertaining to watch all of the different ways Crash can die see what happens when a frog catches you or when you get stuck by the porcupine fish  The game offers much variety which keeps it very interesting but is still easy to learn because of the limited number of controls  If you ever get stuck and cant figure out how to get a crystal gem or relic there are several walkthrus that can be found on the web  I highly recommend buying this game  I cant imagine anybody not liking it unless they just like the hardcore shooting games like Quake heyin this game Crash has a bazooka  If you like this game and racing games I also highly recommend Crash Team Racing CTR  I cant wait until the new Crash Bandicoot game comes out for the PSGraphics   The best visuals of the series The colours shine fantastically and it all looks stunningly beautiful The characters are clear and the game has backgrounds I could feast on
Sound   Great uses of evil voicing and fantastic sound editing detail makes Crash s sound get a notch up
Value   Youll be begging for more
Overall   Fantastically detailed game that mixes genres and characters into a big story that erupts with fabulous enjoyment In short buy itThis is the best platform game Ive played and eliminates all down sides of its two prequels  Youre a bandicoot and jump on  spin baddies you encounter  This game is kind of like old Mario games but has awesome graphics  Theyve added a type of box to the prequel and give one move such as bazooka or tornado death spin for each boss  The game is easy to beat but offers extras for breaking all the boxes or beating a level quickly  Its extremely difficult to collect all of them  I recommend this game for everyone especially people with a lot of free time on their handsbeen wanting to get this my sons love all the grand theft games thanks for having itTHANK YOU FOR A WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE THANK YOU AND SEE YA AGAIN YOU ROCK A ALL THE WAY A AThis game has all the violence and language of the current popular Grand Theft Auto games packing into a convenient D package This is where it all started If your and old school gamer youve probably already played this And if not it is a great game If your a GTA fan but havent played this it is a must to truly understand how great and innovated this series is and has become If your not a fan of old school gaming though you may not like itThe first installment in the GTA franchise this game is awsome the story is simple and the gameplay is funI remember when my parents got me this game for Christmas  years ago That was good times Liberty Citys based on New York City featuring Brocklyn based on Brooklyn Kings based on Queens Brix based on Bronx Manhaddan based on Manhattan but no island based on Staten Island  Liberty Citys bordered by the Garden State of New Guernsey based on the Garden State of New Jersey  Very decent graphics by  standards  Realistic car controls  Realistic gun fights  No so realistic fist fights  Good music  There are  more cities to unlock such as the unidentified city in the Golden State of San Andreas based on San Francisco California and Vice City in the Sunshine State of Florida based on Miami Florda  So get out there grab a car and have some funThis is the original that started it all If you can you past the fact that it is quite dated you will absolutely love everything about this title The gameplay is rocksolid and the game moves really fast Camera is great as the whole game is viewed from a birds eye perspective The game is very open ended and you will never get bored while playing thisIve never sat down to actually play Super Mario  I started to play itand its different than other Mario gamesand its funI purchased this game from Gamer Girls and it arrived on time and in the condition described The game worked well on the first try and was clean This is one of my favorite games of the Mario series so I was ecstatic to be able to play this again Thank you so muchthis is my childhood mario game

i get lots of laughs when watching someone plays the haunted house

what i dont like in the game is the rabbit they should give me a rifle or a shotgunArrived according to the time that was given was packaged expertly For an older game it played without flaws there was no visible wear inside or out on the gameWe plugged this microphone into the Wii and it just worked We find USB easier to deal with on the Wii than using the microphone jack

With all the noise of the games such as Rock Star I cant really tell how good the audio quality is but that also means that it is good enough for Wii

It seems like it is well made but we have only used it    times so I dont know how it will hold up over time The previous two microphones different manufacturer didnt last long before we had to start holding the cable in certain positions to make them work

This microphone does what it is supposed to Nothing lackingGreat game from my childhood now my son gets to play it Works well Im not adding more words okGames sticker was very faded not like shown online But the game works great and arrived fastWorks great

Another cool thing even if a song doesnt have harmony parts for more than one singer you can still do fakeharmony as all mics plugged in remain active  However the backup singers will not be rated and will actually mess with the lead as the game doesnt differentiate what mic is being used for lead UNLESS there actually is a harmony part  Meaning  if youre just singing to party you can use all three mics on any song and theyll all just be treated as lead  Pretty cool when you have a room full of mic hogs around the house like we do  lol  Its just like when people would gang up all on one mic during a song but now they actually feel like rock stars having their own mics  For this reason we just always keep all three mics plugged in and anyone can just pick one up and join in  Just dont expect a good score Classic game  Not only did I beat the game but I gathered all  stars  I still have my old Nintendo  and I occasionally like to play on it and reminisceI had this when it st came out in  THIS GAME SO FREAKING AWESOME N Till this day Im playing this awesome game on my gaming laptop with my XBOX ONE CONTROLLER Oh by the way I got this GAME FOR FREE ON MY LAPTOPCame in really good condition played perfectly fine I had tons of fun with this game and Id definitely recommend this if yore looking to have funWe bought this item for our Wii It does not work at all for it  So that was a disapointment We did decide to keep it though because it works wonderfully on our xbox This game arrived quickly and as described I am happy with this purchase Thank youIts not just nostalgic that makes this game good  It still holds up with stars to find and defeat the evil bowser it is one heck of a journey  One of the best platforms still to this dayOne of my favorite N games It was in great condition and worked perfectly A must play for Mario fans new and oldA truly revolutionary and classic game Theres are many reasons people still play this title If you have an N this

graphics are absolutely Gorgeous  If you liked Dirt or Dirt you are going to love Dirt   The game was easier to configure with my Logitech wireless rumblepadand with my EVGA GTX  and all detail set to full on graphics at  x  I get over  fps  The game looks good plays well and is a blastI played this game originally on a friends PC and it was okay played this version on my N and had to have it Its much better graphics wise and blood and guts wise than the original Quake  Also beats the crap out of DOOM by a long margin  You have to have it to believe it  I am hooked now Im getting off my computer and playing some quake with my buds  Did I mention you can play more than one player  and you can play against each other too  YOU CANThis was exactly what was needed and has worked flawlessly since being received I recommend it if you need oneThis is the game that made D Before the goal was moving to the right in platformers Super Mario  is the first D platformer and after  years still plays fantastically Anyone with an N needs to own this game Its the best selling N game for a reasonSuper Mario  is all in all a brilliant game Hands down best one for N and in all honesty the LAST GREAT MARIO game bringing Mario into the D worldOh the good old days playing Mario still play it from time to time Game arrived in great conditionI own this game as a teenager believe me if you havent play this game you missing a lot Totally worth playing it even as adult actually to complete it even a couple of times  If i could give  star i would miss old games maybe now with new games we get better graphics but everything else is actually worseI had this game long ago and then was forced to pawn it  Now I have it again and I love it  I recommend it for anyone interested in the old Doom style first person shooters  Awesome gameVery fun long game Simple controls that must be finely articulated to master this game Some simple levels for kids some difficult levels for those better at gamesI rated this product as I have because it exceeded my expectations Also I would recommend this product to othersThis is easily the best game Ive ever played  I played it back when it was first released for the N and at the time there was nothing else like it on any of the other consoles It led the way for d gaming which is of course the norm now  To this day I still get nostalgic and pop the cartridge in on occasion just to run around in the various worlds The graphics still look pretty good and the game play is still fun  A simply incredible gameWhere are all the green pipes

Why is there no coin counter for running around the Castle There are coins all over the place I want to collect a  coin castle star Did you even think before you sent this to production BRO Is this even this games final form

I would definitely recomend itFor those of you who havent played Super Mario  I would like to say on behave of all of us that have your truly missing out Super Mario  was the very first video game I ever played on my Nintendo  so my review could be a little biased but I just recently replayed the game from start to finish and it still has not lost its touch Its a game for people that love adventures puzzles shooting and the occasional flying It never seizes to get old and the graphics are as good as they can get for the Nintendo 

The object of the game is simple Bowser has kidnapped Princess Peach and you Mario the greatest Plummer in the world must save her Bowser is hiding somewhere in the castle and you must find him by collecting all of the hidden stars scattered throughout various paintings that give Mario his power To find Bowser you must climb to the top of the tower Each floor requires a certain number of stars that have to be collected before you can move on Every painting that has stars in them are magical paintings that Mario can jump through to transport himself to a different world were he can explore for stars

Overall I rank the game a  for its creativity and several different ways it keeps players focused and entertained The makers of Mario did a fantastic job integrating so many different aspects of gaming which in turn made it so great I hope that whoever is reading this can come to their senses and BUY THIS GAMEThe kids play this game at least once a week since theyve had it so yes its worth the moneyThis work no problem at all and appreciated it Lots of fun peoples love playing the game all together WoohooJust as described my son was very happy with this product when he opened the package  Well worth the moneyEnjoying playing this game with no complaints Met my expectations and would do business again with this seller again years later still a great game
This is a classic in every sense of the word
It not only redefined the Mario Franchise it redefined D gaming

It is a must have it you still own a Nlove it the kids love it and its not xbox  lol moms and dads and some grand parents would love it tooIts strange to me that in all the years since Super Mario  was released in  I never wrote  a review for this groundbreaking utterly fantastic game that has meant so much to me over the years

To give just a little history when the N came out I had some family who were in the middle of a divorce after an ugly affair in  with a pastor of a church we all went too  My friend who we will call Courty who was born in  and who I consider as close as a brother was just a young kid and going through the hell of his family disintegrating  His father was dysfunctional and drank a lot and his mother was an adulterer  His mother and my mother grew up together and known each other since grade school  His brother and my brother were best friends being the same age  And although there was a seven year difference between himself and I we were super close and still are because of how close our families were and still are  I remember turning  in January of  and my family had a big birthday party and I got my very own N and a copy of this game

Those were brutally hard times for all involved with so much pain  The parents divorced and the dad got his own house  In the midst of that the boys dad bought him an N along with Super Mario  and Star Wars Shadows of the Empire  For me this game is forever tied up into that emotionally turbelent period in our lives because both my friend and myself would play this for hours and hours just to escape the hollowness and the pain we both felt at what was going on around us  That my friends is the power of Super Mario

Anyway I grew up in the NES and SNES era  Context is so important because without the context of growing up in those years the impact of Super Mario  is completely lost to younger people  To the generation that has The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim Gears of War the Grand Theft Auto series the Mass Effect trilogy Assasins Creed Metroid Prime trilogy  and the Call of Duty series playing through Super Mario  now may feel like youre going backwards and youd be right

The best analogy for those who didnt grow up during that time would be like watching a black and white television from the s or s and then within a mere ten years you are now watching a Plasma TV capable of D technology  Or the  movie The Wizard of Oz when Dorothy opens the door and everything goes from black and white to glorious colour  Super Mario  was THAT much of a gamechanger

Ive been with Super Mario since day one all the way back in   There is not a single Super Mario game that I have missed out playing at launch with only two exceptions Super Mario Land for the Gameboy and Super Mario Sunshine for the Gamecube  Each Mario game was a revelation and just utterly fun back in that era even though they were short  My first exposure to Super Mario  was sometime in the fall of   I just remember being in utter amazement  remember though there may have been some D forays before Super Mario  nothing and I mean NOTHING looked this amazing or played this awesome  I would play the game for hours and hours and felt like I was in a fully interactive novel or world  I can remember thinking Where do game makers go from here  This is utter perfection  I niavely thought the graphics would never be equaled they were that good  I remember telling Courtys brother my own brothers best friend back in the late s Wow just imagine if they go past  bit and go to like  bit or  bit  Just think how amazing that would be  And with the  Bit I felt that what I had been talking about had come to past

For those who didnt grow up back then it can be easily to forget just revolutionary Super Mario  truly was  Just eleven years prior to the  induction of Super Mario  to popular consciousness we were playing such early titles as the original Super Mario Bros the best launch game for the NES hands down Excitebike the absolutely dreadful Ten  Yard Fight etc  From  to  we saw some of the greatest games ever made in glorius Bit but especially the early NES titles are so far removed from current gaming that there will be those out there who find them hard to play  Look at some of the old NES ads on Youtube or game magazines from the s and s

But technology moves on and the SNES and Sega Genesis were fighting for dominance in the early s  Once we graduated to the SNES and the Genesis gamers moved beyond mere platforming to more expansive types of games such as the Final Fantasy titles Act Raiser Sim City Super Metroid Chrono Trigger and The Legend of Zelda A Link tot he Past  Either that or we were all playing Mortal Kombat and Street Fighter II clones  By  we saw Nintendo push the SNES to its limits technologically with such titles as Star Fox and the Donkey Kong Country trilogy as well as Super Mario World  Yoshis Island

The plot is simple  Bowser kidnapped Princess PEACH Toadstool the first time she was ever referred to as Peach in North America after the Princess invited you over for some cake  It is up to you as Mario to go forth and rescue Power Stars that are hidden throughout the castle  Enough about the plot  Lets get to the gameplay

And the gameplay oh the gameplay  You are in a fully interactive D environment  After turning the N on and getting a file set up after spending entirely too much time messing with Marios face at the starting screen  dont worry we all did that Mario jumps out of a pipe and you are in a field with a castle ahead of you  You can jump swim scoot crawl kick punch walljump  Yo  can do a backflip even and a triple jump and a long jump  The game is so vibrant colorful and at least back in the late s simply a beauty to behold

You go to the castle and after you are introduced to your friendly camera man who everyone now very fashionably hates on the Lakitu in a rare state of not throwing Spinies at you you are free to go where ever you wish provided you have enough stars  The castle is the overall hub and by jumping into different portraits on walls pools down tunnels and even looking into the sunlight in the castle will open you to one of the games fifteen overall levels or a secret level  Nintendo wisely made certain parts of the castle inaccessible until you have gained enough power stars but these goals are quite easy to meet

There is simply so much to do and so much to see whether you are fighting King BobOmb and the BobOmb Battle Field raising with Koopa the Quick and navigating the snowy terrains of Cool Cool Mountain and Snow Mans Land

The levels are just so memorable  Mario controls the water levels present in Wet Dry World  Dire Dire Docks has an enormous sub and a cool stingray  Tall Tall Mountain pits you against a theiving monkey  Shifting Sand Land features a great battle against a pair of hands called Eye Rok a cranky vulture who will steal your cap and a great pyramid  Letha Lava Land a level literally likened to hell has a volcano and a sea of lava that Mario must contend with  The last two levels are particularly fiendish Tick Tock Clock is an enormous clock level that speeds up or slows down depending on what time the clock reads when you enter the level and Rainbow Ride always my personal favorite is probably the most difficult with an expansive sky level where Mario gets to ride magic carps riding on enormous rainbows

Then theres Whomps Fortress which was remade into a retro stage for Super Mario Galaxy  always fun Jolly Roger Bay a nautically themed very creepy level with a scary eel and an enormous pirate ship it was always my least favorite a haunted mansion Big Boos Haunt and a level of either epic or bite size preportions TinyHuge Isaldn  Each level brings new and fun ways to interact with the environment hithertoo unseen previously in other levels

There are all three secret cap levels that are a lot of sun as well including flying  Super Mario Bros  may be the first time Mario flew but it was Super Mario  that Mario really took to flight like never before  Also the Princesss Secret Slide is a lot of sun fun and houses the most obscure star of them all you must beat the slide under  seconds and the most surefire way to do that is actually jump off the slide and land down much farhter

One thing that I really love about Super Mario  and which the other D Marios have not included is how open ended the title is  You can really go anywhere and are not limited to individual stars  As great as the Galaxy games are and believe me theyre fantastic especially the second they dont have the open ended exploration of SM and are more linear and streamlined

The closest akin to the exploration factor is Super Mario Sunshine a game I have tried and simply cannot get into  However whereas you are limited to whatever star you choose in Super Mario Sunshine and this fact alone makes for some tedious gameplay in that title in Super Mario  has all six stars available with only one or two exceptions from the get go giving you much more freedom to do whatever you want  Streamlining is important and when Nintendo removed the abilitiy to get any star you want at the onset of the level they ended up with the somewhat confusing and tedious levels of SMS  Its a very fine line between streamlined and open ended but SM has that balance spot on

Going back now yes even though back then I didnt think it was possible back in  when I first played this we moved far beyond this game graphically  The polygons look dated and the camera has gotten a notorious repution with IGN even calling the camera system broken by todays standards  And yes subsequent titles may have perfected the D gameplay but really it was Mario that led the charge and even today the game holds up well  Now I play Super Mario  with my own kids who love it too

This game has meant so much to me and got me and my brother he may as well be through some very rough times  Add And for that I will always be thankful  One of the best games out there without a doubtStupid Sony they forced D games out before anybody was ready Nintendo was forced to cancel many Super Nintendo games Doom FX Star Fox  Mario FX and release the Nintendo  Many popular D games failed in full D Castlevania Mega Man they failed and have not been revived Did Mario succeed YES This game is a legend I heard about it in  not  in a Nintendo Power magazine simply titled Mario I did not own a Nintendo  this was  The only system I had was an original Wii that we used for Mario Kart I was somehow able to persaude my parents to buy me a Wii Point Card with  points on it enough for Mario  and Super Mario Bros  I downloaded it and was greeted with a happy Mario face that said HELLO Soon I was distorting him to where he had no moustache and had big ears Then I started the game and got a message from Peach In her girly princess voice she read the letter which told Mario she had baked a cake for him The plumber could not resist and jumped out of a warp pipe onto the castle grounds I had never played a D Mario Game I stuck to Animal Crossing Mario Kart My Sims and Wii Sports I was  years old After a little bit of exploring I entered the castle Instead of a cake Mario got a scary message from Bowser Who ate cake I guess Soon I was hiking up a hill to meet a giant king bomb complete with a moustache and crown He told me using fancy king words that in order to get the bomb I had to defeat him I defeated him and moved on to the next level a giant fortress ran by slabs of concrete with faces Then I started level  a snow level What a level that was Finding baby penguins building snowmen sliding down a slide Then my parents walked in My mom said YUCK What are those dots supposed to be Those dots were snow flakes My dad said Are those graphics  bit I had not even realized the graphics were bad because I was lost in the creative levels Each level had an original design with interesting puzzles and obstacles put in the way of the star Each boss was different and interesting The graphics are outdate so what This along with Mario  really changed my view of video games Now in  I have almost no respect for highpowered consoles like the Xbox  Kids should play these old games How hard is it to get kids a  card so that they can enjoy a unique classic like this The challenge is not too much If you get stuck on one level you can try another This is a beautiful game that put the Nintendo  to its limitsI have been playing video games for years My first console was the original Nintendo and then the Super Nintendo followed by the Nintendo  Super Mario  came out when I was about  years old and it was an instant hit Super Mario  was the greatest Super Mario game of them all My nephew has a Nintendo  and he wants some new games for his birthday I thought whats better than Super Mario  I bought this for his birthday and he will love it I would recommend Super Mario  to anyone who wants to play a fun and family oriented Mario gameWhen I first played Super Mario  as a kid I was amazed I never even had the game though Heck I never had a Nintendo  This game like many other Nintendo  titles encouraged me to go out and buy myself a Nintendo   years after its release I used to play this game with friends and cousins Playing it now brings back such great memories This game is what a game is all about An unforgettable story an interesting environment and overall FUN This game doesnt get old In my opinion it beats out most modern games today Super Mario  formed the basis for all Dimensional video games If you were considering getting this game dont consider any longer GET ITSuper Mario  one of the greatest games for N

StoryPlot the Story begins with a letter from Princess Peach inviting Mario to come to her castle for a cake she has baked for him However when he arrives Mario discovers that Bowser has invaded the castle and imprisoned the princess and her servants within it using the power of the castles  Power Stars Many of the castles paintings are portals to other worlds in which Bowsers minions keep watch over the stars Mario explores the castle for these portals to enter the worlds and recover the stars He gains access to more rooms as he recovers more Power Stars and eventually traverses three different obstacle courses each leading to its own battle with Bowser Defeating Bowser the first two times earns Mario a key for opening another level of the castle After Mario defeats Bowser in the final battle Peach is released from the stainedglass window above the castles entrance Peach rewards Mario by kissing him on the nose and baking the cake that she had promised him

Gameplay Each course is an enclosed world in which the player is free to wander in all directions and discover the environment without time limits The worlds are filled with enemies that attack Mario as well as friendly creatures that provide assistance offer information or ask a favor such as pink peaceloving Bobomb Buddies The player gathers stars in each course some stars only appear after completing certain tasks often hinted at by the name of the course These challenges include defeating a boss solving puzzles racing an opponent and gathering coins As more stars are collected more areas of the castle hub world become accessible The player unlocks doors in the castle with keys obtained by defeating Bowser in special courses There are many hidden minicourses and other secrets to the game most containing extra stars needed to complete the game entirely Some courses contain cannons that Mario can access by speaking to a pink Bobomb Buddy After entering a cannon Mario can be shot out to reach distant places When the player has the Wing Cap equipped cannons can be used to reach high altitudes or fly across most levels quickly

The gameplay and control is fricken awesome u can control mario in more ways then 

Power ups Some courses have special cap powerups which augment Marios abilities The Wing Cap allows Mario to fly the Metal Cap makes him immune to most damage allows him to withstand wind walk underwater and be unaffected by noxious gases and the Vanish Cap renders him partially immaterial and allows him to walk through some obstacles such as wire mesh as well as granting invulnerability to some forms of damage

Abilities Mario can wall jump long jump and many more

Music the Music is all original nothing has been copied but the game music is awesome for each stage In short Super Mario  is a great game and it deserves respect
This game is a must get in your video game collection This game also started the trend where super games have  in their name for example Donkey Kong  Super Mario Kart  Pilotwings  and Super Man 
Story  Gameplay  Music  Powerups  Overall   AThis great game is commonly overshadowed by the INFERIOR N Zelda games If you have the N without this game what are you waiting for Buy this game Super Mario  has GREAT gameplay sound effects music graphics and an excellent intro to top it all offI remember the first time I laid eyes on this game I had been hearing about how awesome the Nintendo  was going to be from schoolmates as we eagerly anticipated the USA release of this system I remember hearing how in demand it was and the ensuing shortage for the upcoming Christmas before I even saw it Then one day I was Christmas shopping with my dad and happened to come across a demo setup in the mall and I finally got to see what the massive hype was about

The game was bright and colorful and Mario was fully D A large crowd had gathered around to catch a glimpse of the latest in video game technology and I only lingered for a moment yet my first impression is still fresh in my memory Mario  looked like nothing I had ever seen before and also looked leaps and bounds better than anything I had ever seen on Playstation Sega Saturn or any other system I was very impressed

Several months later I finally saved up enough money to purchase the system bundled with Mario  I loved the game dearly back then and to this day I still love this game It still looks feels and plays unlike any other game that came out during that era While Zelda Ocarina of Time is similar graphicswise that game is so great in its own right that both games deserve to be recognized separately

Mario  is a perfect launch game for the Nintendo  home console system Looking at the controller for the N one might have been understandably skeptical due to the layout However Mario  is actually very easy to control and is a good introduction to getting gamers accustomed to the new feel of the controller and its new button layout

When I say the controls for this game are very simple I must also mention that Mario is capable of many actions Mario can walk run crawl jump triple jump backflip side somersault wall kick swim climb punch kick slide fly shoot from a cannon buttsplash hang handoverhand crouch surf on koopa shells and even look around While this scope of actions seems like a lot and likely difficult to master the reality is that yes it is alot but is not difficult at all to master A few of the skills such as wall kicking or flying take some practice to master but the majority of Marios actions are very easy to master which results in very fluid gameplay and the sensation of actually being Mario

The camera angles are manageable considering you have control over them You might find yourself slightly frustrated with it in certain enclosed areas such as Boos Haunted House but for the most part the camera angles are very functional The gameplay is extremely fun with a very gradual learning curve While you only need  stars to complete the game players looking to oneup the challenge can elect to try and collect all  stars which requires true mastery of the game

The music is outstanding Koji Kondo also famous for the Ocarina of Time music did all the music for Mario  and succeeded in composing very memorable and enjoyable tunes My personal favorite is and will always be the Jolly Rodger Bay  Dire Dire Docks music

The level design is unique with some truly large levels offering tons of exploration Mario will find himself in sunken ships caves with toxic gas inside a volcano a pyramid in a desert a fortress in the sky sliding down slippery snowy slopes and even inside a giant strange clock This game is filled with fun challenges and hours of terrific gameplay I dont believe Ive ever met anyone that didnt find this game fun to play

No Luigi is not in the game There was a major hoax citing ridiculous methods that would unlock Luigi but all proved untrue Kind of strange Luigi wasnt in the game but not that big of a deal

Mario  is well loved and remembered but it is kind of strange that the Nintendo s launch game is almost incomparable to the entire library of games that followed Super Mario World on Super Nintendo was a gem but there were other great games in the SNES library However with the Nintendo  Super Mario  along with Zelda Ocarina of Time stand head and shoulders above pretty much every game in the Nintendo  library which is disappointing considering that we see the Nintendo  was capable of supporting topnotch games The Nintendo  library just didnt manage to produce games that lived up to the original launch game

In the end Mario  will always be remembered as the revolutionary classic that literally defined the Nintendo bit eraI didnt use to be into Mario or Kirby but now I like them both as much as I like the Legend of Zelda series I still have many more games to purchase based on those  characters But I think SuperMario  is a great story game a killer for the old games meant for the gameboy So enjoyI grew up playing Super Mario  If you are considering buying this game dont hestitate or think twice This game is really fun It can keep you entertained for hours The graphics are simply stunning even by todays standards considering the age of this game It is a CLASSIC MUST HAVE for any N players Mario fans or video game fanaticsThis game is really good It was the launch title for the Nintendo  Its a full D world The objective of the game is to collect the Power Stars in Princess Peachs Castle to get to the top of the castle to fight Bowser and save the princess  stars out of the  are required to face Bowser This game is really big too you can fly turn invisible and go through certain types of walls and turn into metal The game is really good and I would recommend this to anyone who has a N If you dont have a N you can get it from the Virtual Console service on Wii for about  bucksMy six year old grandson has had many hours of enjoyment especiall after receiving this cartridge and his console which shipped in another order Everything was smooth and merchandise arrived in excellent condition and in time prescribedWhen i got my n years ago i bought mario kart  and i liked it 
But i never bought mario  i played it and completed it though I loved mario  the gameplay is awesome the graphics are cool for that times The only thing i regret is that i never bought it to have it as a memento of my n gaming times

I loved it so much that i tried to find it in a market i found a lot of n games but not mario  I just wanted to play it one last time to remember the good old days of n gaming So i had to download a n emulator and play it but its not the same to play with a keyboard than to play with the joystick Anyway i could play the entire game and that made me happy

For all those people who played the good old days of n should have this game because is a memory of the n and the good old times of gamingThis is so classic and we love it Dont forget to buy a rumble pack so you can feel when you crash or go over the railroad tracksThis product is very good and works fine Buy it if you want it it lets your we display in HD format of p which looks alittle better than normal Av cable it comes with To the untrained eye you might not even notice the diffrenceIn these decades of the digital world with superior hardware and high definition graphics I dont believe gamers will ever encounter the same life changing experience as those who have first hand seen Mario evolve into a D masterpiece  The Nintendo  is the best console of its time HANDS DOWN and Super Mario  is a MASTERPIECEI dont know how many times Ive played this game from start to finish
Like a lot of people my decision to buy a N was based on the Mario  commercials
The WOW factor was in full effect
When I got home and started playing it literally felt like the first time I experienced Atari or the Sega Genesis
Blown away would be an understatement

The game itself
Perfection even with a few minor things

The good
M ushered in a whole new age of platforming
Brought us D platfroming that was just about perfect in every way
The graphics for its time were second to none
The control was spot on
The story line was simple but cute like all Mario games
Hidden secrets like being able to wall jump up to the roof
I could go on and on

The bad
My only gripe is the camera
The camera can get quite wonky in places and funnyeven to this day bad cameral angles still plague D games
Nintendo and other companies have for the most part gotten the camera down with the free moving camera feature Too bad some companies are still completely clueless

To summarize
Perfection
Groundbreaking
A legend that spawned a thousand imitators some good mostnot so good
Cant beat the original
Highest recommendationsI have a  and  year old whom which are addicted to this game The game is genius in the way it makes the use of logic mandatory but not so difficult to cause frustration Save money buy buying a N system and this game in comparison to a PS or a XBOXRight off the bat before it came out youd probably wonder how would you ever imagine Mario in D Well heres your answer Mario 

Theres  huge courses with  missions in each Counting  coin stars with stars for rewards Those stars help you unlock more levels

At the time no one ever saw anything like this before Although the graphics look fairly primitive now they were still eye candy for most Mario fans especially back then

Super Mario  plays how a D game should be played like With a free camera flawless control and extremely playable environments

Getting all  stars is the real challenge SPOILER ALERT If you do manage to get them all you get to visit Yoshi on the castle roof and he will give you  lives along with an improved triple jump move

Overall you know what I want you to do so do it Buy the gameWhy is this on the list because for the time it was the cream of the crop And its also one of the funnest Mario games youll ever play The worlds look great lots of free roaming and neverending gameplay is why this game makes the list Still love itSuper Mario  is a great game and is what I would call the best platforming game of all time

PROS
 Memorable music and imaginative courses
 Game play is always straightforward and never confusing
  stars to collect for long playing time
 Graphics were great back when it was made and is not painful to look at now

CONS
 While this game does have replay value you arent compelled to play again after you beat it Give it a while and you will definitely want to play again

This game was not too hard for me and I beat it when I was in the singledigits as a child That given it shouldnt be too hard for any age Buy this game now if you havent ever played it since it is one of those video games you have to beatSuper Mario  is a game Ive wanted to play for ages I finally decided to purchase it and I was not disappointed In my opinion Super Mario  is the best in the Mario series and one of the best games ever This game was a breakthrough in Dplatformers and its easy to see why The D is great for its time and the style is incredible

The game is addictive as well I would play for hours and hours and wouldnt want to stop and Super Mario  does not get tiresome after you beat it for the first time

The plot is simple Bowser kidnaps Princess Peach and Mario must save her But the plots not important in a video game The game play is what matters

The game is fast paced and you always have new areas to unlock Despite not having any other areas to go to outside of Princess Peachs castle there are tons of areas inside Getting to new areas is simple You need a certain amount of stars to unlock doors and unlock enough doors to unlock boss doors Overall there are  stars in the entire game and I would recommend a guide because of how challenging it is

When battling Bowser in this game I was disappointed Hes so easy When I beat him the first time I was surprised how easy he was It was more difficult getting to Bowser than it was battling him But all three incredible boss stages that were before the battles are so much fun it makes up for it

There are also hidden items characters and power ups for Mario to find

Now there are a few problems like any other game that I think are quite frustrating Marios controls sometimes are a little tough His wall jumps have to be so precise and if you mess up you have to do it again and again and the camera sometimes can be tough to use in certain areas But despite these problems its still a great game

This game is a must own for Mario fans While yet you must already know this since Im writing this review thirteen years later  

Super Mario  will always be known as one of the best Dplatformers in video game historyI played this game when it first came out at a friends house but i never bought it I was not that in to the  back then But now i think it is very fun and entertaning The graphics r good for the  including that it was the first game ever for it That is why almost everyone who has a  has this game If u take the snes newest games graphics compared to this game which is only a couple years apart these graphics seem life like It has a great adventure but its weird that Luigi is not in this game It adds much more new itemscharectersand levels I like that it is first person view unstead of the side view like on the past marios Ever since this game most marios have been first person view This is why i want sm ds it is like the s but different graphics and differnent layouts I will get the ds one in the future but thats a different story Like i said my top favorite game todayOkay so when I decided I wanted to buy a new nintendo  my brain automatically said now where can I find super mario Hours upon hours were spent on this game when I was a tweenager and I had so much fun with it So I went out as soon as I could and bought it again

I was kind of worried because I had gotten some games with my system that I used to this were fun also but they ended up being a little too easy since Im older now but when I got this and played it it was exactly the same Some easy levels and some that take forever to get through but in a good way

I have had it for a month now and havent gotten bored with it yet So I recommend this game to people of all ages I even let my  year old brother try it out and he had a blast even though he had no clue how to really navigate 

BUY ITA fun game all the way You just cant get enough of this fantastic wonderful gamethis is an amazing game one that you can enjoy playing from the start to the finishEvery now and then a start this game up from scratch and go seeking the  stars and the battles with Bowser  What makes this game so fun is that even though you master it there are several stars that are just so hard to get again I dont know how many times I need to race the penguin down the chute before I can get one of the tougher stars

I really love the music and the toughness of Mario as he beats the baddies into submission with kicks punches and smashes  Though the graphics may pale by todays standards they seemed so far ahead of their time when the game was introduced it was one of the first D graphic games around

I never tire of itThis game is more fun than I expected  I am really pleased with the way Mario can moveWhen I first saw Super Mario  in  I had to pick my jaw up off the ground  While  years have passed I still consider this game of the finest pieces of entertainment I have ever seen  The kinds of things that the development team pulled off in the mid s set the stage for all future video game development and it was is and always will be groundbreaking

An achievement that should not be ignored and is still as much fun today as it was a decade DECADE ago

 HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATIONIm not quite finished with the games DiRT Tour mode but I believe Ive experienced the bulk of what the game has to offer  And Im happy to say that the game is indeed awesome  Great cars great tracks and racing modes excellent gameplay and graphics  The highlight has been racing in the snow on various tracks in Aspen  There are also some really cool obstacle courses on pavement which are new to the series

At first I felt that the game was plagued with the same difficulty spike DiRT  had where you can win any race without trying on casual difficulty then lose big time on medium  Then I found the custom difficulty settings where you can choose from  levels of challenge then pick and choose from all the other assists and handling options  Basically you can let the game play itself by just holding the throttle and steering or take gradual steps to reach what you feel works best for you  Love this feature  Sadly there is no option to increase the  controllers dead zone or adjust the sensitivity  Im doing ok as is but some tweaking would be ideal

Much like the previous two games the handling is a bit flighty  But thats speeding on loose ground for you  Still I feel things have tightened up somewhat since DiRT   Still no cigar but its a step forward  The game runs as smooth as silk on my ti wih all the settings maxed  No issues whatsoever  If you enjoy racing games this is not one you should ignore  Its the best DiRT so farThis game was one of my favorite games on the None of  or anyway this game is stunning graphicly for its time and the gameplay is a blast and challenging

you can find this game on any emulator sitecheck it outThis game is great I played a friends and then they gave it to me Ive beat it I still have to try to get all the stars but I will The game is REAL fun and interactive with many great lands and levels to get the stars and fun bosses The game is just REALLY great I really love it IT ROCKSThis is it The ground breaking game that shot the Nintendo  sells thorough the roof and off to space Super Mario  is a game that cant be found anywhere else It is truly amazing in every aspect from stunning graphics to superbly versatile gameplay I just couldnt believe that this game could be this good even though it is so oldyes it is OLD now This game was so dang much fun that they even made it for Nintendo DS If you are looking for one amazing game and own the best system ever madeNintendo NOT Xbox Playstsion  or Xbox  then look for Super Mario  You will not be dissapointed GuaranteedSuper Mario  was and still is one of the best and most revolutionary video game ever made  The game was a launch title for the Nintendo  and boy did the game make its mark on the console  Sure we have games like Banjoe Kazooi Ocarina of Time but this game was the first to come out and is still an instant class and started many many famous game rippoffsLike many people say Banjoe Kazooi was a ripoff but I DIDNT SAY THAT so dont flame mebut thats beyond the point this game is still one of the most beloved video game ever  When Super Mario  launched with the N it was indeed a very revolutionary game it was the first game to present d platforming state of the art graphics and some of funnestbest gameplay youll see in platformingaction games  The game is HUGE  In Mario  you WILL be going through many many stages to collect stars so you can unlock more areas for more stars and ultimatley put the evil bowser to an end and once again save Princes Peach  I was one of many people who first played this game back when it launched with the Nintendo  and when you compare it to todays games the gameto many but not melooks terrible but you gotta understand the time this game was releasedit was INFACT the best looking video game everperiodand even today when I play this classic it still looks amazing  Call me crazy but I seriously still think this is one of the best looking video games of not only the mid s but even today it is still marvalous  The music in Mario  was just plain perfect the music blended in with the games levels and star hunting words cannot explain how well Miyamoto and Nintendo did for the musicits just plain good  The controls are also tight and well focused I especially love the array of moves Mario has and although the controls may feel abit clumsy at times it never bothered me once  As for camera yes there were times were I wanted to break the tv but the reward and satisfaction of getting a star after that trouble feels so good  Audio controls graphics are all A and as for gameplayWell it dependsDo you like platformingactionexploringcollecting games because you will be collecting pretty much for the whole gameStars duuhhhand if the answer is yes then this may be the best game youve ever played  Now for me the gameplay was truly fun and innovative I never got bored once in this game  Its so fun hunting for stars never gets annoying or frustraiting  Speaking of difficulty the game is perfect its not hard nor is it easy like pieacctually I take that back for many people this game will be easy if you wanna just beat the plotbut it just gets it right on difficulty I dont remember ever being frusraited or angry with the gamethen again I never did try to get all  starsand just having a great time with the gameit seriously is one of the funnest experiences Ive ever had with a game and as I said beforethis game is revolutionary  Now that Im done ranting and talking about this game Ill just get to it quickly

The Good
One of the best and most revolutionary game everperiod
Back then and even today it is still one of the best looking video games ever made
Loads of things to do
Not hard but not too easy its juuuust about right
The game is just plain fun the moves the platforming collecting ect
Collecting stars is really fun
The music in this game is just plain fun to listen to
Though the bosses are easy I still think theyre just classics
Will take a very long time to get all  stars and collecting  stars means spending lots of time with this amazing title
The worlds and places you visit are all so different and an amazment to look at

The Bad
Some may feel that game is feeling abit dated nowthe game is pretty old now
Some will find the graphics to be terrible or just bad which I find hard to believe
People who just want to beat the games plot and nothing els shouldnt even touch the gamebecause the game doesnt take too long to beat for plot and if youre planning on not having a fun time with the game and just wanting to beat the game and getting it over with whats the point of that
Some will be angry with the camera
Alot of people today or in the future may get this game and probably nag about how easy the bosses are well cry me a river if you want a hardboss go play something elsother then that get ready to play one of the best games ever

Overall Super Mario  stands up on its own  The game was indeed revolutionary and braught us amazing visuals superb gameplay and great controlls aswell as a fun adventurelike plot with lots of collecting to do  The games music was just great to listen to the places the game takes you are just so fun and innovative and the movesmechanics that are enabled for Mariothough limitedare great  The game is just plain great  As I stated before it is one of the best video games ever made and it indeed gets a perfect

 out of  starsThis game was a very fun game You basicly go to a castle and you jump into a paintings each one leading you into a different world and in every world you have to find  stars one of em is the  coin star where you need to collect  coins then it pops up its the hardest star to gettheres  worlds in all most worlds take hours to complete so this game well be well worth it This game right here is history Its one of Nintendos biggest hits and when you buy this game youll soon find out whyI stand behind this game being the best Super Mario game nintendo has produced Too bad it was on a system that people didnt enjoy  too many complaints over the control and the game selection and graphics capability it was a true underdog But Super mario  has so many good qualities

this game takes forever to beat Some may think this is a nusance but its filled with many many wonderful levels of fun

each level is unique and its organized in a wonderful fashion you never get too confused in nagivating the game

There is ALWAYS something new to find and many races and somewhat minigames that are actually entertaining and not ultimately annoy you

You get frusterated when you lose you realize this isnt some easy game  you can breeze through its actually difficult  appreciate that challenge because challenge is hard to come by in games these days

Graphics arent overdone Good you can find flaws especially these days the angles may alert some gamers as being old fashioned but think about it like this its not D lol

Overall I love this game Without a doubt I consider it amongst the top  of my favorite games If you havent played this game you are really missing out on something go play it youll see how fun and exciting this game can be and believe me  it only gets betterWhen this game came out it was like a historic event  It felt like there was no longer a limit to what video games could do  Every toy store had a booth set up where you could give this game a try  It was amazing to play and amazing to see

This game is still amazing  The play control is amazingly smooth and you can make mario do some unbelievable things  The worlds are amazing  You can go wherever you want to go do whatever you want to do

Just look at the difference between this game and the original Super Mario Bros for NES  My gosh the difference is astounding  Its amazing how Nintendo could take something so great and make it hundreds of times better in less than two decades  Sometimes I love progressOkaythe game is very addicting The soundgraphicsgameplay is all great But I discoverd something else funer Super Mario  DS That game is way better This game is good but that game is something you cant keep your eyes off Remember when you finish the game and eyerything to do and theres nothing left to do well this DS game has mini games They are very addicting and fun You can draw on this as well The adventure mode takes longer folks You can play as YoshiLuigiMario Wario In The beginning of Super Mario you could just walk in But thwe DS version is different You have to collect a rabbit to get in There is more rooms in this castle too with more levels Instead of collecting  stars You have to collect  If you dont have enogh money for a DS and the game but have a Ndust off the original and have some fun Or go out and buy your DS and game Get whatever You have to play this though If you dont think Im rightthen you will be sorryOne of the best games of its time and is still considered by many to be one of the best games ever made I highly recommed this gameMy  year old son decided to murder my gamepad and this is EXACTLY what i needed to repair it The damage appeared to be from a red ink pen which he furiously scrubbed into the screen after he removed my screen protectornot a good day for anyone The touch screen and its hard cover were both damaged

Before you buy this part look up some youtube videos on how to replace it and decide if youre comfortable doing this It took me about an hour or two to cautiously tear apart and replace it You will also need a special tri wing screwdriver to open the casing Its nothing overly complicated but you will be tearing your gamepad down to its bare bones since the screen in on the bottom of the device

The screen i received had black trim on the front which matched my black gamepad Your mileage may vary on the color since it didnt specify in the item listing

In the end I replaced the screen and saved myself the pain of buying a newusedrefurb gamepad for  If done properly no one will ever know you opened the gamepad There are no seals to break or anything that would tip off Nintendo or Gamestop that youve tampered with it in the event you send it in for warranty or trade it inHeres a cool trickyou have to have the nd key you get from Bowser
TopicSnowman has your hat
Sent in fromAnubis
Get your blown off by the big snowman Dont pick your hat up at all Instead go get a star It dosnt have to be a new starand save and turn off N Wait  secondsnow turn N back on
Go back to that level and one of the little snowmen that pops out of the snow will have Marios hat on their headSuper Mario  is one of the best games ever Its a classic no Mario fan should be without it Now onto the reveiw
Controls
Its pretty good compaired to some games but most games have much smoother control But since this is one of the first N games Im going to give it a good rating considering there are no PSs GCs or Xboxs
Theres marios famous jump double jump and triple jump The double and triple jumps can be performed by timing when you press the A button
There is also the groundpound aka buttstomp and other confusing jumps Also Mario can pick up and throw various items climb walls using the wall jumpand punch and kick
The reson why this games getting a  is because some jumps can be hard to master and controlling Mario can sometimes be hard
Graphics
Like I saidThis is one of the first Nintendo  games So its okay that the graphics are a little blocky and not very detailed The graphics are very well done
Replay Value
The point of the game is to retrieve all of the castles power stars and save princess Peach There are  in all You only need  to beat the game Sure its fun to go back and beat the game a couple more times But how much time are you going to spend getting all Some stars are very hard to get and after a couple of times you might get frusterated and just give up
Overall
Super Mario  is a brilliant game Mario can be turned into metal Mario invisible and fly by wearing special caps that last a certain amount of time He can shoot from cannons and swing Bowser around by the tail The courses are cleverly designed everything is almost perfect I use the word almost because nothing is perfectREGISTER NOW

By now many Mario fans have taken a look at either the Japanese or US version of Super Mario  so well spare you most of the hype and rhetoric Having said that it must be stated that SM is the greatest videogame to date and one which all games regardless of genre will be judged henceforth Nintendo set itself a nearly impossible goal and achieved it with SM Look closely Marios lineage is D  not ideal material upon which to base the most intensely scrutinized D videogame ever But videogames are in the end meant to entertain And entertainment is at the heart of this fantastic title
Like many previous Mario games experimentation is integral to the experience of playing You must explore everything leave no rock unturned no mushroom mute no door unopened Mario himself has so many possible movements and the environment is so intensely interactive that even the least experimental players will spend hours on the first level without achieving anything in particular The game is initially less accessible than previous Mario titles although the threepronged analog controller isnt really where the difficulty lies  the joypad itself performs excellently Overall the biggest obstacle in the game is finding the correct viewpoint The camera which moves on its own unless directed manually by using the four gold buttons tries to find the optimal angle to view the action though occasionally youre simply not able to see where youre going Additionally frustration sets in as you spin the camera around while simultaneously attempting to run across a moving plank or tiptoeing across a tiny ledge But getting the hang of SM is all a matter of practice  and as soon you catch on you will execute these skills unconsciously The variety of levels and scale each world is simply breathtaking The game consists of  massive courses in which Mario can attain seven stars per course with numerous secret areas and bonuses including  extra stars for a total or  stars Itll surely take the average gamer  hours to reach the third and final Bowser and free the princess not to mention find Yoshi so the games replay value is bountiful And despite all of their saccharinsweet cuteness the graphics are magnificent Shigeru Miyamotos dream of producing an interactive cartoon has been fully realized  the animation is lavish the textures rich and even the most superfluous touches have been completely executed SM is not perfect however Despite the efficiency of the hardwares Load Management drawin is noticeable and occasionally gamers will look right through walls or objects Still this is as close to perfection a game has ever been bit no less Super Mario  also puts Nintendos preference of silicon over CDs to the test with pleasingly familiar results Most owners of either a Saturn or a PlayStation or both have by now acclimated to long load times though grumblingly Super Mario  will remind them of how gaming used to be load time is nil and reaching a playable level is only a matter of seconds From the time you switch on the unit until youre done the flow is seamless and moving from one game area to another is instantaneous Nintendos musical prodigy Koji Kondo turns in an inspired performance somehow finding room on the small cartridge to create the appropriate music for each world Even though some tracks are cheesy others like the sitarladen score of the first fire level are more than effective in setting the mood for the level and are as atmospheric as any Redbook audio Also impressive are the sound effects Marios onscreen antics are matched by grunts whoops and hollers fleshing out his spunky personality As a whole the flagship N game more than makes up for any painful delay or delays imposed upon the units release SM is complete in every way and the challenging experience of working toward each new level is far greater than the games minimal flaws Nintendos craftsmanship and zeal for creating fantastically enjoyable games has never shown through more than in Super Mario  Nintendo s early flagship title demonstrates the power of the hardware as well as the creative genius of Miyamoto and team Not only does the game obliterate every platformer before it in terms of visual finesse it plays just as well if not infinitely better than previous D incarnations of the Mario franchise D worlds are huge and cleverly laidout so that theres never a dull moment Secrets play a huge part of the experience recapturing the classic gameplay style of the series In fact this game is exactly as one might hope it would be Mario in D More freedom more space more options better graphics improved and elaborated control schemes  its all there Possibly the greatest videogame achievement ever Dont rent BuyNo matter how many times you beat this game you still want to play it again and again Its because its tons of fun to get stars but also because the graphics are extremely well done and take up almost all of the systems power Every level is great and the graphics are still awesome up to this day In fact I like the visuals in this game more than some of the games for the  bit Game Cube including Super Mario Sunshine The game play is very simple and easy but still manages to never lose a players interest I like to think of Super Mario  as a visually breathtaking masterpiece The graphics are so awesome and the gameplay is very addictive even if youve already beaten the game  times it just never gets old
  Also I heard a rumor that there is going to be a sequal called Super Mario  I hope it is even better than Super Mario  with harder challenges and more levels Lets hope it has some of the things we love about Mario  plus great new surprisesI only bought a N recently but played it numerous times at friends houses  Ive already got a PS with  games and  for the N and have played god knows how many others but I have to say that Super Mario  is on my top  listI got this game MANY years ago for the N and I just loved it The game presented a large challenge while at the same time made it very fun The music is the best heard in a game the graphics are superb for an N title and this Mario game is a blast I guess the most noticeable feature are the environments that the game provides Every environment that Mario enters is just awesome I especially love the Rainbow level and the Snow level where all of the penguins are The best feature is the fact that every age group can enjoy the hours of entertainment from the game and they can all enjoy collecting stars from each stage to save Peach and defeat Bowser Oh by the way the Bowser levels are AWESOME Fighting Bowser himself is very fun as well The game is also good in the fact that it provides unsatirical yet not stupid humor as well This is great for younger gamers I guess the worst part of Super Mario  is the lack of replayability Its like Vice City where it will take months to play and finish the game but once its done you wont want to play it again without getting bored Once the rides over youll feel like you cant go play it each day and the game is kind of wasted in that aspect Overall if you are a fan of Mario or Nintendo then this game may just be suited for your needs My ratingThis game is coooooollll Me Abigail has this game and I have  stars They were soo easy to find I do not know how I became an expert at this For your information I am an expert in all of my video games I must feel like the luckiest girl in the world But Ill give you a little info
Title Rainbow ride Star
Youll have to take another magic carpet ride through lowflying areial obstacles to reach the cloud house The blue blocks that float in your way are bigger on this carpet ride and youll have to jump on them quickly before the carpet moves out from under your feet The Magic Carpet will take you through the cloud house twice On both trips whatch out for the jet of fire that comes out from the fireplace Its best to stay to the rear of the carpet until the fire is out then go to theleading ledge of the carpet If you get knocked off the carpet its a log trip back to a spot where you can remount it theres a warp to the top of the maze on the Cloud House Balconythe installation took a bit of work youtube videos help quite a bit
but what the video I watched DID NOT MENTION is that if you replace your touch screen with this then youll see a very noticeable silver boarder around your screen that is from the LCD panel its self
youll need your old screen SO DONT TROW it out yet youll need to pry off the plastic black square carefully and place it on your new touch screen
With this installed the black square will cover up the silver boarder and make your tablet look just like when it was fresh out of the boxSuper Mario is arguably the most successful and most recognizable brand name in the history  It seems that every time Nintendo releases a new episode in the series it hits video gaming gold  From the earliest release of the original Super Mario Brothers on the original Nintendo Entertainment System it has always been a hit  Even lesser known titles in the series like Super Mario World  Yoshis Island stay faithful to the series and produce very entertaining gameplay  With the dawn of Nintendos three dimensional  degree rotating platform Nintendo  the question became Could Nintendo maximize the potential of this new platform and give Mario a fresh angle  The answer in the form of Super Mario  proved to be a quite emphatic YES

Super Mario  takes the technique of multiple goals for each level introduced in Super Mario World and expands it in a quite impressive manner  There are  worlds Mario must navigate in an effort to free the Princess who is trapped in paintings in her castle  The goal is to accumulate at least  stars to unlock the passage way the final battle with Bowser  As each world contains  stars of its own in addition to  bonus stars around the castle it would seem to be a walk in the park  However all is not as it seems  Several of the doors leading the different worlds are sealed off either by locks or star requirements  Therefore there is a limited amount of ways to accumulate the necessary stars until more stars are attained or earlier battles with Bowser are won  Of course this leads to a journey through amazing worlds were Mario travels the depths of the ocean soars in the open sky battles over scorching lava and even gets to sneak through a haunted house  The variety of worlds and objectives are truly amazing as are the new moves Mario can make to help accomplish these goals  No longer content to just move forward and jump Mario can now do backflips long jumps wall leaps and crawls

One other aspect of Super Mario  that makes it standout is its use of rotating camera angles to track Marios movements through each world  It takes some getting used to but it enables a truly three dimensional feel  This is game that Nintendo built its release of Nintendo  around  It delivered magnificently then and with its continual replay value still delivers todayIt was incredible to see this game when it came out in  my brother and I had our minds blown We lived in this game and Mario Kart and thought entertainment would never be the same Years ago this was the one word on Videogames it revolutionized everything and no one has duplicated it A mustown and play Itsjust incredibleThis game is great and fun to play They are many powers that you can get like flying and so on The color of the background is alright The color looks smooth and rich and bright
There are lot of bosses that you have to beat and alot of stars to find In order to fine them look very very hard you never know a star could be under your nose
The levels are cooler and better than the other old mario games that I playden in a long time
The levels can be very very hot or very cold places or the levels can have water so you have to swim Or some of the levels can be nice or normal
In the game Mario can do some cool moves like back flip and so on In the levels you dont get one star there are many stars in one level Each level has many stars to fine Get the stars and be very very powerfulI think Mario is a  great game Fighting Bowser is the funnest part in this game The best part is when you see Yoshi Yoshi gives you  lives Its fun looking for Marios cap when Mario loses his cap The game is one of the first D and is very good game for N Even thoughGameCube has the best graphics the game is very graphical game The game may have many challenges even after you get  stars This Mario game is very fun for N and I have to say this is one of the greatest hits Ive ever had for NSo what is Marios quest this time Save the Princess Peach by defeating the evil Bowser while collecting  stars in only  levels all  levels are contained in  huge castle It might not be the best Mario game but it offers a new D world and a whole new realism It also has new features such as an energy feature where rather than collecting powerups like the fire flower you now collect a gold coin and you get a block of energy back Now Mario has far more of an offense rather than just stomping enemies he can now throw punches kicks and slide into enemies making full use of the D plane The enemies come to life in D such as huge chain chomps menacing goombas and annoying koopas The graphics could have been better because they make enemies out of simple colors rather than textures like more recent games have The music and sound effects are nice because Mario now has a voice to be heard There are however only minimal powerups such as Marios Winged hat which allows him to fly and Marios steel cap making him invincible was a fairly important year in the realm of video gaming The Super Nintendo Entertainment System dies out in the United States Diablo comes out for the PC However the biggest news is the launch of Nintendos amazing new system the Nintendo  which was lauded for its beautiful graphics and a brilliant new controller
Two games were released along with the system There was Pilotwings  which was not exactly what was expected but the other game was called the greatest game of all time as of  that is at least in the eyes of critics by several source And it really was
The first thing that strikes your eyes is its delicious eye candy The first thing that pops out at you after the title is Giles Goddards Mario face And boy does it look good But enough with the intro Its time to see whether the game itself passes the graphics test
Answer Yes it does Even after five years Super Mario  is still one of the most beautiful games for Nintendos crowning glory speaking from a fanboys POV The character and tree designs are very outdated by todays standards but the water is still lovely though surpassed and some of the brick and stone backgrounds still are the most realistic that I have ever seen Today the graphics would get a C by reviewers but back in  this game would get an A
But who cares how it looks Lets see how it sounds
The answer Great Before  Nintendo fans never had a chance to hear Mario talk but the first thing that greets you when you turn on the system is a jingle and the words Itsa me Mario and Hello while a remixed version of the classic Mario theme plays in the back But again this is only the intro The question is whether games sounds that good
The answer naturally would be even better Mario comes packed with a large batch of sayings including Mama mia Here we go and Press start to play Unfortunately everything else other than Peach and Bowser dont talk in anything else other than words But remember the fact that this is a first generation cartridge game and if people complain for Zelda then they shouldnt complain here
The music and sound effects are just divine Outside the castle you are greeted with the happy chirping of birds and the roaring of a nearby waterfall Enter and the cozy castle theme starts playing Each of the levels come equipped with music that ranges from peaceful to energetic to somber The Bowser fight music ranges from rock to organ music and its all wonderful
Now that the graphics and the sound are out of the way lets get into the meat of the game the gameplay
The first thing most people would notice is how different this is from traditional Mario games There are only Up mushrooms and the only pipe that appears is in the very beginning However Super Mario  is D and most of those elements just wouldnt work in a D game
The story according to the manual is that Peach invites Mario over to the castle for a cake When Mario reaches the castle he is greeted with a gruff voice Wondering what went on Mario explores the rooms and finds a giant painting where he can jump in There he finds himself in a new world with a giant BobOmb on the top He fights and defeats it youll have to do that part yourself and gets a star Later he learns that Bowser has attacked the castle captured the Princess stolen the Power Stars and has sent his army to take over the worlds inside the paintings then the world itself
Yeah so it isnt much different from other Mario games but thats not the point The point is there are  stars out there although  is need to beat the game but wheres the fun in that for you to collect Your misson to explore  worlds to find those  stars
Well instead of having a Super Mario and a Mario like in past Mario games Mario has  life bars Hitting certain enemies would make him lose  life bars as well falling from semihigh heights Burning Marios butt will make him lose  Certain other enemies and falling from really high heights will make him lose  But dont worry Coins and water will replenish your health If you lose all  or fall down a pit you lose a life But for every  coins you get with a star and every Up Mushrooms you get a life
Your moves include the standard running punching buttstomping as well as the kick the longjump the wallkick the sidesomersault and the backflip You can also swim There are three special caps that gives you special abilities The Flying Cap gives you the ability to fly The Metal Cap gives you the ability to walk underwater and be immune to enemy The Vanish Cap gives you the ability to walk through enemies and certain walls Mario most employ all of those ablities to save the Princess and the world
The Nintendo  controller with its analog stick makes it possible for Mario to perform the tasks successfully Just imagine travelling in a D world with a Dpad Some people complain about the camera angles and how you have to control them with the Cbutton It may be annoying at first but eventually youll get used to it and itll come naturally and youll learn to play with the bad angles
Super Mario  not only has good graphics good sound and good gameplay but the fact that it is revolutionary in that it brings gaming into the D world makes it not only the best game of  but possibly also the best game ever Thats right even better than Castlevania and Super MetroidStill the best D game on the market Challenging tons of fun levels and amazing gameplay A true model for D gamesHello again friends What bad can be said about Mario  The polygons are smooth as silk very very VERY rare slowdown and the Mario we know and love
Can anyone guess what plumbers job is in this game Its to traverse  levels in search of Princess Peach On the way you have to stomp on Bowsers head Thrice All your favorite enemies are back with the exception of Koopa Troopas The goombas shy guy the Lakita Brothers the moles Bobombs everyones back
At a graphics standpoint Super Mario  is absolutely outstanding in every way shape and form Kudos to Nintendo  out of  for graphics
A great soundtrack and a great Mario voice make for a great overall sound  out of  for sound
The huge worlds will keep you coming back for more There is no way to put this thing down  out of  for replay
The final score Go look at the stars
See ya later Go buy this game Merry Christmas Luv yaThis game was the premiere launch game for the Nintendo  when it premiered and despite the fact that it is only a single played game pulls off fun gameplay and great graphics Despite the fact of newer systems like Xbox PS and even Nintendos own Gamecube I would still be happy to have this game sitting on my shelf next to games like Red Faction and Halo This game prved itself showing off the power that the Nintendo  had and showed it off to the loyal people who bought one instead of a PSX and even those who like me bought both a Nintendo  and a PSX But not to mince words Ill explain the game You are Mario one of the most well known characters in video game history You play through this adventure all in D This was one of the true selling factors of this game as it was Marios first true step into the Third Dimension Hushed Gasp But the game sold great and over time has proved in its own right that it is a classicThe Mario series from Nintendo has consistently produced games that are refreshing and innovative not to mention extremely addictive and fun to play  First there was the original Super Mario Brothers and Super Matio Brothers  for the NES to Super Mario World for the SNES and now Super Mario  for the N  The game is  years old now but its still just as fun to play as ever  The graphics and sound make excellent use of the Ns capabilities to create a D world that was just jawdropping in  and is still pretty awesome today
As others have said the basic story of the game is classic Mario  Bowser has kidnapped the Princess and Mario must rescue her  To do this he must collect a minimum of  stars from the  worlds in the game  These worlds are accessed by jumping through paintings and other objects scattered throughout the Mushroom Castle plus there are  stars contained within the castle itself  Although you only need  stars to finish the game there are a total of  stars available for collection and you wont be satisfied until you have collected each one  The  worlds have varying levels of difficulty but each and every world has some easy stars and some that are very difficult  It took me about  hours total to collect all  stars and rescue the Princess the first time  Each level has a different theme  Some are on mountains some are in waterfilled caves and there is one set inside a giant clock  My personal favorite is the haunted house level
The gameplay in Mario  is exceptional  Mario has many different types of moves ranging from tiptoeing around sleeping enemies to a great long jump to a very difficulttomaster wall jump  You must master all the moves if you expect to get all  stars  Also there are three special hats scattered throughout the game that allow Mario to fly walk underwater and become invisible  Again all are vital for  stars
After you finally win you might expect that you will never want to take on such a huge task again  But such is not the case  Even though you have all  stars you can go back to levels you have beaten and play them over and over as much as you want  Youll be tempted to do just that  The experience of playing through the incredible world of the Mushroom Castle is such that you will be coming back for many repeat visitsGreetings I am Oklonia My review of Super Mario  is right here
Super Mario  is a game that all master N gamers have to own
I dont even need to tell the story Whats happened The same traditional story Bowser kidnaps Princess Toadstool
Mario finds the princess rescues her and destroys Bowser
Capcise
The courses and stars names are quite creative eg Lil Penguin Lost They are more riddles though
The graphics are so sharp looking and realistic that maybe just a few could go on GameCube GCN
Despite a few annoying sounds and no multiplayer mode Super Mario  is really super
This has been OkloniaSuper Mario  was one of the first games for the Nintendo  and to this day is one of the best  Mario  is the beall and endall of d platforming  Mario has  stars to collect in many different worlds  Mario swims flies jumps runs and crawls  This game is immense fun and definitively replayable  A masterpeice by Shigeru MiyamotoThis is one of the best Mario games Ive ever played The game starts out when Mario gets a letter from Peach to come to the castle Mario is so excited he rushes to the castle When he gets inside he hears a voice that tells him to scram and thats when his adventure begins The first world is very easy but then they start getting more diffucult as you progress The thing that makes this better than any other mario game is that you have more enemies stars to collect a race with a penguin and much more If you dont have it yet buy itSuper Mario  When I first got Nintendo it came with Super Mario  When the system was hooked upI put in the gameand was amazed on how the graphics were It was excellent The graphics were greatthe music was cooland Mario never looked better This game is for everyone I thought BanjoKazooie was a great gamebut move over BanjoMario is back The best game ever Features new worldscharacterssettingand dont worry some of the old villians from the early Mario games are hereand cant forget Bowser and Princess ToadstoolPeachBetter than any  game ever madeSuper Mario  was the first game to be available for the N I remember the first time it came out how its graphics music and gameplay really amazed me Sadly very few games came after it to give much competition To this day it still remains one of the best N games out there The sheer scope of the game is enough to pick it up Its made up of  levels that can be played in a seminon linear order The graphics are bright and clear and the animations are creative for each character Gameplay is pretty deep but extremely intuitive and becomes second nature after playing for a short time The real plus in this game is the music some of the most catchiest to be written for a game to date Pick this one up for both its historical value and for the fact that its a great gameEven though this game is almost  years oldit is still one of the best games that the N has to offer  Why  Well dear reader I will tell you why  SUPER MARIO  is a gaming revolution  it was the game that everyone had to have  It took Mario into a whole new atmosphere  The world that is inside Princess Peachsaka Princess Toadstool castle is immense and highly imaginative  Although the graphics may seem a little bit datedit was a launch game remember that it is still a sight to see  As far as play control goes it is a bit difficult to get the hang of moving Mario around but once you get used to it then controlling Mario is a breeze  In fact it is some of the best playcontrol that a game has to offer  The Super Mario  storyline is familiar to Mario fans but at the same time a touch refreshing  Yes Peach is captured but she is being held prisnor in her own castlein a picture in fact and one of the funnest parts of the game is hanging out outside  One of my problems is that Luigi is not in the game in fact no mention of him is made either  Nintendo should have left the Mario Party franchise alone and focused on creating a Super Mario   but alas they didnt  So if you own a Nintendo  and dont have this title or are thinking of buying a N then get Super Mario  because it is by far a true gaming experienceSuper Mario  is a Classic pure and simple And theres not much else I can say Its a really good game With alot of stuff thats fun to come back and do You can fly around with your Wing cap Or Slide down a huge sliding board of Ice Mario  is Pure classic Pure funI can play this game comfortably on my old XP machine without a special video card Thats worth a lot in my book Not to mention the joy of spending most of my gaming time BUILDING rather than destroying However if you want you can sick all kinds of crises and destroy the city if you want sometimes thats fun This is a great strategy gameEver since I got this game Ive loved it i lost it so i recently had to buy another one but you get the hang of things pretty quickly very very fun gameDoes what it says it should do I dont use it much now that I have a PS again and a Nintendo  but my little brothers and sisters use it and it works just fine Toodleslot of people dont like RALLY because they already tried gran turismo game to tell you the truth gran turismo RALLY physic is just boring boring boring gran turismo only good for racing simulation but RALLY part is suck  dirt  amazed me how much fun it was and now dirt  with  time more race tracks than dirt   MUST BUYMy son sayes he is still learning how to customize the levels and is having some trouble changing ships He liked  better as it is easier to use Will get in there and read the bookSo I got this and first it was kind of tedious but then I added weather and well the titanic in a hurricane can be a hoot I got  cause my laptop is horridly slow but when I get my hands on more computer power Im going to get ship simulator extremes you tube gives you a good idea what to expect check it out there and see if its for youThe most amazing graphics you could see If you own a flight simulator yoke andor throttle quadrent you can make your gaming experice easier The Crash effects may not show in trailers or videos but in the actual game you can see the damage I higly recomend to purchase this product Happy Sailing To

December    I saw my review of the Internet and wanted to update it for you First of all anyone with this program BUY the extra environments and cars It is money well spent and a first class job of an addon I wanted everyone to know that this program is still the top of the heap in graphics I bought Battlefield  and it is good but not the standard of the ego  engine Codemasters are the king of graphics so far and I find that the more realism a game has the more adicted you will become No other program running with all variables to the max looks like Dirt  Thank God for codemasters and I can hardly wait for GRID  in the summercovers the controller more then others and is pretty durable great grip to it as well and keeps its color looks solidMy brother had one of these for the longest time so I used his until he wanted it back  I found this a lil while ago and have been loving it ever since giving the controller much needed grip and makes holding it for long gaming sessions much more comfortableAs soon as I slipped this on my controller I knew that Id never take it off  It makes the controller much more comfortable in your hands and does not slip if you play for a long time and tend to get sweaty fingersThis is a good buy but if you get the thumb grips for the xbox  controllers they will get stuck on the silicone so its not like the picture and it shows at the joystick the silicone is way back its really up close to the sticks and you will have to cut it back IF you get the thumb grips now it could just be only my silicone case but I dont knowIm revising my earlier review i had only rated my transaction  stars previously due to shipping problems After the seller contacted me to do what they could to help with the problem I have to reconsider They contacted me promptly and went above and beyond in their effort to make me happy Thank you This was the second case Ive purchased and would recommend it to anyone Thanks againThis thing is so inexpensive and makes the controller much more comfortable to hold for hours on end Item is very well manufactured and fits like a glove It also helps your hands breathe a little bit if you have sweaty hands For less than the cost of a gallon of gas You cant not afford to get this thing Better grip looks sharp and is thin enough that it does not make the controller more bulky in anywayeasy to put on and take off good grip cheap price just dont rip it apart to see how strong it is and write a review about it and its be fine DAwesome sillcone cover for my xbox  controller Fits well but collects dust sometimesEasy install and feels great The skin fits really well and functions properly I did have to trim up around the triggers because they moved around while I used them but after that it was perfectthis is a great quality skin I was surprised of how comfortable it is Especially how itd keep the controller cleanGrips the controller amazingly great for long gaming sessions as your hands get sweaty and hot during those times The cover literally wicks it away feels very rubbery yet thin enough to be really comfortable I simply love it it can get dirty since it catches dust rather easily nothing a little simple green and a wipe cant take care of  stars this product is absolutely needed wish the consoles came with it out of the boxnice skin for xbox controllers makes them more slip free and smooth softer too good deal and nice stuff try oneI love this thing It makes your controller look badass and is so soft  It has a great feel to it way better than plastic even if you have a Black controller this will improve it  The seams on the side are my only tiny concern  Add this with the Gripit blue analog covers and you have a great controller for cheap  I cant say enough about the comfort  fantasticConsidering its just a rubber cover for the XBOX  controller actually its made welland the pricenot bad at all Excellent product for an excellent controllerThis is the best ps memory card I know of Its perfect if you have games that take KB or more of your memory If you need more memory this is for youAnd at mb you will die before you run out of room on it

Put the card into your PS and boom it works Someone else suggested this and it worked like a charm Seems like they are tightened too much at the factory and in some way it interrupts the memory on the card

This card is great holds a ton of memory the most youll need really Havent had a problem with it since Fairly sturdy for what it isI like this because I have multiple game consoles and a dvd player This lets you hook up up to three game consoles or dvd players As long as you buy this from a us store it works I bought it from china once and only one game console port worked But I bought this one from NY and all three ports work I have no complaints now I currently have  game consoles hooked up to it with one dvd player I have  tvs and this lets me play a game and watch tv at the same time so cool I give this product a thumbs upBought this in late  and is still going strong  Works great and has stood up to three kids Solid No issuesworks great Glad i bought this It switched the signal perceftly we have a WII PS and DVD player hooked up to itIve been wanting one of these for a while I would find it so annoying having to unplug my cable to plug in my Xbox wires and then having to do the same again when i felt like watching tv But with this i just have to flip a switch and its doneVery good productworks great for the many systems and players we have and for the price you sure cant beat itThis worked great for my needs my kids are able to have all their games hooked up  Easy to connect and set upsaves so much room everyone need one of these play the ones you want when you want your kids will love itwhat can i say very cheap  works great if u need a simple switcher for rca plugs get thisNo problems  Plugged it into my sons old SD TV that has one AV input and it works just fine  I have threee different connections going in and he does not have any  trouble switching between any of them  Cheap and easy fix to an old TVwhen theres not enough plugs for your consoles this is your solution have seen other ones not as nice as this one that costed way more happy I found itI bought this because my HDTV only had one SVideoAV input The rest were HDMIDVIAudioPCUSB inputs Seeing as though I like to play game consoles such as Dreamcast N  the Wii Ive decided to buy this to hook up such consoles into it The AV selection works nicely You just switch and thats it This device is highly recommendedI purchased these for my Wii as Nintendo no longer produces Wavebird controllers by virtue of them being sued by a patent owner over the technology I didnt want to pay for a used Wavebird on eBay so I bought some of these I sit back from my HDTV about  feet so I needed these for the wired Gamecube controllers and they work very well Even with Mario Kart Wii there is some lag with the Wavebird but there is no lag with these extension cables Highly recommendedCheap and quality product Almost doubled my controller wire so now I can sit far away from the TV Doesnt seem to add any noticible lag or such

Recommended productWorks exactly as advertised Bought these along with a pack of controllers for the GameCube as my TV is a ways away from my couch and i wanted to play multiplayer with my wife The controller plugs into the extension cable about as snugly as the controller and the other end of the extension cable plugs into the GameCube which is to say plenty snug enough to keep it in while moving the controller and cable around semiviolently but not snug enough to keep a controller attached after being thrown across the room just an example One major concern I did have when I bough these was the possibility of lag due to the signal from the controller having to travel farther This concern was unwarranted as I have noticed no difference in response time either way On durability Ive had these for almost  years and they havent shown any noticeable signs of wear Throw in a reasonable price  when I bought it from Amermedia in  and this is a heck of a deal for people that need a product like this I would recommendI bought these to extend the length of the game cube controller reach Everyone that uses these has no issues with poor controller reaction times and can sit just about anywhere to playThis Cable extender worked great I used it when and had absolutely no problems with it at all It adds a good ft of extra cable length I tried hooking two together and I found no extra input lag using these cables

Great if you need the extra cableAnd now I can sit back far enough to see my entire TV and avoid wielders burn in my retina  So simple yet so obvious a necessity given how freaken short the big N made their controllers cords  Buy them now and heal your spineFor people who still have a GameCube but dont have a wireless controller dont bother youll be disappointed because none of them come with the damn adapter these cords are fantastic I can take my controller all over the house with them if I please and they dont cause lag or short out to any degree I can tell Theyre not shoddilymade and have lasted well so far Id buy them againMy nephew wanted an older gamecube game to play in our Wii Once I purchased the game for him we found out that the Wii controllers wont work with the gamecube games when played in the Wii After doing a little research I realized we needed the classic gamecube controller and a gamecube memory card Once we got both of those the gamecube game that we bought finally worked After playing the game for a bit while being tethered to the Wii system because of the cable for the controller we decided we needed extension cables to have a bit more freedom So we got these controller extension cables He is happyThese cords worked great for me and makes my gamecube controllers long enough so I can relax on my couch and play gc at the same time
Also shipped fast I recommend this productThis is a great product that works exactly as the product page states  it extends the reach of the gamecube controller cable by  feet Seems sturdy and the connection is nice and tight so it doesnt fall off by itself Not detecting any latency between hitting the controls and actions happening ingameThese awesomesauce things make any GC controller as far extended as a wavebird Given these days any games I have time to play are all via the Wii anyway having the extra length for GC controllers is greatIt works as advertised
No issues or problems

The product worked as expected
Excellent product
Well doneWith the amount of interference I kept getting with the wireless controllers I was stuck far too close to the TV to enjoy many of the visual aspects of the classics This cable extension cord made playing some of my old Gamecube games just as fun as the day it came out A big must have if you cant get the wireless format to work properlythis really cam in handy we need a extra length for the controller and it was perfect exactly what we neededWhen the gamecube came out we all had   or  inch CRT televisions  The standard  foot gamecube controller cord was acceptable  But now that we have these  inch TV screens  feet just doesnt cut it

Ive used  of these cables for about  months to play games on my gamecube and wii  Everyday I wrap the cords back up around the controller and tuck it away  All that twisting of the cords has had no effect on the connectors  They operate just great  The  pack was enough for me to sit about  feet back from the console and still have slack

Id recommend this to any gamer that uses their gamecube controller on their wii or gamecube and wants to sit back a bit from their TV  Their may be a wireless alternative to a gamecube controller for these older games but I couldnt beat the price  I didnt bother even looking for an alternativeI rated this product as I have because it exceeded my expectations Also I would recommend this product to othersThe gamecube controller wire is length has always been annoying Once got these that solved that problem They work great fit right and do not cause any controller lag Great buyI can now sit on the couch to play instead of putting a chair in front of the TV There are no problemsWith this older non IR system I need to extend the controller with a reasonable item This fit the bill with no problemsThese extenders work as expected I bought them when I wanted to buy Double Dash for the game cube to play on my Wii If youre used to playing the Wii you probably sit much further away than a standard GC controller will reach so definitely pick some of these upAt  feet and at  dollars each its a good deal ive seen some other cables for much more and these work just fine i like that theyre black  and they connect into the controller with ease buy it with confidenceThis isnt a particularly deep product They are wire extenders to be used for the Nintendo Gamecube controllers They come in a pack of two which is fantastic for the cheap price They extend approximately  feet in length and with the already fairly long wire on the Gamecube controller already these come in handy if you need to sit somewhat far away in a regular sized room I have had no trouble with these at all as they function properly and connection just as easily to any controller Getting these beats paying the higher price for the Wavebird wireless Gamecube controllers Im on a budget so Ill just stick with a wired controller no big dealI bought this for my gamecube contoller to plug into my wifes wii It as more than enough to allow comfort and ease of the controllerI play Brawl and Melee all the time with my siblings and friends and sitting squished together  feet from the tv was a pain So I got these cables because it was cheep and could solve most of our problems with this even if it did not look like they would last long from some of the reviews but when i got these they worked great and did not seem cheap at all I expected there to be lag with the controls but there wasnt They have survived a month of intense fighting and are still in topnotch condition These are great if you need room or do not like sitting  feet from the screenI always hated how Gamecube controllers cords were so ridiculously short Since I use them on my Wii now it is much more hazardous for my Wii if someone trips over the short cables This was a perfect solution to my problems So far I havent had any problems with them and they allow me and my friends to not sit  ft away from the Wii Another great thing about these is that you can plug them end on end to make a longer cableTheyre awesome cables though  They work great and add those several feet you always seem to lack  Now I can play my Gamecube games on my Wii from the couch  No batteries to changeI bought  sets of this product so  cables total I was not disappointed They all work perfectly and they accomplished what I bought them for I have  big screen TVs and the  rooms I use for these have couches that sit back a lot further than the standard gamecube controller cord would reach Hook  of these extensions up to each controller and problem solved I also like the length because I still had room to go back farther but this allowed each cord to rest on the ground so there is less of a tripping hazard for those people that never fail to walk in front of everyone and dont pay attention to the cords They even work for Bongos so that is a nice feature to be able to move the bongos back as well for those gamesi bought the  x Wii Gamecube GC Extension Cable Cord  but after a few uses it started working wrong duplicating signals

if i press A in the controller the game detects A being pressed two times this is for all buttons  without the cord the error is no longer thereBought a Gameboy Micro here on Amazon It didnt come with a charging cable So in a pinch I ordered one of these It was to my house within  hours and it works great This product does not work with Gameboy Advance or Advance SP or the Nintendo DSDS LiteDSDS lines This is specfically for the GBMicroCharges the gameboy What a wonderfully futuristic and awesome age we live inI thought it didnt work so I sent it back Bought another and I think Ive learned the problem lies in my GameBoy Micro Looking for a replacement Buy this it works Have had it for about a year or more now and it hasnt let me downThis charger is constructed as well as one would expect for the price I dont abuse my chargers so Im not worried  Retractable prongs are a plus Works well Id buy another if I needed itthe charger is okay and works perfectly it is also the original nintendo one with the logo and everything Seriously its a small adapter that charges a Micro Game boy Yes it charged my Game boy fine and thats all there is to this reviewthey just dont make any chargers for this and are hard to find so this is just a life saver for meIts a charger Not name brand But it worked Would buy again if I needed to Need four more wordsI bought an old game boy micro off the internet and ordered this charger separate I worried it would not work but it fully charged the unit within an hour Great productI still remember when I first bought this game back in   It was when I first got my PS and I wasnt disappointed
The graphics were pretty crisp and clear and it had a nice little selection of playable characters including Spiderman Iron Man The Hulk Psylocke Wolverine and others  For those who played Marvel vs Capcom  before this one the movement may feel a little slow to you  However this was the first of the Marvel vs Capcom style games so dont expect it to be as good as MVC
The default controls for this game are the easiest to work with of any of the Marvel titles  Youll find it easy to learn and it fits the PS controller perfectly  Air combos can be pulled off easily but it may take a while for some to learn how to do them
On this game youll find that the characters hyper combos are much more powerful than they are on MVC  However since this was the first of these type of fighter games the characters have less moves to execute  The thing that really separates this game from all of the others is the Gems  There are  Gems that you may use during battle and different ones have different effects on certain characters  For example when Juggernaut uses the space gem he turns silver and gains super armor  When Psylocke uses the Power gems she creates  copies of herself so then its like fighting  of them at once  The final boss on this game is Thanos  Hes better than the boss on the other Marvel titles because hes actually a challenge  He automatically starts the match with all  gems and he also has  different hyper combos he can do with each gem  Also this game actually has endings for the characters and the music is superior to all of the other titles except for Marvel vs Street Fighter
I recommend you buy this game if you can find it for a reasonable price  You wont be disappointed  It may seem outdated for those who played MVC before playing this but its still enjoyableForsaken  is one of those games that you never heard of and play it anyways and you find it to be an awesome game The singleplayer is intense and the multiplayer is crazier than that The game itself has sixdegrees of freedom so you can shoot upsidedown sideways etc The singleplayer has tons of missions and you will not get through it in one setting I never actually figured out how to save the game but I will figure it out eventually The multiplayer you can either play with bots or with your friends The game supports player multiplayer even thought sadly Ive only played it with only one other person The multiplayer game is like a deadlier version of hide and seek because the maps are so big One thing I like about playing it with bots is being able to play it splitscreen so its like there are  other people in the room with you Overall the game is great and is a definite buy for every N fanGame works great amazing story that brings back childhood memories i love it Awesome game to have that is old schoolLooking anywhere else people will charge more than  for an old wonderful game like this Classic games like these are hard to come by wish I had traded in LESS of my games when I was youngMegaman legends is capcoms answer to bringing Megaman into the d realm on the original playstation However this game is extremly diffrent then any other megaman game out there In fact it has a lot in common with zelda ocarina of time and a few rpg elements such as final fantasy while still somewhat feeling like a Megaman game Coming from the NES and SNES Megamans I never thought I would ever compare zelda and megaman together but surprisingly it works well Its not the greatest  game or even the greatest megaman game ever but it is really fun in its own way

Most people do not like the graphics in this game but i think there done really well The only problem graghicly is due to the early psx hardware most d games looked blocky and pixely at the time and this on tries to smooth things out kinda cel shadish but not quite this leads to some blockeness but its still better then most  and before graphics Kinda a d playable anime style to it The sound isnt to bad in this game Voice acting can be really good or painfully bad andThe music is catchy maybe not as much as the nes megamans but still good However there is moments without any music Technically speaking I would say the game has aged well

The thing I find most memorable about this game is the gameplay Like I mentioned earlier this game takes megaman into zelda like enviorments with a few rpgs elements There is a open world which was decent in size for its time which the game takes place in a small town There are dungeons to explore which you do so in order to find upgrades to your equipment Speaking of which you can purchase and find diffrent armor and weopens with diffrent specs attack fire rate etc in a rpg like menu With that being said it still manages to feel like a megaman game There is plenty of missions of which you are running and gunning while jumping on platforms The bosses while set up like zelda can be taken down easier by weopens you find around in dungeons

As for the story it isnt to bad It is a little childish but its still pretty good The characters while the voice acting can be off at times can be good are very memorable Tron Bonne makes her debut here as a villian who became popular enough to get her own game misadventures of tron bonne and a apperance in marvel vs capcom  and appearing without megaman in the rd There is also a N port of this game which isnt as good but if you dont have a psx its still playable plus a sequel Anyway while the hardcore bit megaman players may be turned off by this i would still recomend getting this gameI remember playing this when I was  The story was great and I played it through more times than I can rememberI am very satisfied with the product it came in a good time and the customer service provided was greatLegends is one of the rare Megaman releases that takes place in a D world as opposed to the traditional D side scroller most MM fans are familiar with Both Legends and Legends  are among some of the best made story driven D adventure games the PSX has in its massive and sometimes daunting libraryThis was my first action RPG and its the best basically if your an older player like me  may not hold up  graphically today but it is a very fun and expansive game for its timeI already own this game but its in terrible condition This is due to me lending it out which is something I certainly dont do anymore My favorite Megaman game period along with  I had to get it again And I have no regrets Besides I have  copies of the game now One with only case and disc that have seen their better days and a newer complete copy that reminds me of my original copy in its primeMegaman Legends
This is my undisputed favorite game of all time I bought it in  or so because I had played and lovednbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefMegaMandpBSVSrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTFMega Man anbspfor thenbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefNintendoNESSystemVideoGameConsoledpBSVYQrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTFNintendo NES System  Video Game Consoleanbspwhen I was young This game was nothing like that game or any other Megaman games It was in D and had a story that would blow your mind I have played through this game around  times and no every single part of it by heart

Graphics 
The transition to D for Megaman isnt an ugly one but a decent one Most of the trees have a D look to them and a lot of characters are blocky Still you can tell what everything is easily and there is no slowdown at all Not to mention there is hardly any load time to wait through in this game

Story 
You are Megaman Volnutt Roll Casket and her Grandpa Barrel Casket have raised you since they found you when you were a child Following Barrels footsteps Megaman and Roll become Diggers Diggers are people who search through ruins infested with Reaverbots to find parts and other things The main thing a lot of Diggers are looking for are Refractors which are extremely powerful crystallike objects that power society The world is almost entirely ocean so people must use flying machines or boats to get around Megaman Roll and Barrel crashland their flying ship The Flutter on an island called Kattelox You go on to discover the islands many secrets and fight off the treasure hungry pirates

Sound 
The music and sound effects in this game are decent Nothing will blow your mind away but nothing will annoy you to death Some tunes even become catchy like the Apple Market tune

Gameplay 
You play as Megaman exploring ruins fighting pirates and just helping people out There are a lot of side quests you can do You can join a secret gang fill a museum with underground arts help a little girl recover play in game shows and so much more The main storyline has you exploring the SubGate ruins in hopes to learn more about the Islands great treasure or disaster While in SubGates you can find all kinds of items to do things with Its not just in the SubGates either you can search in other digging sites for parts You have a primary weapon called a Buster Gun which can be upgraded with  buster parts initially These buster parts can be bought or found and change different aspects of your Buster Guns shooting You have a secondary special weapon that can be equipped and upgraded as well You will get many different special weapons in the game and one of the most fun parts of the game is upgraded your weapons to perfect ability

Difficulty  Note This is how much I like the difficulty
Since this game is more story based the difficulty is slight There is hardly a time where you feel that you are going to die minus a few bosses Once you beat the original game you can go back and play it on a new Hard Mode option The game is still not that much more difficult but some of the bosses will give you more trouble Also to top it off the game isnt that long Even the player who likes to talk to every single person and gets lost often can still beat this game in less then  hours That includes the main storyline and all side quests minus special weapon upgrading I can now beat the game on Hard Mode in around  hours

Overall 
Despite the game being easy and not having the best graphics or sound its still  stars The games storyline and gameplay is so good that the rest doesnt even matter Youll still find yourself going back and playing this game over and over againIf you find Street Fighter Alpha  overwhelming then you should try Street Fighter Alpha    characters containing some of the most popular characters from the series Ryu Ken Dan ChunLi has her Kikoken fireball but not her Spinning Bird Kick Akuma Sakura Zangief Dhalsim Sagat and heplaysjustlikeGuile Charlie  Each character has hisher own ending
You dont need to worry about what strength to use when using super combos because each one takes only one power bar  Great soundtrack if you played Puzzle Fighter then some of the music should be familiar to you  Graphics are great taunts are outstanding and game control is excellent  If you have a chance grab this classicThis is an excellent game for spending some time on I have played it before on a demo cd long ago so thats why I decided to buy it Its about passing missions and destroying planes bases ships etc It find it very fun The missions happen in different ambiences and time of the day which makes it more interesting You can get new planes with different attributes according to what you want A great title for the psThere seems to be a curse on Ace Combat akin to that on the Star Trek movies And by that I mean that the odd numbered members of the series are forgettable while the even numbered save perhaps zero but zero is the absence of value right are stellar Ace Combat  Awesome Ace Combat  Uneven and over too quick Ace Combat  Perfect Ace Combat  Had half the missions removed for the US release Ace Combat  Air Combat Stone Age And Ace Combat 

If youre into classic gaming and love the Playstation and especially if you love air combat games this is a definite buy The sheer imagination that was put into this game is wonderful You have night missions sea missions desert missions highaltitude missions ravine missions and ohsowonderful cityliberation mission

Ive said it before and Ill say it again theres more to graphics than just how many polygons you have and how detailed your textures are Graphics even lowres graphics can and should be BEAUTIFUL And beautiful this game is in all its Playstation polygon glory The lighting the jets the far off cityscapes and the clouds in the sky its all just beautiful to me at least And better yet unlike other air combat games of the era everything moves at a rocketing speed Even when you get close to the ground where other games look like youre moving in slow motion the game keeps a great sensation of speed

The controls are uniformly tight utilizing the analog controls to the full And you can bank and pitch completely upside down something that many similar arcadestyle games of the time dont allow The game also features a wonderful cockpit view that brings you into the experience even more Theres also voice chatter as you go some nice arcade style music and full voice command briefings nice Of course you also hear Bingo every time you hit a target and get a comment every time you miss too but thats just keeping with the arcade feel The enemy AI might not be as good as you can get now but its definitely good for when this game came out and you can still get shot down if you play on hard and dont watch yourself

In my opinion this game was the first great console air combat game If you love arcade style air combat games and play Playstation games you just have to get this gameThis game is a classic I first played it at the arcade around  but the game came out around  Of course you wont find beautiful visuals this is piece of history one of the first D fighting games ever created It was groundbreaking for its time and to this day I still find it addictive
Each character has a unique fighting style and these styles keep getting inherited on every sequel most noticeable Paul Jack Yoshimitsu and Law The Playstation version actually expands the arcade version adding ending movies and extra characters There is an arcade version in Tekken  as part of the bonus arcade history games Tekken  and  are also included
If you enjoyed games like Rival Schools Mortal Kombat  or Dead or Alive you definately need to play thisEver since I was young I have been in love with the Tekken series Brings back a lot of good memories I bought this game to bring back the memories and the fun Though the graphics arent as top notch at games these days are but its still an entertaining game to play If you collect either Tekken stuff or video games this is a must ownNever actually owned the original Tekken but I played it Since Im the best Tekken player in the universe Ive decided that I want to own the game that started it allI have been playing car racing games since their early beginning on PC I currently have a logitech G force feedback wheel to play with
I have played most of the Colin Mc Rae Need for speed Grid and Dirt games before I also tried my hands at more simulation oriented games like GTR GTR GP Legends
Dirt came in as a nice and pleasant surprise Dirt tops it off

As I am sure many will detail everything about this game I will limit myself to the most important points for me

Pros
 Amazing graphics
 Amazing physics
 Challenging but entertaining races

Cons
 Gymkhana
 Interface

What went through the conceptors mind about gymkhana Racing is not easy for most but gymkhana is really a pain in the neck
I saw the videos of Ken Block on Youtube and indeed he is really impressive Am I even dreaming of doing the same No
Racing require good racing skills to start but Gymkhana requires a perfect control of the vehicles and most of us will never achieve such level So I find the attemps slightly pointless and extremely frustrating

Now what about the interface Simply put it does not remotely compare with Dirts interface It is messy I had to search online to figure out where to find my best times There are not enough info about the cars the races the sponsors It leaves a lot to desire A complete miss

Conclusion
As far as rallye racing This game is the best out there today
If you are one who needs crazy challenges try the gymkhana and good luck
In spite of my criticism I definitely do not regreat this purchaseTHIS GAME WAS GREAT THOUGH IT DOESNT COMPARE TO ITS ORIGINAL ARCADE MACHINE THIS HOME VERSION IS NICE ANYWAY THE FIGHTS ARE ALL FUN THE GRAPHICS STILL LOOK FANTASTIC EVEN THOUGH THIS GAME IS NEARLY A DECADE OLD NOW AND THE CHARACTERS ARE ALL GOOD AND THE STORYLINES ARE ALL INTERESTING TO UNLOCK THE BOSSES WHICH IS THE MAIN THING YOU HAVE TO BEAT THEM ALL WITH THEIR ALREADY AVAILABLE COUNTERPARTS THE FIRST TIME YOU BEAT HEIHACHI WHICH IS THE MAIN BOSS FOR THIS GAME YOU GET HIM UNLOCKED BUT THE REST OF THEM YOU HAVE TO PLAY AS THE COUNTERPARTS TO GET THEIR BOSSES EVEN WITH THE PLAYSTATION  AND X BOX AND STATE OF THE ART SYSTEMS LIKE THAT ON THE MARKET MANY OF THE GAMES THEY PUT OUT TODAY CANT COMPARE TO CLASSIC GAMES LIKE THIS THIS IS ONE OF THE ALLTIME GREATEST FIGHTING GAMES EVER AND I DARE SAY THIS MIGHT BE THE BEST OF THE TEKKEN SERIES EVEN HAS GREAT MUSICBreath of Fire IIIs oldschool graphics capture the feel of old RPGs and how good they were playing on NES and Super NES back in the old days Now  I still play SNES playing such good games as Super Godzilla Breath of  Fire I and the Final Fantasy series The storyline goes as followsRyu is  a survivor of an ancient race of dragons the Brood which nearly destroyed  the world However he is a good dragon He allies himself with Yraall  Region thieves Rei and fellow dragon Teepo who at the time doesnt know  hes a dragon He aligns himself with the young Princess of Wyndia  Princess Nina and the daughter of a smart scientist Momo a mutated  vegetable named Peco who has a lot of significance at the end of the game  and a Guardian of Urkan Tapa whos race once fought and defeated the  dragons in a war Garr Together they quest to find Ryus origin and other  members of his race and to find out if Ryu is evil or not With beautiful  music surroundings and a great storyline this is one of the best RPGs of  allwith many minigames abound and a fantastic battle system Definitely  get this if youre a fan of Capcom RPGscapcom is the greatest video game company in the universe there true geniuss the best of the best capcom rocks all the games that capcom made from the s to  are the greatest video games in the universe there true classics the best of the best all the games that capcom made from the s to  rocks breath of fire  is the greatest video game company in the universe a true classic the best of the best breath of fire  rocksbreath of fire  is the greatest video game in the universe a true classic the best of the best breath of fire  rockshavent play for long time and love this game as enjoy play it good play game I guess well alrightLove the game thanks
This game is great from the look and the level of detail and the combat Thanksive been wanting this game for forever the story line battle modes and game play are amazing for me it is almost like pokemon and final fantasy mixed together as far as the graphics go just a great game great music and character designsThis game is one of my all time favorites I give it a  in the RPG genre  It is a turn based RPG that is fun to play  I own this game for the PSP and the now the PS  This game is a rare find in good condition  If you find a better RPG than this besides the final fantasy games of course let me knowthis game is alot of fun you can somewhat customize your characters and tinker with thier stats and magicskills the game is pretty long for  disk game but it also had a couple puzzles that makes you want to throw your remote at the tv lol all in all its all worth the hassleBreath of Fire III is one of those games that can induce a trance of nostalgia upon thought  I can say this about few games because most are powered by processors that reflect obsession with graphics and innovation  Innovation is necessary and appreciated but games like BOF need never disappear  It caters to the oldtime gamer in all RPG veterens delivering a simplistic save the world storyline and involving gameplay  And what gameplay  Its simplicity and charm will hopefully impress those who give it a chance because it is very deserving of credit  Last I must mention the fishing system  Its incredibly addictive simple and enjoyable  Nothing else could more easily describe it  Throw in about another hundred fish and a wider variety of rods and bait and youd have a full game that I would have to own  Its that good  For everyone whether an RPGnewbie or a hardcore veteren you should give this game a chance  Fun doesnt begin to describe itMany may disregard the Breath of Fire series as just another RPG but Capcom has done a beutiful Job with this title  They pulled out a lot on this case  Beutiful D graphics that only Capcom can do good music simple controls make this an excellent purchase  Chances are you may find this at a good price somewhere so I say go for itBreath of Fire  is a very interesting and well made game  The plot is pretty good and the characters are interesting and memorable  One thing I do miss from the older Breath of Fire is the way they transformed into dragons the process in the current game is excellent I just prefer the older methods  My favorite part of the game is that you start off playing a young version of the character and then later in the game you get to play a more mature version of the same character  This game is a lot of fun and suitable for most people who enjoy the genreTekken  it the huge sequel to the best selling fighter Tekken this game includes advanced fighting and secret characters to die for Not only theat but it had a plethera of gameshark codes to make the game easier this game also introduced the  hit combo the automatic win Namco has done it again and they have done it with flying colors this game is a must have for the fighting fansThis is my familys favorite fighting game From my six year old daughter on up to my yr old son they love this game  The graphics along with the sounds and moves are excellent also there is a great character selection to choose fromThis is one of the best fighting games of all time Definitely a timeless classic   and  are by far the best in the seriesThis was the very nd one I playedpart  as the st Its nice seeing the younger versions of the characters and the events leading up to Tekken  YesSEVEN IS YET TO ARRIVE as of this review AnywayEasy mode is still hard by the time you reach the th fighter The music is awesome especially Kings You can set the music to Arranged or Arcade A great set of moves to learn so hop to it and buy itwhat is there to say this game has everything you want in a fighting game plenty of characters to choose from and the gameplay is top notch for a ps game definitely one of my favoritesI remember Tekken  being one of my first fighting games I have ever played and one that I kept coming back to It wasnt just the nostalgia that kept me coming back but the overall gameplay as well Almost everything about this game was done right and there is very little to complain about

Tekken  takes place  years after the events of the first Tekken The plot isnt very well developed and isnt really involving but everything else more than makes up for it The graphics for the time were amazing and the animations were also nicely done The roster includes  characters who are all unique and feel very well balanced The game is very accessible and almost anyone can pick up this game and get a pretty decent grasp on it The controls are simple and intuitive and I always believed that this control scheme each button controls a limbex left punch right punch is one of the best for fighting games

For modes you have your basic arcade mode which you complete to unlock new characters You also have a vs mode a team battle mode which is very enjoyable a survival mode a time attack mode and a practice mode All of these modes offer allot of replayability as it is easy to dump countless hours into any of these modes

The combat system is still excellent to this day The amount of combos that each character can do is pretty substantial and you will discover new moves without being too overwhelmed There also arent really any cheap tactics unlike some of the more recent iterations of tekken such as excessive juggling

Overall this game is one of the best fighting games that I have ever played With plenty of characters to learn plenty of modes to choose from amazing looking backgrounds and a terriffic combat system there is no reason to skip this game If you still have a psps BUY THIS GAME I recommend this game wholeheartedly and you wont regret it at allThank youWonderfuland Trusting product and seller Recommend Word Word word word word word so many words required almost doneand doneThough this review may be  years  laten my opinion TK is the best of the PS Tekken games From the cool fmv intro  the ending credits TK is by far the best lookingsounding D fighting game on the ps console TK backgroundsmusicfmv cinemaslight source shadinganimationscombos just doesnt measure  the standards set by this  classic and it was release  years latergo figureThe sequel to the very popular Tekken Tekken  takes everything that the original had and expands upon it More characters more levels more moves Tekken  is a classic and should be in the library of any fighting game lover

The combat in Tekken is one of best ever There are so many possible combinations its almost impossible to remember them all Each Tekken gets better and better Another thing I love about this game is the music It suits the stages and characters wellEver since I was young I have been in love with the Tekken series Brings back a lot of good memories I bought this game to bring back the memories and the fun Though the graphics arent as top notch at games these days are but its still an entertaining game to play If you collect either Tekken stuff or video games this is a must own This sequal is too good to miss out on Buy it before its gone for goodSame goes for Tekken  played but never owned Now that Im officially the best Tekken player period the urge to own all of them even the first  just consumed meWell I just recently bought this game again after finding it broken from unkown causes quite a few years ago People keep on saying Tekken  has HORRIBLE graphics and the gameplay is horrible To those people did you ever think that this game came out during the s and was probably awesome graphics back then If youre a fan of good fighting games I reccomend this It has lots of characters fair graphics and is a good collectible for your Tekken collectionTHIS GAME WAS A VERY GOOD GAME BUT THIS AINT AS GOOD AS TEKKEN  LIKE ITS PREDECESSOR HAS GREAT GRAPHICS GREAT LOOKING MOVES AND GREAT BOSSES TO UNLOCK WHICH GIVES YOU A REASON TO WANNA WIN THE GAME WITH EVERY CHARACTER THE MUSIC IS GREAT HERE TOO THIS IS A DEFINITE GEM GET THIS AND ITS PREDECESSOR FOR THE ULTIMATE GAMING EXPERIENCEFrom the cool first cutcene to the classic music that plays while picking a character you know this is special

goku who you could suuuuper juuump and throoow fire balls fire balls bring out your second character fire powerFrom all the fighting video games around Street Fighter has always been the mother of all From its beginning it has been a game who deserves admiration and if it did good as a D game it did way better as DThis game gives us the opportunity to enjoy SF even more with a lot new things such as great graphiccombos that will blow your mindlots of new options and lots of characters to chose from It brings us a whole new SF with the same stuffs we like Old characters in their D version which is just perfect and a whole new cast all with their uniques techniques This game has new options never seen before in any other SF game The arcadeversusTeamectmodes are all new and better This game offers you a great deal of exitement as you spend more time playing it By farone of the most revolutionary and why not controversial among fans from all the SF games Buy itplay it for  or  hours and I guarantee you this game got nothing to envy other SF gamesIve had Tomb raider since July and this game is off the meters When I first played it I was frustrated with the controls but once u learn them this game is the best The worlds are long and puzzling but its never too hard to finish The action and suspense make u feel like its a movie I reccomend this to anybody who likes action or  fans like me You WILL love it trust meThis is the best game I have yet to play  It took me six months to finally defeatfigure out and fight my way to the end of this game  This game was like a very suspenseful movie that I was controlling Many times in the game I was actually sweating from fear You dont know whats waiting for you around each corner waiting to jump out at you and scare the crap out of you Even my family and onlookers were startled or to afraid to play this game because of the  realism captured in enormous worlds and creepy CD soundsThis game realeased in  I think was the first in the Klonoa series which includles a few more games in Japan and was defenently a sleepermasterpeice for PSone This game however feels a little bit different than the other games in this series though Im not excatly sure why I think the main reasons it feels so different are the graphics the story line the music and the character differnces Graphicaly wise you can tell its older but the graphics have a certain charm to them The few outofengine motion scenes though are magnificent However the graphic style is drasticaly different from its sequels The plot is overall a little more classic fantasyish and feels kinda like something you might read in a book which is probably what they were aiming at since it has a book theme It has a bit of a melancholy feel to it which makes it feel slightly more intense than its sequals Actually I think its the best story of any of the Klonoa games As for the ending I loved it Sad and moving without being overly sad I think its my favorite vidoe game ending The BGM is a different style than Lunateas Veil also Its PS sequal less solemn and RPG like and a little more lively or something not really sure what the word is it fits the game well What I mean by character differneces is that it has no familiar characters other than Klonoa and Huepow Klonoa however is quite different than in his sequels Dispite these differences the gameplay is practicaly clonecopy of the others in the series esspecial Lunateas Veil From what I have heard many people that played this were dissapointed with the sequel I think that it was probably because they were used to this style and didnt give it much of a chance personaly I was dissapointed with THIS game at first then started to really like it after I got used to it Anyway bottom line is that if youve played all the other Klonoa games expect this one to be a little different but defenently get it if you enjoyed the others youll enjoy this If you havent played any of the other games in this great series its based on engaging gameplay with simplistic controls This game is one of the few D games in existance It plays parellel to a D game people still hanging onto their old copies of Sonic the Hedgehog  or Mario Bros should try this In this game however you are in a D environment dont worry the paths are clearly defined you wont have any trouble figuring out where you can and cant go You can interact with the background by throwing things into it this is esspecially key in some bosses This is the D part There are  levels not counting the final bossin this game plus an unlockable time attack level This game is pretty easy and if your looking for an extreamly hard nail biting challenge this probably isnt for you This is more of a fun relaxing game However I love this game and recommend it to all who own a PlaystationThis is the best Tomb Raider along with the nd one Graphics are actually still all right now  years later Buy this on here or on psn its a wonderful game from a simpler time Reminds me of my youth when we didnt have video walkthroughsThis is an amazing oringal game that I purely enjoyed playing The storyline is so original for its time and its graphics are amazing on wide screen tvs In the game you are Lara Croft a tomb raider and have been given another opportunity to explore more for artifacts in Peru by Jacalene Natla a millionaire investor who holds a dark secret You soon realize she is not what she claims and you do undercover research and she betrays you You travel thru the dark cold and abandoned caves of peru ancient underground Greece the catacombs of Egypt  Atlantis all to find  pieces of the scion for which Natla asked her to get all while blasting out animals and creatures you wouldnt expect and collect secrets along the way This is a great game that had a greater sequal But this is my favorite out of the series Original playstion graphics great music and sound affects and great storylineThe box its in perfect condition and the books are awesome with great details just a must have for every Zelda collectorDespite awkward controls that seem to be designed more for a computer than a Game System and get used to it because that lasts until the PS era aka the sixth game in the series this has to be one of the funnest games of all time It gives a challenge on multiple levels  inspires you to keep playing to find out what happens next as things get progressively more dangerous and more bizarre Was remade as Tomb Raider Anniversary but Id prefer the original any dayTomb Raider was one of the first games I completed and it was tough Really challenging throughout and educational one of the most intriguing and fun games to pass while shooting at random things and at Dinosaurs and Bears and other animals really greatIf you are a fan of TR youre gonna love to have this one in your collection The graphics are better though on the pc versionThis game is a winner and a true classic

This game redefined the role playing wheel when it was released on PS It was a smash hit and has since spawned many sequels to the original game

The graphics are a nice step  forward from earlier RPG platforms including NES SNES Sega etc

The controls are challenging and to someone who doesnt want to take the time getting used to it impossible However when you buy an RPG you want a challenge and Tomb Raider delivers that on all levels As far as game control goes it will definitely take some patience to learn the many skills Lara can do She can do a variety of things like different jumps flips crawling fighting moves etc If you have no patience this game will drive you crazy It really is a shame that some people tear down this game when they have no idea what they are talking about Who wants to play an RPG with no challenge not me This game takes time to learn how to master the acrobatic moves fighting moves jumps etc I like that and if challenge is what you want this delivers Once you learn how the controls operate you realize it is quite easy to use

The graphics are really well done and definitely an improvement over older platforms too The characters and scenery are much sharper in higher definition for then previous platforms and more with more colors One of my favorite characters is the huge TRex you must fight It looks like a TRex too The graphics are just awesome I love how the blood flies when you kill an animal Previous platforms didnt really do that and  in such detail

Another thing that made it better over older platforms is the continued ability to move freely about the landscape unrestricted but with even more vantage points You can view yourself from pretty much any angle Top bottom sides any angle at any given moment You can watch yourself from the side then go to top view bottom view etc etc Its just awesome the advances over previous RPG platforms

The music in this game is very well done and of CD sound quality The music is crystal clear and fits the game perfectly The background music is often very hauntingly eerie Also the sound effects are of nice CD sound quality too

This game has many many hours of game play that will keep you busy for awhile Lots of different scenery in different places of the world You find yourself in a variety of places and not just dungeons and caves but there is plenty of that as well

If getting through the many challenging levels and trying to stay alive isnt enough for you there are many many hidden secrets for you too find also Some are easy to find some are pretty challenging to find

If you love exploring caves catacombs dungeons and having to constantly fight then you will love this game Lots of challenges puzzles and lots of ways to die too The game requires patience and if you are a true RPG fan this game is a must have

Highly recommend  starsI absolutely love Tomb Raider It is definitely my favorite game of all time It has everything you need to make a wonderfully fun game There is action and adventure thriller problem solving and an entertaining story line I love the challenge of the problem solving It isnt a game you can finish in a couple hours but take a long time to get through all of the different puzzles You definitely get your moneys worth with play time on this game It will always keep you thinking I couldnt ask for a better gameThis takes back memories when I first played Tomb Raider  Its both chalenging and fun  Its remake is just added stuff and newly improved stagesAmazing value I cannot believe this set is available for this price Everything from the packaging to the quality of the paper is stellar  This set feels like it was put together with care in mind Also worth noting is the fact that the Ocarina of Time guide can only be found in this set Only criticism I have is that the cloth maps were not included for  Twilight Princess and Wind Waker Still Im very happy with my purchaseI had to go back and play this game after playing and loving Tomb Raider Anniversary Playing Anniversary and then going back to the original really makes you appreciate just how awesome this game was The level design was just amazing with all the different areas you get to explore I havent played the original since it first came out so I didnt realize just how much Crystal Dynamics took from this game They took a lot Some of the level designs are almost identical The biggest difference between the old and the new is the difficulty Anniversary is way easier But not because the puzzles or enemies are easier Its because of the controls Back in Tomb Raider  the controls were pretty terrible But what do you expect from a game breaking new ground in the world of D So Ill over look it and give it a  out of OH YESthis game is what its all about  Sure it looks totally archaic now with its primitive lowpolygon D cf Laras Madonnastyle pyramid breasts and jerky low frame rate  BUT WHO CARES  Tomb Raider was one of the first fullyrealized D games with huge environments and a camera that lets you explore them fully  something nextgen developers still seem to have a problem with sometimes  and of course best of all an action hero that players across the board could instantly connect with  Yes Lara Croft  men want her women want to be herlol  Forget about her later misadventures on celluloid and worst of all the PS platform  Even on the PS all the new innovations in graphics and AI that cropped up in subsequent TR installments couldnt improve upon the originality of gameplay you have here in the debut  The puzzles the secrets the attimes relentless action this game has it all

Much like Indiana Jones we first encounter Lara as she explores some ruins in South America  allegedly the village of Vilcabamba an actual archeological site in Ecuador although as it appears in the game its more of a generic hotchpot of preColumbian art and architecture  Of course you have the rolling ball traps everywhere and of course she eventually finds a golden idol  more nods to Indy  Later she explores Las Vegas versions of Rome and Egypt slaughtering more endangered species in the process than are even left on the planet PETA just loved this game before proceeding to  where else  Atlantis which is naturally swarming with freakish and bloodthirsty mutants  All this because shes in search of an artifact whose magical powers if in the wrong hands could destroy the world or something

Its easy to punch holes in the ridiculous plot but that doesnt affect the entertainment value  again just like with Indy you know its stupid but youre more than willing to suspend disbelief just to go along with the wild ride  Getting through the levels is not always easy youll need to sharpen both your combat and puzzlesolving skills  Theres also a lot of replay value owing to the oftentimes diabolicallyhidden secrets which usually contain caches of weapons and the infamous medipaks

Play this game  its almost like a cool retro thing to do now  and forget about everything that came after  They have a new TR in the works now but its got a lot of bad karma to overcomeso far nothing has matched this original masterpieceOk sounds perveted It may be weird to have a crush on the sexy adventurous and alluring Lara Croft but many other people do too
Anyway this is it The first Tomb Raider game It has classic written all over it Despite being dated and encountering countless predecessors sequels and dissapointing movies the game manages to have to a strong following and is considered to best game of them all
It was orginal back then where archaeologist Lara Croft a female Indiana Jones is called upon to use her intelligence amazing physical skills and her big guns to solve complexed and ancient puzzles battle hard enemies and travel the whole world in style I forget the storyline since I havent played this game in ages but its good You should ask my mom who played and beat every Tomb Raider gameSorry mom Im not kidding She did The graphics are surprisingly good to look at as well as the hard puzzles to solvewhich made it famous to play and the fun movie scenes Check out the dinosaur too in this game its a blast
Anyway a highly reccomended game But I liked Tomb Raider  way better then this oneIf I could have give  stars for this game I would have  I played this originally when it first came out in   Back then games such as Resident Evil and Tomb Raider were groundbreaking milestones in entertainment known as video games  I wont talk about Resident Evil here because everyone knows about that
Tomb Raider was the first game to give players control of a character in a true D environment  Sure you had games like Doom and Wolfenstien but they played only on a single plane with your character spinning on an axis  Tomb Raider allowed you to control Lara the feminine version of Indiana Jones an use the environments such as cliffs roofs etc to progress through the levels  Level design in Tomb Raider is really what the game is centered around  Beautiful stunning breathtaking eerie surreal all describe the level design here  Nothing short of ingenious
The game mechanics and control of Lara were never the best but they were also adequate to get the job done  Lara spins on a fixed axis when the player turns left and right and forward makes her run in the direction she is facing  Turning can sometimes be a chore especially when the action is turned up a notch  Luckily the circle button makes Lara do a somersault tumble for a quick aboutface  The shimmying and climbing from ledge to ledge and jumping has always been amazing  Combine that with sliding down angular rock formations and time jumps and grabs to ledges and you are bound to fall in love with the action that Eidos developed NOTE This kind of mechanics shined most for me in this game as opposed to all the predecessors including Angel of Darkness for PS  This kind of action became less and less as the series went on save for Last Revelation maybe  The swimming sequences and puzzles are also a really wonderful treat as well
There are plenty of surprises in this game that I dont want to give away however I will tell you that some of the levels in the game will stick in your memory for a long long time after  For example The God Room of St Francis Folly has got to be one of the best and most memorable and beautiful levels of any game that Ive played
So why am I writing this review now  years after the release date  For a few reasons  First being that I cant get the game out of my head for more than a few months  Every six months I go back to it  The second reason is that when I bought a PS I knew I would be playing the original Tomb Raider again and wanted that backward capability  And THIRD and quite possibly the most important and the reason I titled this review Dear Eidos is that Angel of Darkness was the single reason that I sold my PS for an XBox  At first I enjoyed AOD but the game has rampant problems  Ive always welcomed a new Tomb Raider game in my life and gave AOD more than one chance  I loved all the other PS Tomb Raider games including III which got a lot of harsh and unwarranted criticisms in my mind but whatever  I hated AOD and want Eidos to know that  And FOURTH reason is that I repurchased the new and compact PSOne last week  I still own my Tomb Raider from back in the day  Last night I played it and the magic was back like from the first time I played it  Sure the graphics feel older but they are by no means bad at all considering that I play games like Halo Crimson Skies Prince of Persia and Rainbow Six  on the XBox  There will always be a large place in my geeky videogaming heart for this true classic
EIDOS TAKE THE POWER BACKSo this is where it all began  the original Tomb Raider In November  Britain was changing With the phenomenal success of the Spice Girls and the phrase girl power there wasnt a better time to bring out an allfemale computer game heroine who kicked rear Enter Lara Croft The game went straight to No  all over the world and shifted more than  million copies to become THE biggest selling PlayStation game of all time Lara soon became a cultural icon gracing hundreds of magazine covers the world over  and not just computer magazines mainstream magazines such as Rolling Stone and Time undoubtedly the biggest magazine names in the world Four sequels followed in the form of Tomb Raider II Tomb Raider III Tomb Raider IV The Last Revelation and Tomb Raider IV Chronicles The five games have sold a combined total of  million worldwide and secured Eidos Interactive and more importantly Lara Croft and Tomb Raider a place in video gaming history as undoubtedly the greatest most popular and enjoyable computer games of all time
The story of Tomb Raider is simple really Lara Croft is a semifamous archeologist adventurer and has been hired by a mysterious woman Natla last name unknown to search the globe for an ancient artifact known as the Scion that is beleived to have come from the lost city of Atlantis Lara sets off on her travels to find this artifact but before she can find it she must search other areas of the world to find clues and hints that will open the way forward to her ultimate prize Around halfway through the game while uncovering clues about the artifact in question Lara also unveils the truth about Natla a story told through amazing cutscenes The storyline is intriguing to say the least and keeps you on the very edge of your seat as you beg to know more yet never for the game to end
The game begins with simple pedestrian levels for newcomers to get to grips with the controls The enemies are only small in the first few levels bats dogs etc that can be eliminated with a single shot of Laras Pistols  a weapon that she has with her always that features an unlimited amount of ammo The game has a massive  levels that will keep you playing for months  it took me  months to complete In fact I finished the week Tomb Raider II came out so once Id finished with the first I spent the next  months playing the second one This has been a regular oocurance and has resulted in me playing all five Tomb Raider games for around  years without a break I remember the days when I bought this gameI was only  and it scared me to death The enemies may not look very real but remember that controlling Lara is You control her every move so her life is in your hands At the time the game was released the graphics were unbelievable and the scenery breathtaking The former is not so much now but the latter still stands Graphics in computer games have come a very long way since  but half an hours play on Tomb Raider with Ms Croft and its superior excellence shines through The final levels are set in and around Atlantis and are classic moments in video gaming history From the rocky cliffs of Asia to the hot muggy forests of South America and the haunting and eerie lost island of Atlantis theres something here for everyone Buy it now
OVERALL GRADE 
All in all Tomb Raider is the ultimate PlayStation game Everything about this game is so enchanting and memorable The atmosphere the sounds the animals make the noises Lara makes when falling off a rock the music that cues to tell you something exciting is about to happen  everything This is a true classic in video gaming history that deserves all the critical praise it recieved  years ago If you havent got Tomb Raider in your PlayStation games collection it is not complete Only when you purchase all  Tomb Raider games will your collection be complete With the soontobe released Lara Croft Timb Raider VI The Angel Of Darkness all six Tomb Raider will keep me playing for decades literally I will still be playing Tomb Raider when Im  years old and Im sure Ill not be the only oneIts great to play if you have nothing to do well anyaway The levels are so cool its gets better each time you go to a new level Each level have something you must do before you go on There are alot of little places that you can fine little small heath packs get those you will need it because there is always someone trying to stop you and kill you O if you fine anything useful get that too
Sometimes the informate is right there in your face you just got to look thats all
This was my only game that I own for my playstation That the time I didt know if I sould play it or leave it alone will I play it and you know what I like it for once a woman is doing the thing and I said its about time do you know what I mean
Well go have fun I did Take your time and do it right I did and I got good atLike Ive said before Tomb Raider will always stand as one of the most influential games of all time Back in  the only competition in this genre was Mario  Nowadays every other game is a d adventure in the vain of Tomb Raider
The game is very solid Well placed and thought provoking puzzles Some nice action great graphics which still hold up today and lots of fun The only complaint is the lack of a decent ending and that I have to shoot a fellow human at least  times in order to kill him How untrealistic is that
While TR  is the best in the series this one will be the most remembered
Story 
Graphics 
Sound 
Fun Fun classic PS I like to collect old games so it was a nice surprise to me that it was a collectors edition It has some playable demos and some watchable demos at the beginningGot the game After I came home from work it was on the kitchen table My brother probably got to the mailbox first I hope it is good My little nephew wanted to play it with meI played this game when i was a kid and forgot all about it Then remembered it ordered it and have been having fun playing itAlrighty let me just start off by saying dont let people who play Final Fantsay  sway your judgement about this  While Final Fantsay  is an amazing game it varies VERY HEAVILY from Fighting Force so what some people like fun fighting gamesand others love RPG gamers we are at war with the worlds  Its better to agree to disagree here  Okay let us begin with the review  I love this game  From the very beginning where you can choose your favorite character Mace Daniels is my personal favorite to the last moment when you deliver a crushing blow to your enemy  It is ingenius  I love how you can pick up weapons like guns and bats and that you can deliver really snazzy throwsblocks  Like people have said it is like a Streets of Rage for the now  Let me break it down overall for you

  Graphics Compared to now it is not up to bar  Compare it to when it frist came out bar none   although the animation can sometime slow down

  Sound Aint nothing more prettier than hearing your enemies bone crunch  

  Control Obviously this is the blacksheep of the family  The controls are clunky and choppy and sometimes they interfere with the great gaming experience  Thank God for infinite health codes   ouch

  Overall Aside from the controls being what they are the game is a smooth ride of fun fighting and brainless beatemup  I feel this game is totally undercredited and that we need to change that  ONLY YOU CAN PREVENT FOREST FIRESThis game is very fun I have only played a demo that my cousin has but Im dying to pick up a copy The demo is short and we like to come up with different themes to it like were going to a party at the building at the end of the demo This game is kind of funny Some of the enemies are pure fools I like to run around the van with them chasing Then I turn around and and knock the crud out of them I like the guns and sticks that you can pick up and when you run out of ammo you can throw your gun at the enemies Thats pretty funny too The characters have awesome moves I love fighting games and this is one of my favorites If you like fighting games and games that are just plain fun buy this gamegreat set of guides no shipping damage all books are in great shape  no misprints or upsidedown pageswell worth the investmentThis is a pretty fun game if you like hardcore killing games then this is for you this game rocksTomb Raider  is by far the best sequel game out right now Lara kicks way morein this one then in the first Some of the reasons why are listed here

Tomb Raider  is an awesome game but my favorite in the series has to be Tomb Raider 
Below i have included a list in order of my favorite Tomb Raider games
 Tomb Raider 
 Tomb Raider  Last Revelations
 Tomb Raider 
 Tomb Raider  Chronicles
 Tomb RaiderFrom the Great Wall of China to the canals of Venice Tomb Raider II is the rare case in which a sequel is better than an original In fact I find this game to be my favorite of the series In it the legendary Lara Croft sets out to find the Dagger of Xion In her quest she navigates the globe and even takes a couple of trips to strange and magical new worlds
Tomb Raider II offers significant improvements over the original and its game play exceeds the other games that follow in the series The game has drastically overhauled weapons and artificial intelligence Though the puzzles are not as hard as later versions they still are quite difficult Lara has new moves many new weapons and more dangerous foes What more could a Tomb Raider fan  or even the casual gamer  ask for
I highly recommend this game whether you are an avid Tomb Raider fan or somebody new to the series I dont believe you will be disappointed  in fact you will probably find many hours of action filled entertainment And if you do enjoy it I strongly recommend other games in this seriesTomb Raider II is the best of the series followed by the original After this the series went downhill The first level is actually quite challenging They dont mess around they throw you right into the fire But it here or on psn either way get this gameI absolutely love this game this game is really hard but fun once you get the hang of it long Ive played more than  hours and I still havent beat itAn astounding commercial success in  and still holds up well today Tomb Raider  was a step in the right direction  It had vast improvements over the first  From using flares to light up rooms to driving some vehicles it was a lot of fun  Also Laras moves are improved  The back flip and doing a  in the air combo was one of the best
The game was a lot more challenging than the original  The first one you only fought a total of  different characters with guns  In this one you fight multiple enemies with guns  Also the gauntlet you run on the first stage is probably more challenging than anything in the original  I played this game so much I can still play it through beginning to end and get every secret without any hints  One of my top favorite five video games of all time  And a true high water mark for Play Station  and maybe video games in generalThey took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good These games are still great for people looking for a challenge but I would advise firsttime players to play the series in order as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficulttolearn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises But even though there isnt as much actual Tomb Raiding in this one it is definitely a step up from the previous version Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Laras house is raided by a Mafia strike team Although does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game The extended version has two more levels but its only for the PCTheses are real video games the ones you work on for weeks before you finally reach that last awesome cutscene concluding the game Youll never feel such joy until you play this
Its definitely different than the first In the first there were only an handful of human enemies and this one is loaded with them Making you more carful to conserve ammo and medi packs
The weapons human enemies carry vary from regular old pistols to flame throwers There are also Dobermans sharks eels tigers vultures rats and spiders Plus some swordsmen in the Floating Islands youll see
You earn more weapons as you progress including pistols harpoon gun uzis shotgun and M You can drive motorboats ski mobiles

there are other things to look out for besides enemies like suspicious pressure pads doors that you are approaching which sometimes open and an bat wielding goon comes out Or simply break away floor boards If there is one hint I can give you is that Always draw your pistols when your going down an new hallway Youll be glad you did
This game is still full of an lot of things and quite frankly it still freaks me out to play Its sheer awesomness and I recommendThis game is amazing The level design and all the awesome puzzles make this game the best TR game Ive ever played This one is perfect to start if you are too young and never had a chance to play the Tomb Raider classics from PS After playing this one play  then   then  Tomb raiderTHE BEST SERIES EVER ESPECIALLY THE CLASSICS ONES FROM   This is one of those classic games that everyone who was a fan of Playstation  must own aside from the st Tomb Raider of course Got it used but it works greatI recently backtracked and played all of the earlier Tomb Raider games avoid Angel of Darkness  Horrible game  TR is about as fun as they come Graphics are outdated of course but there is so much to do and to much fun to be had  The game is long keeps your interest has plenty of cool weapons and a good story  Id love to see this game redone with todays technology   out of 

If youre a TR fan and havent played this Id advise that you doI recently started replaying this game to find that it is actually quite fun I remember first playing this game when i was a little kid at my friends house but never gave it any attention I just thought of it to be boring and hard But since i remembered it i sadly asked him if i could borrow it and he said sure keep it So i did Anyways when i started it up i remembered everything about the first mission very hard especially without anymore ps memory cards When i finally beat the first mission The Wall It sadly took me hours because after those tumbling rocks after you you got ran over easy and died Every time you die you have to restart the whole mission so this is what took me the most time Soon i got on to the second mission i got pretty far but then the disc old and scratched up quit on me It kept freezing I have had this problem many times before on the first mission so i had to restart it back up again After that i pretty much quit This is why i keep all of my games in their cases So they will work about  years later Sorry for such a bad review but later i looked up online and watched the whole thing well the missions in speedy time And saw how good the game layouts and graphics were I really enjoyed this game well the first couple missions of it So maybe i will buy a ps memory card and start to savin soonthis is a good game here and i recommend it to anyone who likes adventure type games  out of this game lacked the ability to live up to name Tomb Raider its more of a City Raider half the levels deal with citytime scenery and  of the enemies are humans more like a  than a Tomb Raider  but the game play is fun in the cities Venice so i cant complain too much  just wasnt feelin the whole China scene I liked to level skip those and the twist at the end was a lil boost  so all in all ill give it stars  but it lacked challenge for me  i beat it in a week just run around and jump for the most partThe first Tomb Raider was a classic in terms of its D gameplay sense of exploration through massive levels and a unique main character  The nd installment in the TR series is not much different  The levels are still HUGE and exploration is still the name of the game  But this time around the environments and enemies are more varied there are more actionbased enemy sequences than the first and the difficulty level has been approriately increased  In terms of the level of challenge I feel that this is the best in the series  The later Tomb Raider series felt frustrating and downright cheap at times  This one is definitely not a cakewalk but is very possible without a strategy guide  You dont feel as though you have to play for half an hour just to get into the next room  Progress is slow but steady and you dont ever need  or  different items to move on  Progress is more based on actually getting where you want to go rather than finding the right items or hitting the right combination of switches  Some of the level designs are incredible such as the Venicebased levels the Opera House the beastly Barkhang Monestary and the massive Temple Of Xian  This is the key strength of the first two TR installments and why the more recent ones have been less inspiring  Resourcefulness and attention to the environment is extremely key as medipacks are in light supply in this game  Also every level has  secrets in the form of dragons  You do not receive the bonus items unless you find all  dragons in the level making exploration even more vital in building your inventory  Finding at least  of the dragons in every level should be quite easy but some levels have one especially wellhidden dragon  The gold dragons in the first two levels are remarkably difficult but the reward of finding them especially the first one is worth it  If you didnt like the first Tomb Raider this game wont change your mind  If you were blown away by the first installment or even the rd th or th then this game is a real treatTomb Raider  is my absolute favourite PlayStation game of alltime I bought the game in December  around the same time I got my PlayStation But I never really liked Tomb Raider  and only managed to get halfway through the first level before forgetting about it for a while Four years later in the summer of  I dug it out again and decided to give it a go with the help of a strategy guide What a shock I got

After the phenomenal worldwide success of the original Tomb Raider in November  the Eidos Interactive guys put together the sequel which in a rare case surpasses the original with flying colours To save the game in the first you had to find a crystal before continuing wheras in Tomb Raider  you have the ability to save the game whenever you feel like This comes as a great help especially before taking off into a running jump over deep caverns and steep slopes Lara also has much greater weaponary comapred to the last game The first game featured Pistols Shotgun and Uzis  that was about it But with this game you get weapons such as the Grenade Launcher and an M Assault Rifle While Tomb Raider  focused more on enemies in animal form Tomb Raider  has a more worldly feel because the foes are mostly human But the most notable change on Tomb Raider  is the welcome addition of vehicles Tomb Raider featured none what so ever but Tomb Raider  has a wide variety from the enjoyable speedboat in Venice and the snowmobile in Tibetian Foothills Lara also took advantage of a makeover The graphics where background scenery is concerned is still the same as the first game but Lara herself has changed a lot her hair is no longer tied in a bun but flows freely down her back in a pony tail The reason this wasnt featured in the first game is because the technology wasnt good enough for her hair to be in a pony tail  they couldnt get it to move in motion with her body rather silly when you think about it now Lara also possesses the ability to climb certain surfaces The improved engine also served better lighting facilities which allowed Ms Croft the ability to wield flares whenever she finds herself in dark areas When it comes to the levels the highlights are Venice Offshore Rig Tibetian Foothills short but sweet  involves driving to one end of a road over pits to find a key before driving all the way back to open a door that allows you to exit and begin the next level Barkhang Monastery HINT Whatever you do DONT shoot the monks they are here to help They will dispatch any henchmen who try to kill you so you dont have to kill them Accidently shoot one and youll have hundreds of monks trying to kill you and Temple of Xian

OVERALL GRADE 

Tomb Raider  is in my opinion the greatest PlayStation game there has ever been Yes the graphics are laughable now because they have come so far since  especially on the PlayStation  and XBox but it all boils down to how enjoyable the game is And in that category it is still the most enjoyable and exciting game ever Hundreds of titles try to replicate the suspense and adventure that is seen in the Tomb Raider games and fail miserably Buy this now from Amazon  itd be a shame not to and to ignore it would be missing out on one of the most classic video games of all timeThis game is great to get into and back again never mind So the levels are great you get to go Tibet China Venice and a sunken ship The background is not so good but its ok And you get small heath and large heath packs These heath packs will be somewhere in the game keep a good eye out for them
Arm yourself with
automatic pistols harpoon gun rocket launcher M rifle Uzis shotguns flares and more
Kill them or be kill by
monks yetis great white sharks killer eels dobermans and more BE CAREFUL PLEASE
Your quest is for THE DAGGER OF XIANIts hidden somewhere out there I know do you
And the good news is lara is BACKI thought id reviewed already but here goes  Not your typical ninja game as most are stealth this one is more the action side of things tons of weapons some special powers projectiles and level kind of puzzles Think ol school brawlers final fight meets D as a ninja Cool art to be seen but not cool enough to forget it takes awhile to load as you look at it load screen  Fast paced and fun easy controls and cool lvl design One other thing is graphics moderate maybe for ps but just bad by todays standards when some pss still hold up better  But that is overlookable as it doesnt hinder gameplay and is so much fun to play your just a bad azz ninja In short bad grfx long loads but still so worth being this ninjaI used to love this because the graphics were great with the best cenery seen in a Ninja game on the PLAYSTATION The problem is you collect power ups for your shurikunsthrowing starsthat make them pretier and powerfuler when you die you have to look for more treasure chests as you progress through the game
Ive recently bought NINJA GAIDAN for XBOX and that game reminded me of this with the great cenery and graphicsStreet Fighter is perhaps the definitive fighting game series Should you feel it necessary to buy absolutely every individual cartridgedisc of the six games contained on the two SF Collections then do so and spend a ton of cash They are all excellent titles but the two collections of a game that defined the fighting genre are perfect Street Fighter Collection the original that is in the spotlight is actually the more uptodate one While it does not contain the original Street Fighter II it does contain  classic Street Fighter games First is Super Street Fighter II The New Challengers released on SNES and Genesis in  It was mindbendingly good the first time I played it It had a solid  fighters All  from Street Fighter II the bosses plus  new characters never heard of before Cammy Dee Jay Fei Long and T Hawk You might think Oh wow a new edition with new fighters Never seen THAT before Well youre wrong Super Street Fighter II did contain  new arenas respectively the ones for the new fighters It also had newly mixed music newly animated profile shots and newly animated backgrounds Basically it was a perfect upgrade Super Street Fighter II Turbo is also included It may seem like Super Street Fighter II with the speed like Street Fighter II Turbo but it added something Each character had one SUPER MOVE From Ryu and Kens Shinkuu Hadoken to Chun Lis Kikousho they really gave a great new edge to the series Akuma is even hidden in this upgrade Also the definitive of the three Street Fighter Alpha games Street Fighter Alpha  gets upgraded to Street Fighter Alpha  Gold Edition Cammy is added on and Evil Ryu becomes playable YAY Whats strange is that some of the cast gets an additional playability in their SFIICE animation So its definetely worth picking this upif you dont already have all three of these games for your SNES Alpha  is also on the PSThe one thing people are missing to consider about this game is that if you notice the collection is a collection indeed and a fine one at that but mostly shows how the Street Fighter series evolved  If you note that it goes from Super Street Fighter II to SSFII Turbo to SF Alpha  gold  Well my point is that it shows in order how the series evolved to becoming more complex and technical with Super Combos added  st it starts with Super II no supers at all just classic then goes to Super II Turbo where the super combo made its debut and every body had only one super then goes to Alpha  Gold where it really shows what you can do with a super combo plus more characters and every body had atleast  super combos
Lets go over it
st  classic with no supers lots of characters
nd  classic with supers making debut same amount of characters
rd  advance from nd with more characters and  supers for each
Not only that but its a classic game mostly to me just an example of the evolution of the series if you are still looking for what you thought this game would be get the nd one otherwise its a wise decision to go with this oneUse to play this as a kid and when I played it it brought back all kinds of memories from my childhood Definitely a game to have if you are or were a fan of wrestlingdiv idvideoblockRQPTNOILD classasection aspacingsmall aspacingtopmini videoblockdivinput typehidden name valuehttpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesIEZmFyilRSmp classvideourlinput typehidden name valuehttpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesIzLxqwCaSpng classvideoslateimgurlnbspWatch it in higher quality here httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqHocdBRRLw

I am giving away a brand new copy of the collectors guides of Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks enter the giveaway here httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvGqlSIUtMw

Check out the rest of my Zelda collection here httpswwwyoutubecomplaylistlistPLWITUaLHZlKUVzGaKKJQSDPWJfRThe game works great no problems after several sittings Fun game and worked great what is not to like Came in the mail fastI played this game a lot when I was little It was always fun and I enjoyed it The music in the background the colors the graphics its all great The coolest thing is that this game is one of a kind and it is really a good one to add to any Nintendo  collection Gameplay is easy and overall a really awesome gameIf you like Mario Kart  then you will absolutely love this game Its sort of a rendition of Mario Kart  but instead of riding karts your riding snowboards Now in my biased opinion I love snowboarding games and this one was a classic among my friends and me

I recently played it again and noticed several pros and cons that made it such a good game It had hilarious sound effects great controls a few varieties of boards to chose from and solid looking graphics It is also fun to get power ups and shoot down your friends to get in the lead Whats really cool about this game is the chair lift at the end of the run To get back to the top of the mountain you have to go up a chairlift but the chaos that happens to be the first person to ride the chairlift is hilarious The only thing that turns people off from the game is that there are only four riders to choose from and theyre all little kids In other games like Mario Kart there is more characters to chose from but the character choices are only a minor con It also has an incredibly babyish look towards it that can be a slight turn off for older kids  But once you can read past its cover the game can be so much fun to play with friends and family It is almost nothing like the immature style the game gives off

Overall I rate this game a solid  out of  because it is fun and exciting and in my opinion better than Mario Kart This game is a lot of fun with a creepy atmosphere that revolves around the disappearance of Agents Mulder and Scully Ive heard some complain that they wish Mulder and Scully were in the game more but I think you  still see enough of them to keep most fans happy plus I found the  character of Agent Willmore whom you play to be very likeable The  storyline is very strong the puzzles make sense and the full motion video  FMV sequences are very good There are not very many FMV games around  anymore so if you like your adventure games with video sequences this is  really a must haveAs a fan of Myst and Riven I would not put this game in the same  category  However it does equally well for its type  Myst and Riven  dont have a main character that you are per se whereas in this game you  have a name and a face
The game puts you in the shoes of one agent Craig  Wilmore  He is put on a case to find the missing Xfiles staff Agents Fox  Mulder and Dana Scully  As an Xfiles fan I found this game very  entertaining  As a gamer it was well within the genre of adventure games  There were hints stuff to pick up things to do etc  This was well  within the capabilities of nonX filers and should be equally entertaining
I likened this game to the Gabriel Knight  The Beast within and  Phantasmagoria  Unlike Phantasmagoria there were no gory scenes of which  I was thankful The people were movies of real people and not cartoons  The dialgue though limited offered enough variability One important point  would be to save often  I got killed alot
The game had enough of a  plot you could figure out what to do next  That is essential rather than  blindly clicking on everything you could pick up
All in all a good buy  Whens the next oneFlying the Star Wars ship was super fun and bringing down those Imperial Walkers is super funIve always been a fan of the Twisted Metal series and this third installment doesnt disappoint Some familiar characters from the other two games reappear here but there are also some cool new characters The music rocks and the stages are full of challenging situations Be ready to get your drive onSo happy I got a childhood game of mine This is absolutely amazing I missed it so much I was  when I first got this along with bomberman and mario party N is life Thank youIve always loved this game so much granted theres a bug here or there with the audio but thats to be expected with an aged gemno idea to say about that have same with twisted metal  and twisted metal small brawl I havent play for long timethank you for having this game and in its good condition
you have increased my collection of games by oneworks just fine old school just the way it should be a huge improvement from twisted metal II  Still old school graphics but it still is fun to playI believe that any twisted metal game you purchase will be fun and exiting because the fundamentals are the same throughout all the games Seek out enemy kill and move to the next level and the cool thing is you are using cars to blow things up and getting to destroy others Also the levels are locations that we all reconciles so that adds to the fun I like twisted metal  because they brought more of a D look to cheaters locations car weapons and added new cheaters to the story as well as embellish on the story line Yes the graphics are not all out there however the game play is the same and for the most part is stood true to the twisted metal franchise that was created in the beginning If you love twisted meat at all you will love this one I have played all twisted metal games and for the most part I do like them all And this one I really do like very muchI remember that this game used to be extremely advanced for its age and the graphics on it are still pretty much spot on Love the game and is now in my game collectionThis game is fun to play just for looking at all of the scenery I enjoy all the brilliant colors and the array of monsters to kill This is a Quaketype game but is better in everyway except the weapons Just plain  funLet me start by saying this is the best product Ive ever purchased Only  for  amazing great quality guides in a well built chest and a golden bookmark These are top notch guides well written and well put together
HEADS UP Theres only  copies being released and my number according to the certificate is around  Thats how many theyve sold in just over a year If you want this dont hesitate
Also these guides are going for so much seperately Ive seen used copies go for more than this set alone Imagine in  years These will be well worth more than you pay right nowHow can anyone not like this game I dont know about you guys but i still like to play this as weel as twisted metal  even though i just got an  i will still play this wheneverTHANK YOU FOR THIS GAMEMY NEPHEWS KEEP PLAYING THIS GAME THEY SAY THAT IT IS SO MUCH FUN THEY KEEP FIGHTING TO SEE WHO IS GOING TO WIN THE GAME THANK YOU SO MUCHOriginally playing Rogue Leader Star Wars Rogue Squadron  its great to get back to the keystone that started the whole franchise While not allowing for some of the more advanced gameplay from future games this product is and was fantastic for the age of N era gaming A much needed classic to add to the collection for sureI picked this up in a pack of two other N games for five dollars at a used game store Now usually those bundle deals have all of the mediocre N games in them that no one wants to buy individually However Star Wars Rogue Squadron is easily one of the best N games Ive ever played

Story The game appears to take place between A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back in the Star Wars universe Youre Luke Skywalker the original trilogys protagonist and a fighter pilot for the Rebel Alliance Youll help people with vital intelligence defect from the Empire protect Rebelallied cities and of course fight the Empire

Gameplay Unfortunately you never get to wield a light saber or anything Thats not what this game is about Its a spaceshooter You travel to different planets in your Xwing or  one of the other Rebel spaceships and do missions

Sound There may be an N game with more audio than Rogue Squadron but Ive never played it if so and Ive played entirely too many of them P Theres so much voiceacting Theres lengthy descriptions of every ship in the Rebel Fleet backstories for Rogue Squadrons fighter pilots and of course inlevel communication between the pilots

Graphics Its a very nice job by Factor  here Of course it looks dated by now but in the grand scheme of things Id say its aged pretty gracefully Make sure you have an expansion pack for your system to get the full effect

Replay Value You get medals for doing well enough in every stage Im told that if you get medals in every stage you can unlock secret missions like the Battle of Hoth from Empire Strikes back and the Death Star run If thats not incentive to beat this game  what is

Its clearly a classic N game worthy of being mentioned in the same breath as Goldeneye and Ocarina of Time Id only that having a decent N analog helps a lot If your controllers analog is dying due to wear and tear youll have a hard time towards the end of the gamestar wars rogue squadron is hands down the best n game ever made get this game even if youre not a star wars fan you wont regret itThis has to be one of the best Star Wars games ever made Its on par with Jedi KnightDark Forces  and Knights of the Old Republic Its one of the first games to nail the dog fights from the st Star Wars films The controls are great and its easy to get used to It shows off planets that are both new and familer from the films like Hoth If your a Star Wars nut like me get itI was feeling nostalgic last week so I started playing Unreal again  Probably for my third time through at this point  While Unreal doesnt have as much replay value as a game like Half Life it certainly does have its moments  Unreal was one of those really impressive FPS games for its time  It boasted great graphics and intense game play  Of course by s standards these graphics merely look silly  But if you were picking this up in  like I was you were pretty impressed

I figure Ill throw in some points about playing this on a more current system since I experienced some issues here and there  Being a game made for Windows  it doesnt translate perfectly over to an XP  bit system  I have no idea what this would do on Vistas  bit architecture  Basically when reinstalling it I got a strange error with the option to ignore  You can definitely get away with doing that and then it will install fine  Strangely every time you reinsert the disc to play some more you have to cancel out of the install process and that ignore message comes up as well  Im not sure if this is just my system but I recommend saving quite frequently at least every time you hit a load screen  For some reason the game will randomly crash after a little while and it exits out completely for you  This can be frustrating if youve been playing for a while because it doesnt auto save between load screens  Otherwise it played very smoothly on the newer system  You can also get the Unreal Anthology which has been updated to handle Windows XP  Oh and this was on a Pentium   ghz system

That being said Ill move onto the actual review for anyone thinking about delving into this great game for their first time  The first thing you notice is that you have almost no health  You begin to discover why as you start wandering around a crashed space ship and it appears you were some kind of prisoner  Naturally the first things you need to do are finding some health and then find some way out of the ship  The ship is kind of a boring part of the level but it leads you a bit into the story line because you clearly crash landed on an alien planet  When you finally get out of the ship the first thing youll notice is how amazing and stunning the world is that has been created for you  Outside its very bright and vibrant in spots  This felt a little different compared to games like Quake Half Life Doom because a lot of those games are very dark and have a major dungeon crawl atmosphere to them  Unreal has a lot of that usual stuff as well but it also has a lot of time spent outside where you get to see amazing scenery  One thing the developers did right was making you feel like the in game world was huge  This was really impressive and fun when you first got into it

As you explore and interact with the world you learn more about whats going on with this planet called Na Pali  Apparently the native people are called the Nali and theyve been enslaved by an alien race called the Skaarj  The Nali are extreme pacifists and I cant help but think their designers wanted them to be Buddhists for the most part  The Skaarj on the other hand are the main enemy of the game though not the only enemy creatures youll face  They are a warrior race that pretty much takes over wherever it sees fit  Youll notice that the Skaarj design is clearly influenced by Predator  They have a humanoid lizard design and have a mouth design that looks just like that of a Predator  To brandish even MORE similarities they also have energy weapons and steel double claws attached to their arms  As you can see this isnt very original  Another part that is kind of unoriginalstrange is the Nali castles that you come across  They are clearly living in what we would term a medieval level society versus the Skaarj who have high grade technology  Strangely you come across large castles that look like theyre straight out of thirteenth century England  I know strange for a race of pacifists  Despite all this those parts are some of the most fun to play through  I loved going into the castles and running around

Another aspect that made Unreal very special when compared to other FPS games was the sheer amount of atmosphere that is injected into this game  It truly does feel like youre on an alien world  The sounds the textures were all there perfectly bringing you into this world almost so much that you didnt want to leave  You even hear echoes off of cliffs if youre walking through a cavern its like they tried to get as many little details in order to immerse the user  For its time the Unreal graphics engine was also very impressive and really took things up a notch in the gaming world  They also programmed enemies to react more realistically to the user when confronted  So when Im fighting against the Skaarj enemies they will actually make an effort to jump out of the way of my shots  This was really cool to see and I really only found that in games like Half Life

The maps you have to navigate through are pretty massive at times  I really felt like a lot of the level design was also influenced by the great game Marathon  A lot of times in order to open a door you have to search out a series of levers or whatever in order to proceed onto the next section  This game literally has hours of game play and probably took me in the vicinity of  to  hours to complete so you really get your moneys worth  The downfall to having such large maps is its kind of easy to get lost sometimes if youre trying to complete certain tasks  Another detriment to the game was the lighting  I put this game on maximum brightness levels in order to help me see where I was going  Sometimes that wasnt even bright enough  There are sections of this game that are absolutely dark especially towards the end of the game  While this creates a very scary atmosphere I felt it hindered the game play once in a while  The reason this hurts game play is because the flashlight function is incredibly annoying to deal with  You have to pick up flashlights or flares in order to see in the pitch black areas  Now to make it more realistic the flashlights eventually run out of batteries or something but this was poorly incorporated because they only last a few minutes  Seriously the flashlights in real life would NOT die so quickly and then its up to you to go find another one  The only reason this hurts the game is because if you no longer have light you cant enjoy the environment nearly as much

Aside from a couple flaws this is a pretty awesome game and I had a lot of fun playing it  In  this came out around the same time as Half Life and they were both the must play FPS games that year  Half Life ultimately won the game of the year slot mainly because of story line  Unfortunately Unreals story line is pretty poor in the greater scheme of things  The user doesnt really feel a greater purpose to their mission and instead you are merely trying to complete levels and puzzles  Whereas Half Life created a vastly well written world where you were trying to get out of a facility and stop an experiment gone out of control  Unreal just couldnt compete with something of that caliber and its not nearly as engrossing on that level  Beautiful world and really fun to play overall but not the best of the year

Overall Rating  out of The game may be old but its still fun as hell The scenery and graphics are really not that bad at all Quite a change from traditional fps games which is definitely a good thingWhen the day I got unreal and tried it I loved it so much I started calling up friends and telling them how incredible that
game was the gameplay is one of best gameplay ever experienced
in a game you are a prisoner in a prisoner vessel heading
to a prison moon believed to be calledthe prison shipVortex
Rikers But when the skaarj detect you and pull you on to the once peaceful planet of NaPali then all goes wrong your best friend gets eaten by a skaarj you barely manage to escape a now turned to a skaarj slaughter prison vessel you reach outside grounds and say this cant be real no its not its UNREALUnreal takes you through  heart beating breath taking missions where you fight for life to survive collecting items
like defenses and weapons travel through temples facilitys castles bases mountians journey through what napali has to offer and end up and the skaarj mothers ship confronting the queen skaarjunaided and alone I would indenefinetley recommend this game to first person scifi fan shootersThis game is a fantastic classic first person shooter Good adventure By looking at the unreal price on unreal you shouldnt have to consider buying it or not Buy it thats an amazing price for a great gameI have got to be honest even if it means sacking my reputation I have never played a game so much before in my life I only own the N still for this game I have thrown out all others This game brings such a Movie like experience along with great missions craft and imperial action that I have never seen anything to its likeness You have got to get this game under all circumstances if you are a Star Wars fanWell Im going to have to agree with Darth Vader on the strong part But as for the force part Im nonchalant Star Wars Rogue Squadron begins somewhere in between Star Wars Episode IV and Episode VI Let me just say youll be visiting place in the Star Wars universe and doing missions that have no bearings to the movies which is good with me The graphics in the game are some of the best youll ever see on the N The music and the atmosophere of the game are very well done This is I would say the best Star Wars Rogue Squadron game ever made Oh and by the way yes I have played Star Wars Rogue Squadron Rogue Leader I fully recommend this game And thats my review Remember Be a customer Not a consumer Period Jake Smithersthis is one of the best star wars  N games they have made i say if you have a N get this GAME need i say moreI loved this game when I first played it I still play it even today the graphics where awsome the sound was cool the levels where all kinds of stratageys and the expansion pack worked great with it The cheats to fly the falcon tie fighters naboo fighter ect all made the game even better There is even a secret little mini game where you can control a Chicken Walker ATST and shoot up some droids and buildings in a small space

The only downfall is there is no way to get unlimited heat seeker rockets so you have to turn on your unlimited lives cheat and keep commiting suicide to get more of those rockets to win within the selected times to get the gold medal to become a Jedi And there is no nice videos to watch when you finally clock the game It just shows a quick shot of the ships flying away and then the credits roll it would be nice to have had a video type of thing like all through the game

Apart from that this game rocked my the Shwartz be with youAll the major Zelda games in super cool hardbound guides  A must have for the Zelda fanaticWhen the N system first kicked off one of its first titles was Star Wars Shadows of the Empire  Shadows was a very entertaining version of novel it was based on  It had challenging yet rewarding levels and overall solid gameplay  However it had two marks against it  The first was that graphics had not fully realized the potential of the N and resembled SuperNES games on certain boards  The second is that except for the sheer enjoyment of the playing the game again Shadows lacks any real replay value  The introduction of Star Wars Rogue Squadron based on a series of very successful novels to the N environment corrected these problems and set a whole new standard for actionadventure games on ANY platform

Rogue Squadron focuses on the missions of the famed Rogue Squadron thought to be the most dangerous and lethal fighter pilot unit in the entire galaxy  Led by the legendary Wedge Antilles the squadron fights  regular missions and  bonus missions ranging from defending the homestead on the deserts of Tatooine to rescuing prisoners from the spice mines of Kessel to battling the terrifying World Devastators on Mon Calamari  That just barely scratches the surface of the exotic locales where missions take place  The graphic environment is much more advanced this time around  No more static matte backgrounds  Everything is fluid and moves with the player  The gameplay has also been enhanced  Greater control is afforded to the joystick button on the control pad when it comes to manipulating the ships  Overall it makes for a spectacular gaming experience

Rogue Squadron also adds a new twist that dramatically enhances its replay ability  It awards medals bronze silver gold for defeating a level with increasing degrees of efficiency  Achieving all of a certain kind of medal on all the regular missions also unlocks bonus missions  This creates a greater challenge and a greater sense of accomplishment once the challenge has been met

There is only one minor quibble about Rogue Squadron  In the game designers quest to make a very demanding game they make some of the levels almost too hard to defeat even with the highest level of skill  The most glaring example of this is the level Raid on Sullust  Flying as a supposedly heavily armored YWing one is supposed to be able to fly skillfully and defeat the mission  However the board is heavily populated with missile turrets that defend each of the  targets that must be hit  With skillful flying it may be possible to knockout  or  of those targets and corresponding guns and turrets before dying but on the life its likely the next ship could be destroyed in less than  seconds  With only  ships per mission its impossible to defeat that mission without using the unlimited lives cheat code which will NOT be revealed here  However theres no shame in using that code and it is necessary if one intends to achieve the silver or gold medals  So its a minor annoyance

Rogue Squadron raised the bar to an exceptionally high level for actionadventure games that other platforms have repeatedly shown a failure to meet  Nintendo still gets it though as it followed this game with the even more successful Rogue Leader for GameCube  Rogue Squadron is a must have for any serious gamers libraryIf I had to pick one word to describe this game it would be amazing  Rogue Squadron pushes the N to its maximum power graphically which can be further enhanced by an expansion pack I strongly recommend going with one it makes the game run smoother  The gameplay couldnt be more entertaining I often wonder how my little Nintendo  is able to handle all that this game has to offer  The missions you fly in this game vary from escorting ground troops into combat all the way to launching full foward attacks on monstrous Imperial ships  The AI is pretty strong depending on the difficulty level but when it comes to your own wingmen helping you out just forget it  Environments in this game are incredible for a Nintendo  game and I give the designers alot of credit for putting so much work into them  Cant get youre hands on the new Rogue Squadron Rogue Leader for Gamecube Pick this up to satisfy youre urge if you do own Rogue Leader or even dont plan on getting it pick this title up anyways for a hell of a gaming experienceLucasArts has really outdone itself with this great N game  After Shadows of the Empire was released it quickly became obvious that the best level in the game was the first level where you are flying a Rebel Airspeeder during the Battle of Hoth  LA decided to make a whole game using a similar concept and Rogue Squadron was born  You play as Luke Skywalker leader of Rogue Squadron a group of elite rebel pilots who roam the galaxy making life difficult for the Empire and its minions  You play through  basic missions which together form a loose plot chronicling the adventures of Rogue Squadron during the time between the destruction of the first Death Star and The Empire Strikes Back  The missions range from simple searchanddestroy missions to escorting supply trains to freeing rebel soldiers from Imperial prison facilities  Along the way you must learn to handle a variety of rebel craft from the XWing to the Airspeeder  Each craft has its own strengths and weaknesses plus each craft has a special weapon which means that you are required to use each craft on certain missions  After you complete each mission you may be awarded a bronze silver or gold medal based on your performance  After completing a mission you can move on to the next one or else go back and try again to get a better score  The game gives you a score summary after each mission so you know right away which areaas you need to improve upon to get the gold
The look and feel of the game is excellent  The graphics are superb and the Expansion Pak boosts them to cinematic levels  The sound is also excellent for a nonCD game although the chatter from your squadron mates does get a little repetitive  The game is contained within a D environment giving the game a flight simulatorlike feel  The controls are pretty easy to get used to though this DOES take a little practice  Fortunately the first couple of missions are pretty easy so you get a good chance to get familiar with the controls  The controls are the same for each ship so you dont have to switch back and forth
As stated before the first couple of missions are pretty simple and easy  But starting with about the fourth mission they start to get REALLY tough with multitudes of TIE fighters missile turrets and gun emplacements all doing their best to shoot you down  Expect to die many times before mastering each mission  Getting the gold medal on all  missions will definitely take a while
The game has a lot of nice bonus features as well  As you complete missions and earn higher medals three bonus missions will appear plus you will gain access to new ships including the Millenium Falcon and a captured Imperial TIE Interceptor  There is also a passcode screen allowing you to enter codes to unlock all sorts of interesting options including a fourth bonus level and the Naboo Starfighter  There is even a code to allow you to fly a Buick sedan against the Empire  The codes themselves are pretty easy to get  There are several sites on the Internet that have them
Its easy to get immersed in the D environment of this game  Manys the time Ive found myself leaning over to the left or right as I put my XWing through a tight turn  For those who like flight simulatortype games I would say that this is the best FS game on the N  Its a bit dated now what with the impending release of Rogue Squadron II for the GameCube but for those N fans out there this one is a musthaveThis game is great for Star Wars fans There are eleven single missions but there are three bonus missions too The first is a race on Tatooine where you fly a T Skyhopper in a race against three of your squadron mates The second is the Death Star Trench Run which the developers in my opinion over did because the trence is HUGE and it has to many turns The best bonus level is the Battle of Hoth The graphics and music are superd just like every other Lucasarts and Factor Five  game Their are also secret vehicles You can pilot the Naboo Starfighter by using a secret code go to Lucasarts website the Millunium Falcon and the TIE Interceptor can be earned when you complete the game by getting all the gold medals It doesnt take long to beat this game if your good at games like this but ot does offer a pretty good challenge Now go join the Rebellion and vaporize those TIE FightersRogue Squadron  Every Star Wars fan knows the elite starfighter group of pilots  Now you get the opportunity to experience what it feels like to hop into the cockpit of an XWingYWingAWing VWing Millenium Falcon TIE Interceptor and the Naboo Starfighter  As you fly through over  missions ranging from Tatooine to Mon Calamari youll earn ranks in the squardronthe highest Ive gotten is Gold Leader  With each mission you complete youll earn a medalbronze silver or goldand be promoted  Do you have what it takes to buy this game and prove youve got what it takes to be a top fighter pilotFirst the single player is awesome Then the multiplayer battle gets even better But then when you add Game Shark it becomes the best game ever One problem is that it is a bit unrealistic because there are up to  shots in a clipmagazine Otherwise the game is good Also if you like this game you will want Perfect Dark If you like this game but wish it was more realistic get Rainbow SixGoldenEye  is one of the best games for the Nintendo  When you hear pepole say the game is Great There not kiddin  Ive had This game for a while And Im still coming back to it Its an  Replay value Id give GoldenEye  more Stars if I could If you want a game that you can come back to Years later And a GREAT game for alot of pepole Then Get GoldenEye This game falls into my categories as one of the best games ever I have played many many games in my day and havent seen one quite like this  Great controls exciting gameplay secrets many weapons what more could  you ask forA must have for all Zelda  Link fans Neat easy to use  read colorful rich in text  contentI ordered this for my fiance for Christmas Ill just say that hes been up all night playing it and was almost late for workGame works as described The condition is also in good condition I am very pleasedI love the Nintendo  I still play some games occasionally and this one was always a fun one It will frustrate you thoughCame fast and was awsome love this game one of my favorites for this system and one of the best snowboarding gamesIm  now got the game when it first came out when I was around  Still the bet snowboarding game of all time So much fun that I still get the n out here and there simply to play this game Has a time attack mode trick mode racing series and a mixture of them all Just a great classic that rates up their with  Goldeneye for classic N games that could last forever for those every now and then gamers like myself Great gamethats highly reccomendedOnce you get the hang of the controls this game is awesome its challenging and entertaining and everyone should have one
This game has amazing graphics you can even see the snow spray off the board when you make the slightest turn Plus the camera controls are flawless The sound track is pretty good too you can hear the snowboard scraping and the snowboarders sometimes talk and the techo tracks that accompany the races are pretty cool too
My only complaint is that there arent enough courses After I unlocked the  courses and beat the Black Diamond level there wasnt much else to do But even after youve unlocked all the courses its still fun to play against your friends in the  Person VS mode or doing tricks in the half pipe
I think that anyone who has a N should add this game to their collection without a doubt its a solid game and you wont regret itThe game in many ways is like tony hawk  In fact the only differnt thing this snowboarding  The graphic and gameplay are good  With  differnt boarders to use and alot of tracks the game is worth the moneyGreat Order It has the guides that I need Great Price Gets down to every little detail in the gameWithout any doubt  Snowboarding is probably the best snowboarding game available
The difficulty of the controls are a little more difficult than other snowboarding games and may take a little bit more time to master but its well worth it Landing correctly is also a little harder to do than normal
The mode and track selection is very nice offering a nice variety of tracks and available modes The tracks offer beautiful scenery sometimes very big jumps jumping over cars and a lot more
The tricks and the stunts selection that you can perform is very reasonable Although you cant go beyond  degree turns there are other tricks that you might not find in any other snowboarding game
 also includes a Training mode which includes two different sections the halfpipe and a straight run with moguls When you begin you can turn into the left gate for the halfpipe to practice your tricks or you can head into the right gate for a straight downhill run with moguls scattered all over When you finish you start back up at the main gate and you keep going until you decide to quit
 also has a few secret riders and boards within the game
Overall  is probably the best snowboarding game around without any doubt Would be definitely worth buyingIll preface this by saying yes I have played through FFVII on the playstation when it first came out Ive probably played through it at least a dozen times as I just enjoy the story how it unfolds the characters you meet and the events that transpire that intertwines their stories together

Prior to this game I was mostly into sportsFPS type games An RPG heck I didnt even know what that meant at the time game was not even remotely on my list of games that were coming out that I wanted A friend of mine where I was working at showed me a gamer mag that had a full rundown of this game Indeed it seemed very impressive and the more he talked about it the more I got interested in it

Then came release day I still wasnt sold on it but after leaving work I figured what the hell Drove  minutes north to the nearest mall where a buddy mine worked at EBGames Soon as I entered he was like Did you preorder this I told him no and that I wasnt really interested in RPGs as they always sound boring and Id lose interest quick and waste my money He showed me a quick demo and I admit it got me thinking as to I wonder what happens after this I finally said sure He hooked me up with the strategy guide free tshirt and the  disc game  DISCS When I cracked open the case and saw  discs I knew this would be an epic legendary tale I just didnt know how epic

I wont go much into the characters as they have been around a long time and most know whowhat they are But the story wow I could not have been more hooked At first it started off a little slow mostly to get you introduced to the characters and get some backstory going After the nd mako reactor explosion and you get knocked into slums and fall through the church and meet Aeris it all changes The direction tone and emotion starts running higher Battles get more intense You really get the feel that something big much bigger than even all these characters is building up It all seems to point to Shinra but even as you infiltrate it something is even more disturbing JENOVA Soon as I saw that short cutscene with Cloud peeking inside its stasis chamber my jaw dropped I wanted to know what it is where it came from what they are using it for etc etc etc But thats what set this game apart The more answers you get the more questions were raised than before

The world is huge lots of explorable areas with side quests and storylines I spent alot of time raising the Chocobos and racing them to get the Gold Choco so I can access the caves that contained important and powerful items and materia

Materia System One of the best magic systems I have encountered to date While you wont use all the materia you buyfind Its the reward of seeing that glowing greenblueredyellowpurple stone that makes you fight to get it and see what it is Summons are excellent with great animation for the time it was made Knights of the Round was very long to summon but the damage and wait is well worth it

Characters Some of the most diverse ever seen and very deep with different backgrounds I think the first time I really got a sense of how immense this story was getting was when I first went into Shinra Mansion with all the creepy creatures you fight and head into the basement where all the Shinra research was stored regarding JENOVA Sephiroth and the experiments The characters sucked you in with their drive and emotion to the situations Making you want to keep going and see whats around the next corner

In conclusion for us longtimers here this game never gets old For the newcomers get ready to experience something extraordinary To quote the back of the Playstation case What erupts goes beyond imagintionThis Final Fantasy  is one of the most influenced games of all time The fan bases for this one game blows out all FF fan base out of the water Never has any other FF game seen such an influenced with multiple related gamesstory characters found in different games Multiple Movies Toys cards etc based on this game  Why was that all necessary for this one game

Its just that DAMN AWESOME This game has everything Story characters battle system music humor and more If it didnt why else did this game influenced so many other things that followed it after Because it was just damn awesome

You can play this game over and over before getting tried of it but you will keep it in your hearts forever The amazing game play the amazing characters and amazing graphics Back in those days

They just cant make anything that even comes close to what they did back then I wish they did but they cant It was just too well done lolWhen my cousin first got this on his birthday I was thinking  this is just gonna be like all the other snowboarding games Ive played  Man was I wrong  With  levels of exciting heart stopping jump twists and turns this is one game you dont wanna miss  It has all the best modes Match Racethis is where you earn hidden levels against the computer  Player Trick Attack Time Attackand Contest this is one game that wont get tiring fast  Heed this warningif you buy this game dont go after the  just yet its hard to master  What more do I have to say  Buy this gameThis game is fantastic and you wont be able to put it down for a long long time  I have over  hours played on my game save  Final Fantasy VII Platinum Edition features a revamped old soundtrackthat I find x better than the PSone versions soundtrack  Although it takes a while to adjust to the numpad controls after playing for a while youll wonder how you would have done it any other way  The onscreen controls are bizarre and during scenes such as the timed puzzle in the rocket ship youll have a hard time typing in key combos  Materia allows you to use different magics on different characters allowing for different characters to use Summons Magic and Cure  My tip dont give up solely because of the controlsthis game is FANTASTIC and although I found the console experience more enthralling and easier to jump into the PC version was much more cinematic and was totally worth it  FF is by far the best game I have ever played and you do not want to miss out on this adventure  My only tip dont save over the same file especially before you enter the Northern Crateryou wont be able to exit it if you do

Replayability  Tons of extra caves quests missions minigames to find extra materia weapons limitbreaks and bosses to fight well after the game is over

Gameplay  Amazing boss fights you will be on the edge of your seat during battles incredibly fun

Story  The plot twists the depth in the story the emotionsits AMAZING

Graphics  You can view on a big resolution better textures and stuff  More crisp than the PSone version

Controls  Takes a while to get used to you wont want to try another control setup once you do

Sound  Sound effects are recycled from the PSone game BUT the music was totally redone and that is one of the biggest parts of this game

Addictiveness  I stopped playing my other games for almost  months when I got into this game

The best part of this game is that it is so easy to pick up and play  The Ruby and Emerald Weapons provide you with more challenge than the last boss of the game  Raising chocobos and minigames at the Golden Saucer couldnt be more fun and this remains the only game besides World of Warcraft that I havent uninstalled from my computer  Final Fantasy VII is a keeper and dont be discouraged by the prices on Amazon by the time youre done with the game you will believe it to be the best  you have spent on a game  I would know because I said the same thingAn interesting aspect of the Final Fantasy series was that all of the games were essentially an experiment The first game was the ultimate experiment will this game succeed or will Square go under But each game was a stage in development

FF Choosing party and character sprites in battle

Before that the Dragon Warrior games had battle headon

FFII wounddevelopable characters

Romancing SaGa later employed this when you survive near death your hp goes up when you fight alot attack goes up etc

FFJ simple job system completely changes characters no permanent skills

FF Changing characters a dark knight becomes a paladin

FFV Advanced job system level up with one of the noncommand skills to default class and you permanently learn it for instance the run skill you can learn from the thief and then deequip it

FFVI basic GF system mainly just boosts skills

FF basic weapon system

FF GF system

FF I heard it had some sort of advanced weapon system where different weapons learn different magic never bought the game

Likewise the plot in each was experimental They fiddled around with the crystal concept in FF FFJ FF FFV  They had ruthless kings dark overlords and the occasional malicious squid But the most intense game I have played so far was Final Fantasy  Why Well when halfway through the game your character doesnt even know who he is anymore it is pretty interesting  Not to mention you have combos to build chocobos to raise and race never was good at this and some pretty weird items to collect I mean honestly what other game has you give some girl digestant in exchange for perfume and a dress for your male character to wearFF  has always been my favorite game in the whole world in fact it is my whole world  I play it everyday but I was always sad because I had to leave the playstation to go on the internet to read about and discuss FF   But not anymore  Now FF  is out on the PC and you have to buy it at any cost so that you can laugh and cry and live the greatest experience of all time the experience that is Final Fantasy  on your computer  Just thinking about it is making me tear up a little  I promise you will not be disappointed  The stunning gutwrenching visuals the passionate heartwrenching storyline the exciting ballwrenching combat system the absolutely aweinspiring charactersnothing could be more perfect  You have not lived if you have not played this gameThis is an awesome set of deluxe The Legend of Zelda video game guides The box it came in is just great and Im so happy they took the time to add to some of the books While I did have some of these books already the new and thicker Skyward Sword guide is really top notch

My only complaint is that the box comes full I have other guides and Zelda books like the historia book that I cant cram inside it with the others but thats ok They need to sell the chest on its own as I could fill another chest with the Zelda guides I already have

If youre a big Zelda fan and love the hardcover deluxe guides that they release with each game this is a great box set and totally worth itIn this world nothing is as it seems  No one is who they say they are and surprises lurk around every corner  This is a wonderful game with a rich story great side quests and great animation  The evil ShinRa corporation has been mining Mako an energy source that is the lifeforce of the Earth itself  Avalanche is an underground resistance group headed by Barret a man whos arm was lost in an explosion at a Mako refinery  Cloud is a mercenary who used to work for SOLDIER ShinRas private army  Sephiroth is a great warrior for SOLDIER who has been lost for many years  Now Cloud is working with Avalanche and Sephiroth has resurfaced but he is now an insane powerhungry man with a desire to use Black Materia to summon a meteor to destroy the world  Materia are energy sources used in weapons to add skills to the user  This game has a great story and a great battle engine where you can customize  different characters with different materia  This is a long game but it is legendaryI have always been a FF fan ever since  was out Ive been loving it ever since and was glad that i played this Let me tell you about the gameAs you have probably found out from other reviews it is about a rebel orginization named AVALANCHE who is saving the planet from Shinra Inc who is polluting the Earth One of these members is a man named Cloud a  year old guy who was in a orginazation called Soldier which is the army of Shinra Possibly the greatest plot and climax Ive ever seen Great battles they proved to be a challenge Cloud Sid and Red  are my favorite charecters Also some of the best movies in a game that ive seen for a long time Espeically the  minute ending Man that was good ENJOYGrim Fandango combines every element you look for in an adventure game in a fluent and involving fashion  The plot the comedy the political intrigues an occasional romance  All right here  One of the things I found most amusing was whenever Manny the main character  manages to build his life or is it death up again you the player  takes over and manages to ruin it in a day  Whew think I got enough  parenthesis in  If you enjoy an easygoing adventure game with a great  story to tell this games for youIf you liked Full Trottle and love LucasArts games in general youll love this game Its one of the funniest games Ive ever played The way all the charters talk hispanic is enough to me laugh out loud Manny  Calavera is the most likeable anithero youll ever have the pleasure to  control in this fantastic Land of The Dead adventure game Who said the  adventure games was dead Grim Fandango proofs them all wrongI just finished this game and I really enjoyed it If you like adventure games youll love this The graphics are spectacular and there are many new areas for you to explore as you journey though the game There are many  more areas in this game than you typically find in any type of computer  game Plus the characters are great and it actually has a storyline that  would stand up quite well all by itself My only complaint would be that  some of the puzzles didnt make sense to me At one point you take a piece  of tape off the wall and all of a sudden a character will talk to you who  never wanted to talk to you before Thats just one example Many of the  puzzles do make sense though I still think this is a game that any  adventure gamer would enjoyOnly the best Videogame of all time for nearly almost  years in a row on one of my most favorite console ever tooFinal Fantasy  is the best FF I have yet to play  I have played  and  also but  has the best music battle system and junctioning system of all of them not to mention the greatest storyline in the history of everything  Besides a couple of translation errors this game is perfect  I was introduced to Final Fantasy   years ago and I still do not know many things about it So if your looking for a long challenge ahead of you but not a challenge so hard that it sucks the fun out of it you should buy this game and before they stop selling itThis RPG is a blast to play  The graphics and battle system will blow you away when you first play it  Theres even a tutorial so you can get in the game quicker  As for the storyline excellent  The storyline goes all over the place but thats what fun about it  The game itself is also long and entertaining  It took me  hours to finish sidequests and all  You even get an amusement park filled with games and wonderful items to help you on your quest  Get this game  It will get you hoooked on hours to comeThis is the EPITOME of graphic adventures No other game has even come close to GRIM FANTANGO when it comes to humor of all shades and shapes inventiveness delicious irony creative graphics and plain goodol FUN

This is a year old game mind you  yet it retains its freshness as any true work of art THIS IS HOW COMPUTER GAMES SHOULD HAVE BEEN  and not the pathetic cookiecutter products of megacorporations working intandem with GXcard companies

Your character hilarious and lovable Manny Calavera is alreadydead when you start In fact he has been dead for some time stuck in limbo trying to pay his way to a better afterlife by selling tickets to other souls on their way to paradise Guess what corruption is not limited just to this world And where there is corruption there is oppression and where there is oppression there is always a revolution brewing

Realizing he is being duped Manny reluctantly joins the afterlife underground and takes us in a tour de force of one of the MOST BEAUTIFUL GAME EVER PRODUCED Immersing noirish atmosphere detailed artdeco settings fast Bogartian dialogs  with a subtle ironic frosting

WARNING There are known problems with todays faster processors So unless you have a really old system running Win you will need the WinXP PATCH otherwise you will not get past the crane scene

WITH THE HIGHEST RECOMMENDATIONSThis is without a doubt one of the best games ever made  adventure or otherwise It is fun amusing original colorful and challenging without being annoying The only games that came close to it may be the Monkey Island series or The Last Express The game is beautifully designed with unforgettable characters amazing landscapes and reminds me of being inside a really wellwritten movie Sadly LucasArts stopped making games like this a loss for the worldYou awake in a fairy tale world in a forest of faires in front of you is the pinnacle of a hero of time a ordinary child named link thrown into a story of magical tragedy love and war fighting with swords boomerangs and countless items in this open world rpg adventure game a classical magical artistic story of dark hope From the moment i entered the tree my deepest childish heart was immersed by The spooky chilling song of wonderus oblivion  played with a dida jiu envoks the dark gothical environment of smokey earth a hidden sign of our own earthly desires and self destruction the rest of the music is amazing and fits each place perfectly I really like the hyrule field song of mystery and adventure You gather items such as slingshots bombs magic spells and the sword of time This allows you to go to times and alter the other time to your advantage The sun and moon take turns with night and day as you run through a beautiful hyrule field a fire mountain and other magical places  A legend of revolutionary gaming experience exploration story telling magical youthfulness a pioneer of open world environments with realistic time cycles It feels like a real life fairy tale of magical gothical art and adventure This is one of my biggest inspirational and memorial games and could be yours tooI had problems with it at first  crashing but then i installed the patch that i downloaded and it worked great The game did remind me a lot of the Monkey Island series Although monkey Island id say had the best music Grim had ok music Game was funny and at the end i wanted more i finished it too fast i shouldnt have used those cheats Really recommended I wish there was a part III dont go for adventure games personally  Ninety percent of the time I prefer shooters  But this oneman its so weird so unique and so GENIUS through and through how can you not love it

Heres the story  Manny Calavera is a lowlevel salesman trying to earn an honest commission and make a decent days pay but it never seems to work out for him  His boss is constantly on his back hes routinely snaked by a competitor Domino Hurley and the right sales never come his way  Its a lousy life to have

Especially if youre already dead

Thats the twist Manny and just about everyone else in the game is dead  This whole game takes place in the Land of the Dead of MexicanAztec folklore with a strong Art Deco influence with heavy doses of s crime noir thrown in  Everyone in the game is fashioned to look like the sugar skeletons used in Day of the Dead festivals called calaveras get it

Manny works in the Department of Death trying to work off his time for his misdeeds when he was alive  He does that by trying to sell travel packages to the recently deceased so they can make their fouryear journey across the Land of the Dead until they reach the portal leading to the Land of Eternal Rest  The quality of life this person lived determines whether they get to use a car a luxury liner or the exclusive No  train which speeds its passengers there in four minutes instead of the customary four years

Unfortunately the kind of lowlifes who keep coming Mannys way only deserve walking sticks at best which does absolutely nothing to help Manny work off his time  So he decides to take matters into his own hands and STEAL the right kind of client

And thats when he gets in over his head

The story is pure crime noir with a technicolor twist like Raymond Chandler meets Tim Burton  The plot Manny uncovers is convoluted brilliant deeply twisted and diabolical like youve never imagined possible  Its also incredibly unspeakably funny  Tim Schaefer is one absurd individual make no mistake

Yes its an old game I know  But the true classics know no age and this is a classic all right  So take advantage of the price snap it up and book a trip with your new favorite travel agent  Hes waiting for youGrim Fandango has a very retro feel sort of like Casablanca with an Art Deco Aztec twist The game centers around Manny Calavera who is attempting to stay honest and make sense out of a Hispanic day of the dead afterlife which has been corrupted by those who control that afterlife for their own gain All while Manny pursues the love of his afterlife Confused Trust me it will all make sense once you start playing and the dialog and graphics will impress you and keep you hooked Ive tried a lot of the adventure games and they all have their flaws But Grim Fandango comes as close to perfect as any game ever will The controls are a little irritating but not as much as some newer games This is the best adventure game out there and I strongly recommend that you try itIf they made more games like this Id be a pauper Intelligent funny easy to use easy to solve and no bloody chess problems Its also thoughtprovoking gorgeous wellwritten and as believable as talking skeletons and elevator demons can make it One of my favorites that I play over and over again One caveat At least one puzzle seems to be tied to processor speed so if you have a fast machine youll need to download a patch from the manufacturers website Well worth the trouble thoughWords really can describe how wonderful this game is The first thing you will notice is the incredible graphics note a D card is not required Everything is drawn in great detail right down to character traits and facial expressions who would have thought a fleshless person would be so good with expressions The story is also very entertaining and added with the graphics it makes this a very absorbing adventure This is one of the few games that I cant say anything negative about This is a must haveIve never played the Playstation version of this game and this was my  first time playing any sort of Final Fantasy game  I originally purchased  it to watch the computer animation but quickly fell in love with the world  the characters and the dozens of things to do
You start off playing  Cloud or whatever you decide to name him and are an exsoldier now  fighting for a group called Avalanche who want to shut down a company  called Shinra because theyre using Mako energy to power the city  Mako  energy is the life energy of every living thing on the planet and once its  used up the planet will die  From there youre quickly plunged into a  story about love betrayal duty and saving the world
I easily got   hours of gameplay and the story blew me away  Every time yu think you know  whats going on another clue pops up and blows everything else away  Theres an even balance between combat and actual RPG where you talk to  folks in towns
This game also has great replayibility with dozens of  subquests and side games to keep you busy  Can you raise a gold chocobo  Can you defeat all three weapons  Can you find all the megaelixers  Can  you gain the secret characters  Can you find everyones super technique  and ultimate weapons
The story was amazingly detailed the characters  were all unique and the game pulled no punches  I highly reccomend itNot a whole lot to say except that as far as adventure games go this is  the standard that all others should try to exceed
Outstanding voice  acting and scripting Hilarious game without making fun of itself Tough  but logical puzzles that will have you scratching your head Beautiful and  ORIGINAL storyline movie material right here
This is what adventure  gaming was fated forGrim Fandango will definitally be enjoyed by fans of film noir and mexican mythology Id give it a  and a half if i could The graphics have their flaws and the game runs choppy on systems not far ahead of the system requirements Some of the puzzles are utterly impossible to figure out without incredible luck or the aid of a stradegy guide but the game is truly astonishing You follow the character Manny Calavera a travel agent for the dead guiding souls to their final resting place in the best way possible For some reason Manny is denied any premium clients Whos behind all this Find out over a  year journey from the dusty streets of El Marrow to the edge of the world and back again Absolutely beautiful backgrounds and film noirish music immerse you in the atmosphere Clever interface and variable controls are great A very involving game Not too long not too short Humor and wit are weaved through every scene In conclusion film noir style surreal visuals toe tapping and ensuing music gripping story charming characters and challenging puzzles will intrigue all game fansReal official game for just  I have the DS version of this game so I was curious about the original I say its worth the money unless you feel its to pricey then just get the DS version thats also  at Walmart My only complaint is that it looks a little blurry on my TV So I suggest if you want the best  games Nintendo has to offer this is definitely a dont miss I also recommend getting the N redesign analog stick hyper pak plus and a expansion pak for the best N gameplay experience everWho doesnt love GoldenEye and the once cutting edge graphics Still better then a lot of the shooters out todayThis is a must have for a Zelda collector Even if it just goes on a shelf to never be opened it looks great Some of the guides in it I never saw released Twilight Princess and I wonder how I missed them Great buy for the just over  I paid A lot of the guides by themselves are selling  eaawesome game form the s but its a little hard to play now as Ive been spoiled with two joysticks on the controller But once you get the hand of the controls then its still and amazing gameThis was truly one of the best games I have played in a long time It has challenging puzzles that may at times seem impossible but the solution is often right before your eyes Based upon the Mexican Day of the Dead it  gives the player a little bit of background while keeping them entertained  Great game lots of PI cliches mentally stimulating and just plain FUNI was very dubious when I started playing Grim Fandango  An adventure game with polygons  And the SCUMM menu interface system that was in every single past Lucasarts adventure game was gone  But I gave it a try  Thank  goodness I did
Grim Fandango is a story about Manny Calavera a travel  agent for the souls of the dead  He sells packages to the departed for  their four year journey to their just rewards and if he sells enough he  can earn enough to make his own trip someday
Imagine the theme of  Casablanca with some mexican folklore and Mayan art thrown in for fun  Add  big orange demons hot rods killer beavers cat races and the grim reaper  and you have Grim Fandango
The story is supurb and the voice acting was  top notch  Its very difficult to do a dramatic yet humorous story but  somehow this game pulls it off  Grim Fandango could yank me to the brink  of tears one moment and cause me to almost bust a gut another
The things  that make a good adventure game are all there  Logical puzzles that dont  cause your gameplay to come to a standstill until you solve them good  acting good animation and good code  If I were ever forced to reccomend  only on adventure game to someone this would be itPossibly the most original game idea in the history of adventure games Grim Fandango has a charm which is all in the execution  This is as close to being in a movie as the adventure game genre has yet allowed  Blending the tradition of Mexican folklore with the suave of sixties beat  culture and the style of The Big Combo Fandango is a sensory  explosion  Somewhat courageously it does not attempt to make its  graphics realistic  Rather it searches successfully to use its medium to  best effect  Like the best films Fandango manipulates its elements to  produce a world unto itself  Its firstrate direction and hitherto  uniquetoadventuregames D technology  points the way forward for the  adventure games
True some of the puzzles are hard but none of them  really seem out of place  Indeed there is with Grim Fandango a true  sense of plot  Maybe the characters dont develop as they do in novels or  great films but thanks to fine vocal talent and crisp writing they do  maintain charming integrity throughout
If I have a complaint with the  game it is the interface by which your character Manny communicates with  others  You choose from among several sentence options like those old  chooseanending books  Its not a bad way to play a game I  suppose but just as multiple choice tests are always easier than writing  essays being able to choose from amongst a few limited options make it  easier to get information out of the rest of the games cast  As a  result solving problems is sometimes dead simple  Of course there arent  many better options for game developers trying to give players a sense of  control of their destinies but it makes one long for the day when the  promise of a game like Titanic with its limited ability to understand  unique phrases typed in by the player might be more fully realized
Some people though might like the fact that they exhaust their  investigations of other characters pretty quickly  It does speed game  play and isnt as frustrating as trying to find the right questions on  your own might be  This is a big game with lots of scenes and lots of  people to meet  Speedofplay matters  So even if I personally believe  there must be a better way to communicate to other characters I can hardly  rate the game down for what is possibly the best solution currently  available
Thus even if you think you dont like adventure games you  should still buy Grim Fandango  Likewise if you dont have time to play  adventure games you should get a walkthrough and cheat your way to the  end because the graphics story and soundtrack are just that good  This  is one of the seminal achievements in the genre and to miss out on it  would be to accept a huge gap in your understanding of where the games  industry might be headingthe video game designerdirector and producer shigeru miyamoto is the greatest video game designerdirector and producer in the universe a true genius the best of the best the video game designerdirector and producer shigeru miyamoto rocksevery single nintendo video game in existence that miyamoto either directed or produced or designed are the greatest video games in the universe there true classics the best of the best every single nintendo video game in existence that miyamot either directed or produced or deisgned rocks My favorite first person shooter game As a matter of fact the only first person shooter game I have ever owned Rareware was at its best at that time and the game really brings back a lot of memories Continues to be great even today although the graphics havent aged wellThe Legend of Zelda Box Set looks spectacular awesome masterpiece  magnificent  Its truly miracle fantastic  unbelievable  incredible The guide books inside are very handy  useful Im completely satisfied  accepted with the method  way David Hodgson authorized the Legend Of Zelda Full Box SetI first played The Legend of Zelda not long after it was released Best Christmas gift ever I do not think there is a single negative thing I could say about this product It has the classic adventure story traveling across far out lands to save the princess all the while discovering yourself along the way When you are not in dungeons or fighting evil characters you can do a lot of fun things like explore towns go horseback riding archery hurt chickens and then try  to avoid their gang attack play your ocarina go fishing and see how large of a fish you can catch etc There is so much variety in this game that it is impossible to get bored Also the music in this game is PHENOMENAL Did you know that there is a Zelda soundtrack you can purchase There are also some guide books and online walk throughs if you find yourself a little stuck and are in need of some helpful hints

Price wise I have found Zelda games for less via Ebay but you usually have to bid on them Unless you want to pay several hundred dollars for a new in box game expect the cartridge to look used from being well loved over the yearsIf the game defines multiplayer this is the one

Other than outdated graphics and poor singleplayer experience it revolutionized firstperson shooter with slick controls intense difficulty and fun multiplayer with up to  players and more than  maps and characters to choose from

GoldenEye  was a blast from the past The best movielicense game of the  franchiseStill fun in  If you have a  and do not own this game whatre you doing Do you hate yourself Stop reading and buy this nowThis is one of the greatest games of all time Much has been said and will continue to be said
about this passage in the Zelda story What I really want to focus on is how awesome the battle mechanics are in this game it works so well and rarely any games of modern era can even touch its sword play mastery Its so satisfying to fight bosses and sword wielding enemies
Everything about this game is legendary the music the characters  the story it just leaves you wanting more This is what fantasy adventure is about standing the test of time and continuing to teach us all something great
I cant wait to revisit this on the Nintendo ds version Its a complete remaster from what Ive seenThis was my favorite game growing up so there was no question I had to get it when my wife found her old N  I got it used but it works great and starts up with no problems  Works just as good as it did when I was a kidI Just keep it around my house to feel like an awesome person Sometimes people come over and high five meIt has been called the greatest fps of all time Buy It for yourself and see why You can do it I believe in youThe Best James Bond game ever made Still has yet to be one that tops Goldeneye lol Cmon Rare make an all new original James Bond game cause we gamers NEED one pleaseWell its Goldeneye I played this as a kid back when it was new Just wanted to play it again years later lol Not as good as it was in the s but still funThank you My Zeldas both got stolen by a bum stoner a couple years ago and with a couple other games Ive recently noticed I did not expect much when I thought of looking on Amazon for games for older systems then I found this and I even got the one that came with the box and instructions Very rare deal and amazing price Thank youThis box set is a wonderful addition to any Legend of Zelda collection This set includes  Prima Guides a metal bookmark a certificate of authenticity and a magneticclosure treasure chest The Prima guides included are for the games Ocarina of Time D Spirit Tracks Phantom Hourglass Wind Waker HD Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword The guides speak for themselves they walk you through all aspects of these games giving you tips and help to complete the games All of the books are highquality hard cover with goldedged pages I am a huge fan of the Legend of Zelda and this box set was a perfect addition to my collection I would recommend this box set to any fan of this franchise plus the price on Amazon cant be beatA classic game for a classic system This game can still be sited as the best Zelda game of all time by some and if its not the best Zelda game period its definitely a top contender for the best D Zelda game A mustplay for N owners My copy was delivered as describedI bought this game because everyone in my family loves Zelda and I had been trying to find it everywhere I was so happy when I seen it on Amazon I have no complaints it works just like if it was brand new Oh the memories You Bond Me Oddjob Multilayer deathmatch Proximity mines Silenced weapons Challenges Awesome levels Replayability through the roof A game that truly belongs in almost any N game collection itseems a true classic nowThis is a really great set of players guides for the recent Zelda games and I would recommend it to all fans of the Zelda gamesWas everything I remember it being and everything I was promised I was paying for I am a serious collector and this is one of my alltime favorites Needed a replacement for a never returned copythis one was in perfect condition even better than described Buy it now while its still around every gamer needs this oneIve looked all over for GoldenEye for my old school N but never could find it Then I found it on Amazon this is a nice change from the all digital world of FPS games The graphics are not bad but if you plan on playing this on your HDTV I would recommend getting a converter that takes the VGA  Yellow White  Red  cables an converts the VGA signal to HDMI so you can play on your High Definition TV Played this on christmas with the relatives an they were having a blast Didnt think they would considering its N an not Xbox ONE

Just playing the game gives you a view of how far technology has come it might be old an not as detailed as some FPS games but still gives you a perspective of what technology used to look like back in  when the N was released Today this game remains a favorite among gamers If you have kids  a N id take the xbox away for a day an have them play N so they can see where  how technology has taken Gaming Just dont let them play  GoldenEye have them play Diddy Kong RacingThis is the Zelda game without the scary moon I always told myself as a kidThis is really quite the treat for collectors The presentation is stunning  from the fun box to the sturdy books to the certificate proving the uniqueness of your set For the hardcore Zelda fan this both useful for strategy and cool as a keepsakeAn oldy but a goody Countless hours of battles between my brothers and I Only problem was screen peeking which we solved with a screen divider made from cardboardOh yeah Definitely recommend it to anyone with a NI played this when it first came out on the Nintendo   Once I started I couldnt put it down until I beat every level on every difficulty  Back than my friends and I worked nd shift and after work would come over and play multiplayer into the morning  Occasionally I still get nostalgic and pop the cartridge in to revisit my favorite levels  The graphics are dated now but the game play is still fun  Researching the games development history to find things that never made it into the finished version but whose code is still included in the cartridge and can be accessed is interesting as well If you have an old Gameshark for instance you can use it to walk to the mysterious island off in the distance of the Dam Level  A great game all aroundI believe the year was  and I would play this game with  other friends all day every day It was like we were hooked Proximity mines rockets power weapons we played it all The single player is amazing as well Just an all time classic that never gets oldIt was perfect Game was in great condition sticker on it was great Thanks for being honest Everything was as describe Thanks againI havent opened these I have paperback versions that I use I wanted this as a collectible onlya a aFun gift for gamers because its nostalgic This is for N consoles and it is first person shooter Has multiplayer option but you beat levels playing soloOcarina of Time is one of the best games ever let alone for the N It came pretty quickly plays great after  years and you can easily spend hours on it Every gamer should play it But beware of the text speedThis game was awesome when I was little and owned my original N and its still awesome to this day You just cant outdo a good thing and this game proves itBrings back memories of days long gone by As ive turned from kid to teen from teen to young adult and some day to old man the nostalgia and memory of my childhood in the s becomes ever more appealing to me Back in the days of summer vacations weekends off few worries and fewer obligations and responsibilitiesJust amazing  High quality and all the Zelda feels  Do yourself a favor and get this  A must have in any crazy Zelda fans arsenalBanjoKazooie is a game that didnt really appeal to me at first  It looked to childish to easy and just basically stupid  Comming from the  epic company Rareware I was a bit more interested in what this game was  about  Seeing so many good reviews and so many possitive aspects I  realized I must give this game a try  Well was I ever lucky to do so  Keeping with the Mario  type control style and the amazing graphics I  couldnt put the game down  Even though the game was kiddie looking and  very childish too it was really placed for us people who love adventure  games  The little things such as the mini games make this game even  better than it already was  Imagine running around in the snow in a race  against a sleding polar bear or playing follow the leader with a giant  ghost hand  These are only a few of the things you can do in the game  The game flows a little different than Mario fans might be used to you  have many things to collect  For starters your main objective is to find  all the Jiggys on a level so you can gain access to all other levels  Also music notes are needed to break the witches spell on doors throughout  her lair  And even little guys called Jinjos are here for you to collect  so they can help you on your journey through a forest islands deserts  and many other worlds  If you have seen a Rare game you know that they  have good graphics so no exception here very well done  The music is  also a plus feature on this game  With so many great reviews by people of  all ages and sexes you would be doing yourself a great disjustice by not  buying this gamePlaying this game again after so many years really makes me realize why it is truly one of the greatest games ever Must playfor its time

Going back and replaying this game is weird and fun its fun to see how bad the graphics were and how you didnt see it that way back in the day

considering how easy it is to buy old games this is a must buyI bought this set for my son I am not a gamer so I will state what I know about quality and what my son has shared with me

I was quite impressed with the quality of the books Hard covered gilded edge pages good binding

My son is thrilled with the content Good graphics and he says the information is helpfulGreat game  This was the first Zelda game I ever played and what an adventure it was  If you like your game worlds big with plenty to explore youll love this game  Youll be putting a lot of hours in during your first play through and probably still wont find all thats hidden throughout its worlds  This is a Nintendo masterpiece and easily one of the best games Ive ever playedthis game is so freakin fun especially on player with cheats probably my favorite N game Never loses its replay valueI remember playing multiplayer tournaments on this when I was younger and still play against my son when I canI share a great relationship with this game Before it came out I received a promotional VHS Tape in the mail that told me about the game its stages and gameplay It was a better instruction manual than the booklet I also love how the footage was taken from the beta version of the game With its promotional montage you could tell this was also back when they were going to make Conkers game another cartoony adventure rather than the adultoriented one they ended up making
  Anyway the game is fantastic a perfect supplement to Super Mario  In some ways its actually better When I was a kid I used ALL the cheats to just have fun and explore I played it enough times to  the game in two hours And then when GameFAQs started to be a thing I used the lesserknown cheats to get the ice key and the secret eggs For those who like those old days of collecting stuff this is the game to getthe video game company rareware is the greatest video game company in the universe there true geniuss the best of the best the video game company rareware rocksthe year  and  for rareware are the greatest years for rareware in the universe there perfect years the best of the best the year  and  for rarewre rocks Enjoying playing this game with no complaints Met my expectations and would do business again with this seller againOne of the best games on the Nintendo  and one of the best D Platformers everGreat gift set just as expected a must have for any zelda fan Will keep for ever priced fair tooOca rina of time brings back fond memories my brother  I both beat the game The graphics still hold up well
today and puts present games to shame It may be the greatest videogame ever created who knows You can
freely explore the landscape the difficulty level is just right Theres no need for a strategy guide if youre clever 
smart Zelda even puts the Super Mario games to shame in my opinion I dont have my N any more so Id download
it on my WII VC better than paying those ridiculous prices on Amazon only fools  sheep would pay that much for

Video Game Hall of Fame Zelda influenced the actionrpg genre even to this day Even Sony made a Zelda clone

Thanks for readingI purchased this game after a nostalgia case I had lol and it worked just fine I would buy another if this one failedThese books are much higher quality than the standard release strategy guides  Obviously the books are hardbound allowing them to be more durable but also the pages are printed on lb paper so they are thicker more durable pages than the original magazine releases  The material has also been revised from the original print so they are the most complete and accurate of the guides to date  I just received my guides recently and I have copy number  of   When these are gone Prima has said that they will not be reprinted  They have also released a collectors guide individually for A Link Between Worlds that I grabbed as well  Again the quality of the information inside is excellent as is the quality of these books that will surely become collectors items  Heres hoping they also release books for Majoras Mask when it inevitably releases on the DS as well as the new Zelda adventure for the Wii U later this year or Spring  whenever it is readyThis is game was based on the movie and they hit it spot on Playing the levels are fun but this is the perfect game to play if you are just sitting around with a few friends talkin about the old timesI loved this game and playing it now after all these years its still awesome  Multiplayer on a split screen is still funThis game is so good The dungeons are well thought out and a blast to play This game makes you use your mind and the fighting mechanics are amazingI was worried about getting this but I did anyways because I have been after it for a long time I was worried because it was UsedAcceptable but it has played great so far though I havent gotten very far yet So so far I am so glad I went ahead and ordered itamazing

cool awesome interesting guides of the legend of Zelda

excellent collectors edition item

great for Zelda fans

super coolOne of the games that made n so great had graphics for the time multiplayer all around fun and in my opinion one of the best games of its timewith this game you play through each level in the movie  this is when James Bond was James Bond  you can choose from a whole list of players to choose from to play as  you can get any kind of weapon just about through the whole game  and you can even play with some friends on missions  if you have never played a n what are you waiting for   out of   super funSuch a good gift This is for N and makes a great gift for gamers Super nostalgic and fun game Complicated and timeconsuming but a lot of funOne of the best video games ever

Redefined everything after it

My copy came in very good condition without scratches or writingLove this game Although the graphics arent the best since its N and earlier on I enjoy everything about it still keeping in mind the limitations of the time such as the invisible walls and oddly prism shaped bottles etc The story is well done and unlike other Zelda games all of the items are used There were some early on copies with a songchanting in the fire temple that got taken out in later copies because some people got offended by that and the mirror shield I have one such copy but even with that in mind its still an amazing game with great music and it sort of ties all of the zelda games together like a central hub It all comes down to this game definitely worth your time to playI already have all the Zelda Collectors edition guides but I decided to purchase this as well just to add to my collection Everything is so great in this little box I recommend it to any fan that either missed out the first time or if youre a collector since they come with specially marked numbersThis game is totally mind blowing so many areas to cover hours of play and has awesome amazing graphics and so much more to conquer Stars Buy this game It worth the moneyI LOVE THIS GAME It is so funny and a bit hard to beat The hardest level is in the temple where a shuttle is launching and you have to collect data kill Jaws get launch tape and launch the shuttle My favorite level is the Facility Level That level is so funny and you can shoot the scientists but it will fail the mission if they were killed My cousin and I love to blow up the enemies and scientists My favorite is shooting the scientists and enemies in their butts and they would jump up and down rubbing their butts and then they will fight back and the scientists will threw grenades at you The controls are easy and this game is better and funnier than the movie BUY THIS GAMEThe multiplayer is amazing but most reviews already cover that I still have yet to beat the last level Cradle and the  bonus missions on the hardest difficulty after  years and yet I am addicted to trying over and over I finished the Campaign twice on the st  difficulties Each difficulty higher the more parts of the level you explore and the more crazy scenarios you will experience places and scenarios that you did not experience in the easier difficulties Many missions you can go about using stealth or guns blazing It is always fun trying to beat facility or Bunker  with just a silenced pp without alerting anyone Nothing is more satisfying than shooting  gaurds to death with a silenced ppk before they can hit the alarm In some levels if you are feeling arrogant you can hit the alarm yourself and take on hundreds of enemies and go rambo There is so much about this game I could go on for days about how amazing this game is No modern AAA FPS has surpassed Goldeneye on N campaign to this day The remakes have been complete crap despite the amazing COD engine If you own a N and love perfect dark or other great FPS adventures you will love thisI remembered a time my older brother borrowed this game from a friend of his I liked it so much but when it came to the time for my brother to give it back i was upset But no worries I was  at the time when that happened now that Im older i was able to buy my own copyThe game looked brand new even though it was used It worked perfectly Super happy I got to have one of my childhood favorite games nowThe best game for the N if you are to have  games for the system it needs to be Mario  Mario Kart Smash Bros Banjo Kazooie and Zeldahe loves zelda and loves anything that has to do with zelda so anything will make him happy he loved the box it came in to Also the packaging was really good and sturdyWhat can I say about this game I bought it to replace one that was stolen when I was a kid Its great to hear those classic sound effects and that legendary music EPICAn anthropomorphic bear and a cheeky bird save his bear sister from a witch who wants to suck out her sexiness and use it to give herself a boobnose job FiveStarsThe cartridge was clean and worked perfectly Loved this game as a child and even more so now as a young adultIn the year  Goldeneye was released for the Nintendo  by Rare an unknown company and new nd party developer Rare had already made several games for the NES and enters the Nintendo  market with this release based on the classic James Bond movie of the same title You can ask anyone who had a Nintendo  if they ever played this game and why it was so popular Youre guaranteed to hear  reasons in particular why this game is so revered

REASON  This game is a prime example of how a developer took its time to make this game It was more than  years since the movie it was based on came out and Rare had access to everything concerning the movie from the original orchestral music likeness of the main characters and locations to the bonus villains of other James Bond movies such as Oddjob and Mayday They didnt rush this out the door like some developers do when they wanted their games released alongside the films it was based on and it always guaranteed to be a huge mistake This game was a huge success and is still played by many video gamers

REASON  Nintendo had no idea that the multiplayer section of this game would be just as popular to play in or more popular than the single player mode Rare admitted in an interview after the game was released that they had no intentions of putting together a multiplayer mode until later in its development stages Though it may be limited by todays standards you had the basics several stages based on the single player mode all of the weapons were available all of the main characters plus the enemy soldiers and classic Bond villains and several game modes such as free for all death match team death match you only live twice  lives etc and you can select the weapons in group categories along with time limits per match This added a lot of replayability after you finished the single player mode

If you dont have a Nintendo  this game is reason enough to get it This game helped Nintendo sell so many systems and it is a title I highly recommend getting if you can find it Its a great game to play by yourself and an absolute blast to play with  of your friends Peace GoldenEye  was simply the greatest game ever made No if ands or buts This game stood out from the rest giving itself the title of the almighty master of the game world My Uncle Steve was the first person to tell me about the game in  and told me I had to get Goldeneye and told me Its the best game he ever played and he only had a Playstaion at the time I played this game when it first game out I was  years old and Im now  and still love it to the death GoldenEye set the standards for every FPS that has followedAwesome controls greta levels killer music loads of cool guns and awesome James Bond  The perfect shooter  Played this one a loti played this game when i was about  and im now  and still love it to the death literally I have a blast shooting other things other than just people and watching bullet holes go into the items and how it looks so freaking real I also have always loved how you can choose many different people in  player mode such as  to scientist The golden gun is the coolest because it only takes on shot to kill but if you like a really smashing good time you can always punch or cut your way out A must have game for the  Goldeneye set the standards for every FPS that has followed It is the best of the best The levels are action packed and extremely memorable I can do the levels in my head Ive played them so many times The graphics are dull now but back in the day these visuals were top notch The music involves some of the best techno Ive ever heard The game is also surprisingly difficult I took me ten years to beat all the difficulty levels The multiplayer is ahead of its time with four player large arena style deathmatches This game should be missed by no one pick up a copy today and first hand see the best

Presentation This game captures what it is to be James Bond There are a great deal of weapons cool menus and music that still rocks to this day All around a great feeling game the blood rolling down the screen after you die is epic 

Story The game follows the story of Goldeneye pretty closely and there are two bonus levels that follow other Bond movies Including one of the hardest levels of all time the Aztec based on the movie Moonraker 

Graphics This game looked amazing for its day now it may be unimpressing but remember what the world of N looked liked 

Game play This is the part that could be helped by a remake The N controller only has one joystick This is awkward sometimes but the use of the cpad to strafe helps Nintendo please remake this amazing gem 

Sound Some of the best music in a video game ever made Catchy music that I even have on my Ipod to this day 

Lasting Appeal I still play this game regularly when the current generation games anger me I can play levels in my head need I say more This game will never be forgotten or equaled 

Rating I am a Zelda fan and I am absolutely delighted to add this to my collection Any die hard Zelda fan would and should add this to their collection as wellWhat can be said about Ocarina of Time I still remember that commercial from the late s It told us that a dark time is approaching My interest was piqued Then I realized it was a Zelda game As a huge fan of A Link to the Past I thought ZOMG that looks awesome I need to get this more than Ive ever needed to get anything I remember reading about it in GamePro and obviously being interested but that commercial sealed the deal I knew I had to have Ocarina of Time and that Christmas my mom got it for me Cheers

A lot has been said about OoT over the years It has been referred to as the Best Game of All Time by some and the Most Overrated Game of All Time by others Im not really in either camp but I lean closer to the former group I suppose If you havent played it yet you should Its out on a variety of platforms and theres even remake of it with better graphics but I would still recommend the N version if you want the same experience people had back in the s when OoT was THE GAME you needed to play

Story

You are Link The Great Deku Tree guardian of the forest in which you live has summoned you Its revealed that you must visit a far off castle and meet a Princess of Destiny and doing so brings you square into a struggle for the fate of Hyrule  nay the world  itself

Gameplay

To complete your quest and save Hyrule you must boldly enter into many dungeons which are filled with fierce skeletal warriors humansized spiders horrible ghosts and immobile venus fly traps Completing a dungeon gives you an item for the main quest and completing all of the dungeons will allow you to face the final boss Theres much more to it that but Im trying not to spoil storyline specifics for those who havent played it

Hyrule is a vast world One of your ingame guides tells you that You can go wherever you want Thats true to a point Theres a lot of exploration in Ocarina of Time The game is always trying to point you toward a certain place but whether or not you go there is often up to you In an interactive world such as Hyrule you can do many things Why go see whats on Death Mountain when you could pour water into all of the soil patches in Hyrule Or why go play the Shadow Temple  which does not have any attractive Gerudo women  when you could go to the Spirit Temple which does The exploration is one of OoTs best features and its probably better than any Zelda which came after it

Controls

They work well enough You dont have the full on camera control that some of the later Zelda games give you but personally I never found it all that essential to the process

Ocarina of Time introduced a Ztargeting system for aiming at enemies and talking to nonplayable characters What you do is get near an enemyNPC press or hold Z and then press a button to talk to themattack them The system pretty intuitive and well made so much so that its successors have yet to really improve upon it

Music

s gripe Where is the classic Zelda overworld theme Oh we can hear it for like five seconds in the Hyrule Field theme ARE YOU SERIOUS But seriously the music is pretty good The Hyrule Field theme which I just mentioned is a good theme The music does a good job of fitting the areas which you visit for the most part

Some later Zelda games use too much ambient music in the dungeons OoT is guilty of this too but only to a small degree Apart from the Water Temples melody theres nothing that makes me want to relax and do some meditation or whatever while hearing it P

Oh and Im sad to report that the OoT Commercial Music is not in this game 

Replay Value

Its pretty massive You can do some Temples in different orders than you did your first time through or you can use different items to progress through the Temples I summed it up in a sentence but theres hundreds of hours of replay potential there in just finding all of OoTs possible variations

Like in the original Legend of Zelda you can do the Three Heart Challenge which means you can complete the game without any of the health upgrades from beating a dungeon Essentially thats playing Hard Mode although it isnt really that hard

But if the Three Heart Challenge wasnt enough OoT lets you tack on additional stipulations to make replaying it even harder There are technically unnecessary items which let you breathe underwater and resist intense heat Not getting them limits the amount of time you can spend in relevant areas On top of all that you could even as far to skip the health upgrades which halve your damage



If you call yourself a gamer and have not played Ocarina of Time what are you Some undercover nongamer sent in to infiltrate us Go play it nowSeriously As awesome as the games before and after this game are there is truly NO touching OOT The story is amazing and well thought out the game play is simple the music is suburb and all console Zelda games stem from this right here SUCH as excellent game There is no surprise many gaming magazines regard OOT as the greatest Zelda game or Video Gameof all timeVery fun game to play and has an excellent story line to play Lots of different equipment to use and the game isnt overly difficult to beatIts ocarina of time I just wanted to get it for my fiancee for christmas because she loves the gameThis is one of the most creative and original games I have ever played The level design collecting elements and excellent graphics paired with a topnotch soundtrack by Grant Kirkhope makes for an amazing platformerGoldenEye  is not only the best movie tiein game of all time but it is perhaps the most influential firstperson shooter ever to hit the gamingconsole market  If you arent aware of the plot of this game thats not a problem because essential it is the same as the popular James Bond movie GoldenEye which was released in  two years prior to this games release

This is a game that is filled with techniques and styles that would be mimicked in many future games to come and it gives the player a wide variety of objectives and difficult challenges  The AI is smart especially on higher difficulty settings and the environments are complex enough to provide entertainment as well as difficulty to any gamer

The introduction of logical hitpoints on your enemies is a great feature  Even bosses in this game can be taken down with a wellaimed shot to the head  It is this type of realism that really makes you feel like your James Bond and that you can sneak in sneak out covertly taking out henchmen as you go or springing alarms and having to go through massive shootouts  Because of this there are many ways to beat the game and limitless possibilities for how you accomplish your tasks  AKA You can take easy ways or hard ways of beating levelsand if you dont have a strategy guide youll have to find out those paths by yourself which I might add is incredibly fun if you want to waste a day away

This is one of those games that the more you play it the more youre able to value its contributions to the gaming industry  Each time I play it I notice aspects that have been replicated in many following FPS games  So if you have a Nintendo  go ahead and dust that sucker and order a used copy of GoldenEye  because trust me as a Bond fan and a casual gamer I can say that this game is highly recommended for all those who want to step into the shoes of James Bond or just have an awesome intense gaming experience

Also make sure to look out for its sister game Perfect Dark which is also on the N following the same controls and very similar weapon usesOne of the best games of all time
You get the thrill of beating all the bosses playing the ocarina and riding Epona around Hyrule Never going to regret getting this game One of my favoritesWhen I first got my Gamecube this game was part of the Zelda collectors edition I didnt know much about Zelda and had only played very few games before but was mesmerized by this game The beginning of it is so magical and imaginative it really draws you in to the story I found myself playing through the beginning of it over and over again because I didnt have my memory card yet This game takes place in a vivid fantasy world that is vibrant ominous beautiful and haunting I had never experienced anything like it To this day I have never been so absorbed by another game

Whats really impressive is that this whole game is very consistent The music is also exceptional The music is better than most movie soundtracks in my opinion All of it perfectly accompanies what is happening in the game So much happens in this game it has a lot of cinematic scenes too which really develop the story which is an excellent tale of good versus evil

Ocarina of Time stimulated my imagination at a young age more than just about anything I know of There are a few films and books that would come close but I cant think of anything that could quite surpass it Ocarina of Time is an involving authentic scary and epic adventure Playing it for the first time makes for an unparalleled experienceThe game came two days early and is a great game The controls are nice Gruntilda is enormously entertaining and you can easily spend hours on itBanjo Kazooie is undoubtedly one of the most greatest ActionAdventure Platform video games of all time Please dont stop selling N games like this and others This game reminds me of when I was only a toddler now a teenager I LOVE IT MORE Banjo Kazooie has NOSTALGIA written all over it Keep it coming yall Glad that the majority of N games are all CLEAN No Bloodshed and gore THXThis game is without a doubt my favorite game ever I must have beat it  times When I finish it it always makes me sad but then I start it over and it makes me happy again The NutsandBolts version for  is nothing compared to the N version A must haveHarder than I remember But still fun to break out and play when feeling nostalgicI have fond memories of this game and still get together to play it with friends
Before GoldenEye first person shooters were primarily PC affairs played with a keyboard and mouse and multiplayer required either internet or network capabilities which at the time I didnt have GoldenEye changed this Just like Mario Kart you could get four players hooked in Except instead of bumping Bowser off a race track you were running around and laying down the heat as Bond or one of his alliesantagonists There are plenty of modes arenas and weapons to choose from ranging from deathmatch to flag tag And once in a while you have to play with slappers only

In addition to the Multiplayer aspects it has an excellent SinglePlayer mode Its mission objective based meaning that failure is entirely possible and as difficulty increases so do the number of objectives and conditions you have to fulfill

The music is also notable Sure its entirely synhtesizedMIDI but in those days that was the state of the art The music fits the scenes pretty well mostly being varied riffs on the classic John Barry Bond theme some being a little different

The game contains a nice variety of weapons and plenty of secrets to unlock  by speedrunning levels while fulfilling all objectives

Whether youve never played this classic or youre looking back on the good old days you should play it This
is Rares N Masterwork  Perfect Dark is pretty sweet tooI am a major player of  games I have played nearly every single one but I have to say GoldenEye is one of the best that there is even years and platforms later Even though I have a GameCube with all of the other  games I still to this day find myself returning to play a round of Goldeneye

GoldenEye has a great plotline in my opinion even better than the movie and long missions which allow a lot of replay value The graphics are a bit blurry but that is to be expected in an N FPS

Overall I love this game and would reccomend it to any  fanAs a big Zelda fan this treasure chest is magnificent and since I own all of these games it was a no brainer for me As ive gotten older its been harder to enjoy Zelda games because of their vastness and depth so i was really happy to see that now i dont have to worry about missing something in each game because now i have a gorgeous guide for each game from the last decade The golden bookmark is is beautiful and the chest looks like its from Wind Waker The guides are printed as top class books that look luxurious and are marvelous to read through If you love LoZ and own these games get this before theyre goneI bought this game thinking it would be pretty cool and that i might play it for a  week or two and be done  Boy was I wrong From the moment I finally got the gamed Fired up the other commentors on this are right it takes forever and u are forced to create an account I watched as it booted up I could tell right off the bat that ALOT of thought went into making this game If you have ever played Sim city then this game is a must try as you will easily navigate thru it and its multi layers I have been playing htis now for a month straight and I am STILL discovering layers of complexity in the game There are a few things in the game that could used tweaked but all in all this is a  star gameLord

It has been too darn long since I last played this master piece

The single player mode is too much fun But the  of the credit goes to the multi game mode

Great selection of weapons nice variety of levels Huge list of characters to choose from from the original bond movies fun options while playing Bobble head characters paint ball shooting marks

I am telling you the game was the center of attention with friends Large gatherings challenges playing till the break of dawn I will give the game credit from keeping us off the streets  

I dont know if I can find this game but boy if you can Find three friends and Play it without mercy

All the best

NawafVery good FPS game although multiplayer mode does lag Highly recommend for your N collection This one is a classicWhen I purchased this game the graphics were obviously amazing with the new nintendo  I used to play this hours on end doing the single player missions over and over and also having some friends over to play multiplayer After the playstation  came out I pushed the nintendo  over for a few weeks but I found my self slowly returning to some goldeneye along with a few other great nintendo  games

Now that I have a  I rarely play goldeneye anymore But with the recent purchase of a n i have again found myself playing goldeneye with all the wonderful fun cheats that it offers This game changed the way we play games totally It is still one of the best games I own right next to the newest xbox  gamesThis is one of my favorite FPSs of all time It stands right alongside Halo and Battlefield  The single player missions are done wonderfully the enviroments are great and the multiplayer is the best I have ever played

BUY THISAnother Rareware CLASSIC  The game that defines st person shooter Like the title says Rare did it Best  I love the PC shooters like Doom Quake  Duke Nukem  But  did it   The first of its kindperfect d graphics   control  And the first game to do stealth right  You can sneak through levels stealth with your silenced pistol or go all out nuts with the AK  This model of game would go on to influence ALL future fps  PS  xbox fanboys take notice  If rare hadnt come up with this formula Modern Warfare  Halo wouldnt exist as they areCame packaged amazingly so that the collector box did not dent or anything
I do not mind that the cloth maps were not in the books since Ive heard that the quality for them were not that great
The bookmark and certificate all make up for it also the chest the items came in
For  this is a bargain The books separately are at least  each
This is a perfect LoZ collectors itemGoldeneye  on the now obsolete Ninetndo  is still to this day my favourite game of all time Before the Nintendo  arrived i was a massive Sega fan nothing anyone said could put me off my Sega obsession And then i played Mario  and everything changed I went out and swapped my Sega Saturn and all its games for a brand new Nintendo  and a second hand copy of Mario  and i never looked back Then allmost a year later Goldeneye  arrived and introduced me to a whole new genre You see before Goldeneye i had never played a first person shooter so it was all new to me I also happened to be a huge James Bond fan at the time so i was quite excited about playing this for the first time and i was not dissapointed Everything about this game just worked so well it had the right feel a bond game should have It was also one of the most addictive multiplayer games ever Me and me mates would spend hours playing this game The weapons are some of the best ever in a first person shotter The snipper riffle in particular was awsome to use and the tank levels were so much fun Since Goldeneye there been some trully amazing shooters including the brilliant HalfLife but for some reason i have yet to play a game that has that same magic as Rares wonderful game If you havent played this yet then you dont know what youre missingI really should have the kids writing this I think they liked this game but yet there was something lacking in all the zelda gamesI loved this game as a kid but my older brother took it with him when he moved out  It works perfectly and arrived in due time  I was worried ordering a used game because some Id ordered from places in the past havent worked but have absolutely no complaints

For any who want a review of the game itself
Of all the games we played growing up this one stood out due to its creativity and its soundtrack  I love the variation in the worlds from wandering the beaches of Treasure Trove Cove to the snowy winter wonderland of Freezeezy Peak  The characters are fun and the violence is very childfriendly  My mom enjoyed listening to us play it enough she went out and bought the soundtrack so she could listen on her own
Hats off to the makers of this game because the level of creativity and imagination that went into it was outstandingThis is one of the best racing games ever created it inspired a generation of great racing games Youll have so much fun playing this God I get tried if writing reviews I just want to buy a product and go on with my life
Sorry
DavidThis is one of the coolest box sets Ive ever purchased I like the minimalism of the books themselves Hylian crest and gold embellishments around the borders different color for each game titles on spine They simply look amazing The chest box is pretty cool too but Im not as impressed with it since I generally prefer to display books in the traditional upright position on a bookshelf But its a great tiein to the games since opening chests is always something you associate with Zelda games

My only regrets are paying extremely high prices for individual newsealed guides a year ago before this set was announced I paid closer to  to get them all brand new on eBay This set will surely devalue my existing ones since Im planning on now reselling them But I had to get this set since it included the OoT D guide that you cant get separately

I really dont get why they would release this set so close to the guide for A Link Between Worlds Did no one have the foresight to either include a blank spot for the new guide or actually include the new guide in this set In a way it makes the set feel instantly out of date right at release But oh well not that big of a deal I will be purchasing that one separately before it also becomes sold out everywhere and triples in price like Twilight Princess didThis is one of my all time favorite games The characters are likeable with hilarious dialogue and an intriguing story Also the music is some of the best Ive ever heard in a video game Also the graphics and sound are great for N The controls are CRAZY precise for N and MAN is this game challenging There are lots of secrets to uncover and special power ups to unlock If only Microsoft hadnt ruined RareThis game is a keeper to have and I wouldnt mind playing another James Bond game which Im getting From Russia with Love And that means there will be more fights to the end I just keep playing this game over againYeah this is one of the classics that blew away everyone N MAGAZINES got better because of it and bonded friends and family for years on end There was no other game like it Empire magazine started writing better games reviews because of it This was a mental good multiplayer in  We all played this side by side for years I cant say I have played anything quite like it since Golden Eye N Yeah those where the days I remember this left Playstation  owners in aweThis is the best shoot em up on the N I was very impressed with the game play the graphics the action the multi player fun everything the only downfall about the game is I wanted more more more The cheats are great when you unlock them and the best thing is you dont need a memory card everything saves on the cartridge RARE actualy managed to compress a game that was too big for the N into this game somehow and it suprises me that it does not even use the N Expansion pack to do that This game is not just hoursand hours of fun but days weeks years  i still play this cool game even todayGolden Eye is widely considered one of the best FPS ever made It is a great solid game and I recommend this game to everybodyBeing the third major installment of the all time great CC seris tiberian sun was released in  with enormous anticipation and fanfare Unforunately the game didnt seem to live up to the hype but looking back today a few years later tiberian has stood the test as a fine solid game and now that it is basically at a bargain bin price i certainly think its worth a look even for those who already own red alert  The main difference that i see between TS and RA is the look Where the characters in RA are a bit too large the ones in TS may be a bit too small RA has a more straight forward look much like ra were Ts has that cool golden dusk look Since TS is a fantasy sci fi game almost anything goes where RA is based on more conventional warfare That extra room for creative activity helps make TS a fun game One example is the hunter seeker feature were you can create a drone attached to an explosive This drone will take off on its own and randomly attach itself and destroy an enemy unit or structure You must have this feature because your opponent will Another feature i like is the component towers were you make the towers early and later buy the defensive attachment Theres a vulcan cannon for fighting infantry the grenade launcher and the anti air sam
The concept for TS is the good guys global defense initiativeGDI vs the religious brotherhood of the nod a fanatical terrorist group Sounds familiar Certainly a concept appropriate for today but the NOD is the military equal to the GDI Both sides are distinctive and different The GDI is more muscular and has more fire power while the nod relies on stealth and sneaky tactics Strategy is far more important here than just cranking out more tanks than your opponent For example the nod has an apc that can burrow under ground Pack the thing full of infantry or engineers and sneak into the middle of an opponents camp underground only to resurface unleashing the attack The gdi has ways to counter this however A mobile sensor can be built that will detect the apc on radar and concrete can be placed down so the unit cant resurface in vulnerable areas of your camp Some new features that differ from the original CC and RA A single engineer can take over an opponents building infantry cant just be run over by vehicles and you have the deployable mcv feature that allows you to pack up your command center and move it
Some other pros
Being a  game it doesnt require much computer
Almost always runs smoothly
Still a fairly vibrant online community with plenty of opponents to play
Cheap Only  or  if you also want the firestorm pack
Very colorful and pleasant to look at Graphics still look good compared to games that were released a couple of years later
A  minute patch update that can be downloaded from the game
A seemingly unlimited number of free mods that can be dowloaded off the internet
The opportunity to make expensive powerful units like the mammoth tank
There are a few negatives about the game No naval units at all even though you have these really cool looking rivers And a limited air force Orca helicopters are pretty cool but thats it Most mods are too extreme and change the game too much and there are very few maps you can download No coop play
Over all this is a fun game with the opportunity to change through mods The graphics are cool and strategy is more important than with the prior CC releases Worth about  stars but at this price it gets 
socks one of the best games ever released on any console The storyline is amazing it captivates you swiftly The gameplay is also awesome and the graphics evil bosses etc its just one of the best games in the market At some point we all wished to become Link play a tune or two with an Occarina and may day turn into night or draw towards you a horse named Eponathis is a great price on this set the treasure chest is a great addiiton they are limited to k so buy it upThis was my second visit with Zelda after the original NES game Wow This game was SO ahead of its time in graphics gameplay story everything Seriously ground breaking stuff for when this game was released Ive played this game off and on for most of my life first getting it around the time it was released

Its proven to age VERY well and is fun decades after first discovering it A genre defining game in a class all of its own If you havent played this game get itThis game is one of the finest Video games ever produced while its graphics may be some what dated by todays standards its epic story and play control are arguably better than many of todays titles

I cannot recommend this game enoughThe game that really started it all for me in the D genre What an amazing racer for the NThis is one of the best games out there its a classic BanjoKazooie is one of the rarest and hard to find games ever The story is really good A witch kidnaps a beautiful girl and wants to be the prettiest of them all Her brother and his pal Kazooie have to save her While its a relatively easy it can still be hard in some places and there are cheat codes to help you along the way with things like Gold feathers Red feathers and Eggs However if you quit and save your game then the cheat has to be reentered While the game does have its flaws its still really fun to play The game essentially is very easy next to its sequel game Banjo Tooie The levels all relatively easy however it is very easy to die in this game on top of that like other reviewers on Amazon have said about dying and losing notes and recollecting them is toldly true Clarkers Cavern was the worst because you only have  things of air and have to get extra air from a fish blowing bubbles The level that is the most challenging of them all was Click Clock Wood Because of going from the changing seasons and having to grab notes from all seasons that was tough for me However the most challenging and difficult part of this game is beating Grunty herself That is the most challenging part of this game because you have to hit her with eggs and unfortunately its a huge flaw on Rares part for not putting a homing shooter like they do in the sequel game Overall despite its many flaws Nintendo and Rare have done an excellent job making a game that is graphically pleasing and the gameplay is awesome Buy it you wont regret itOMGosh     My son  grandson  and greatgrandson   all three are totally enjoying this game soooooo much  Im not any kind of a game player but it makes me feel so good just watching their enjoyment  Thank you for a product that is not full of all that blood and gore that so many of the games have now daysLoved it One of the best games in this genre Good story and even has the guy from the first Terminator who protects the woman cant think of his name as one of the main actors in the cutscenes and James Earl Jones High production values  The game play is top notchI am writing this review from what i thought of it before red alert  came out  this is a great game with a pretty good story line though it lacks graphics  Westwood online the multiplayer sever is also very good  if your lookign to buy a good RTS i recomend red alert  but if you dont want to spend the money on RA this is still a great gameThis is this is the first strategy game I have ever liked that I played so maybe Im partial to it  but I love it  I dont understand why some  people are so crushed when their favorite game series puts out  a bad game  Its not that big of a deal  For all you Red Alert buffs Red  Alert  will be out soon so chill out for a minute  There are a ton of  different strategies to play this game with so it becomes extremely  addictive  Once you get the basics down  the sky is pretty much the  limit on strategies you can use so this adds replay value to the game  It  will definitely keep you busy until the next installment by Westwood  The  online play is great and easy to use  I havent even played the single  player game because I just cant get enough of the online play  So unlike  the other people who are saying they hate it but they probably still play  it often I like it an awful lotWell it seems that those idiots who gave TS a low rating was because they  thought TS reused Red Alerts units That is completely wrong  TS is set in  a futuristic world with advanced units Red Alert was a PREQUEL to the  original CC and was set throughout the Cold War TS does not use  standard tanks and the new units were made as it would have been seen in  the year TS took place which was  This is especially true with GDI and  there titans disruptors firestrom defense rpg towers MMK II and a whole  lot more Nod has has the cyborgs underground units and and the banshee  aircraft etc Now are these the same units from RA i dont think so  Westwood retained a couple of units from the original CC such as the  devils tougue and light tank but they upgraded the functions of these  units to please gamers Nothing from this game was copied from RA trust  me As for Starcraft some say its better than TS and some say it isnt I  personally hate that game Its way more complex to understand than TS  simple interface no deformidable terrain you have to RIGHT CLICK to  deselect units very awkward structures take extremely long to build  as  well as units those same structures look like they have legsterran  barracks and engineering bay I also have no idea what the storyline is  about no real actors  jus  bad FMVsI could name a whole lot more but it  would take up too much space in this review The only single thing i like  is the marine responses which give u a good laugh now and then but it still  gets repetitive after a while which is common in almost all RTS games  Sure Starcraft is an original game with new features that pleases people  just like the old CC some people ask for too much in a sequel and  when they find what they havent been looking for they disgrace the game  Well see what sequel is in store for Starcraft but for now if youre a  serious fan of CCs then pick up a copy of TS youll find an  intersting game with a whole bunch of new features including some old time  favs that would have rememberedThis game along with Mario  and Donkey Kong  basically use the same basic style with different characters They are are a blast even now though it takes playing it now to realize how clumsy the camera system on these games was I dont know how I managed to get all the notes while playing on the N I find it next to impossible now to have the patience to navigate some of the last levels with the slowness and precision needed to prevent falling off a cliff and having to spend  minutes getting back up or worse dying in which case you lose all your notes in the level and have to collect them from scratch  Thus I  quicksave often

I guess I no longer am as good as I once was at these games  Still this is one of my N favorites from my high school years basicallyTiberian sun is an example of how a real time game should be  Great campains where you can be either Nod or GDI  This game also has great skrimishes  Where you can play the computer on a diffrent level of  difficulty and can play anwhere from  enimies  With alot of diffrent  units and buildings this game is not to be missedOne of the best games on the N it combines action adventure puzzle and other elements as you go through awsome based levels to beat itThis is most likely one of the best N Games Ever made Its way better then Super mario  in everyway and possibly Zelda too its rich colorful and very addicting The soundtracks are also one of my favorite things about the game it has a happy and also very awesome tune to them making them addictive you just cant stop listening to it and the world designs  total I believe are all very Beautiful and Gorgeous Ive beaten the game to  and I still go back to the worlds and gaze in thier amazement its just really cool this game is a MUST HAVE for any Nintendo  player Im serious if you dont have this your missing out BIG time

PS check out its Sequel BanjoTooie after youve bought thisIve never really had enough of an attention span to play collect the item games but this particular one is really great It has enough action and puzzle involved to hold the attention of even a gamer like me with honestly and unfortunately a terribly short attention span for hours at a time with enough elements of finding things youll need later to keep you playing and replaying each level A truly great game and I wish more of the sort were made these days I feel way too young to be saying this but they just dont make them like this anymore
On a side note the cartridge I received has some Interesting connections Id guess the previous owner loved and played it as much as I do hahaGoldeneye  Killer Instint The Donkey Kong Country series Conker Diddy Kong Racingthose were the good ol days when Rare was still relevant  Before they sold their souls to Microsoft and lost all credibility  And in my opinion the peak of Rare was with the Banjo games kazooie  tooie on Nintendo   Kazooie to me defines the N D platformer  While many will say Mario  which is a near perfect game  I think the Nostalgia sometimes forgets how much BETTER Banjo Kazooie was  Back in  rare was on a roll  This game was yet another grandslam  A brand new franchise cut from scratch  And its absolutely amazing  I wont go into all the details and story as my fellow reviewers have already made clear  All I can add is this game is easily one of the best games of the late s  It was a game I picked up and loved immediately  My only question is WHAT the  happened to rare  They were so amazing with Nintendo then dropped bomb after bomb for the XBox consoles  Im not a Nintendo fanboy so dont even go there  But Rare took a big dookie all over this series with the newer games on Microsoft consoles  The  game will always be the best  And I hope someday the brothers who originally ran Rare will comeback to bring the infamous Banjo Threeie to life on any consoleThis game is fantastic Personally I love it Have you ever played a game where an evil witch is ugly and wants to be evil so she steals a beautiful girl named Tooty to try and transfer the beauty to the ugly witch Also have you ever played a game where a bear and bird have to collect golden puzzle pieces musical notes dinosaurs mixed with teddy bears named Jinjos Also have you ever played a game where a shaman transforms the bear and bird into various forms Well if you havent this is where to start This game is perfect for all ages I would recommend this game to anyone who has a NIf Mario  was good than Banjo was Mario perfected
Amazing game
Another gem from years ago that I played start to finish multiple times
Amazing levels
Perfect control
Great but hokey music

Some people were annoyed by the voices
I thought they were hilarious
The camera does get a little crazy here and there but this was D platforming in its beginning and really the camera is about as perfect as a D platforming camera can be

To summarize
Great gameplay
Awesome graphics for the time
An ending riddle that had me looking for a way in for weeks on end
A real bummer that the two games DIDNT link after all
Thats probably the biggest disappointment that all those mystery areas were never revealed by the N
Otherwiseanother great platformer from the golden age of platforming collect a thons
Highly recommendedRare just has an extraordinary knack at making great games Banjo Kazooie was released in  and has been considered a classic since and I too must agree with this well deserved honor Well why do I find this game fantastic Well Ill explain that in my review

First off lets talk about Banjo Kazooies story Banjos sister Tooty is kidnapped by the wicked witch Gruntilda Gruntilda has planned on swapping Tootys beauty to her but not if Banjo and his friend Kazooie can help it Okay seriously this story is pretty lame but hey Its a game In My opinion no matter how good the graphics are or how great the story is it all boils down to one thing And thats gameplay And Banjo Kazooie has fantastic gameplay

In Banjo Kazooie you play as Banjo andwellKazooie and Kazooie stays inside Banjos backpack at all times but shes not useless They both work as a team and learn many moves which brings us to our next character Bottles Bottles the mole helps you learn different moves to help you defeat Gruntilda and rescue Tooty But do you just walk up to Gruntilda and save Tooty Not at all there are several items to collect to defeat Gruntilda The most important one is jiggies there are ten jiggies in each world and you need several items to collect them Along the way Bottles teaches you to use certain items such as eggs to shoot through Kazooies mouth or how to fly when you collect enough feathers Another essential item to collect is mumbo tokens Gruntilda has hidden mumbo tokens all around her enormous lair and if you collect enough you can visit the great shaman Mumbo Jumbo and he will transform you into different creatures to help you along your journey So you have plenty to do in this game I can guarantee that Another essential item are music notes in each world one hundred music notes are scattered all around and if you collect enough you can open new doors in Gruntildas massive lair But I do find it to become quite tedious sometimes Why You may ask Because each time you leave and reenter a world all the notes are still there no matter how many youve collected Lets say youve collected ninetynine out of the hundred possible music notes to collect well if you leave the world and reenter you would have to collect all ninety nine notes again you couldnt go searching for the one music note you hadnt collected And while yet this situation is highly unlikely its still annoying no matter how many notes you have to recollect Fortunately if you dont care about collecting all one hundred music notes you dont have to because the game automatically saves the amount youve collected

There arent too many moves to learn in Banjo Kazooie and it didnt take me long to master them And there arent many control problems actually the controls are almost perfect But I did get frustrated with a feature that was not added in the game I wish Banjo could hang on to ledges there was many times in Clankers Cavern where I could almost reach a ledge  but it was just barely out of reach because I couldnt hang on to the ledge While yet this wasnt too big of a deal I think that feature could of made the game a little less frustrating I was also very pleased with camera control there are three angles to choose from except in a few rare areas and I found it easy to maneuver

I told you this game was made in  right Well the graphics are terrific The different atmospheres to this game make it twice more enjoyable You can relax in broad daylight in Treasure Trove Cove or wonder at dark in Mad Monster Mansion And I thought the last world Click Clock Wood was absolutely brilliant its a forest and you collect jiggies in the four seasons spring summer fall and winter I especially loved Freezeezy Peak and it was so much fun climbing the huge snowman

I also loved the music in this game each beat is catchy and it never got repetitive for me and the sound effects were great as wellwell the only complaint I could have is that there is no dialogue in the game but I actually found the weird sounds from the characters kind of funny and I loved the insults between Kazooie and Bottles and Gruntildas rhymes cracked me up thats another reason I love this game it has such a charm to it not like some newer games to many games have steered away from being innocent and charming and this game has this quality

What more can I say This game is fun to play it has great replay value the music sounds and the worlds all sound and look absolutely fantastic and the difficult final fight with Gruntilda at the end was indeed terrific as well It took me thirty hours to complete without a guide and I had so much fun solving puzzles and this game can test your mind at certain times I will admit I did need help online for a few jiggies but the ending sequence makes the occasional frustrations all worthwhile very satisfying if you ask me Im now very anxious to play Banjo Tooie as its been claimed to be even better than the original Banjo Kazooie is highly recommended this game is indeed a classicPositive
 gameplay is very deep with new elements added all the time
 worlds are very diverse and have a lot of content
 music tracks are great and change in style when youre in different spots
 sharp controls that work well for the most part

Negative
 you have to start your note count every time you reenter a world
 camera doesnt always give you the best view you need

Super Mario  revolutionized the D platformer and the amount of people who would deny that are probably fewer than the words in this sentence But when a revolution comes whats the point of it being so revolutionary unless something comes of it later on In video games a game is a revolution indeed when other games take the basic model and take it to a whole new level and possibly delivering a game thats even better than the root Whether it really is a beneficiary of the beloved Mario  or Rare is just really really good at making games that is where we find BanjoKazooie

Games of the platforming genre arent exactly known for their amazing stories and Banjo fares no different Banjos little sister Tooty is kidnapped by the stereotypical green witch Gruntilda She has some sort of weird machine that will supposedly transfer Tootys beauty to herself and this will leave Banjos poor sister ugly in the process So Banjo and his grumpy bird friend Kazooie who for some reason lives in Banjos backpack set out to Gruntildas lair to save Tooty The story doesnt take itself very seriously at all but theres a great humorous tone to it that more than makes up for the lack of depth

The game doesnt move from place to place at all the whole thing takes place in Gruntildas huge lair key word being huge This one location is just so big but perfectly balanced with the ease of traversing that it makes the perfect setting for a platforming game There is a whole lot of variety within the mountain lair with a sewer swamp graveyard and many other spots The areas of different theme will almost always take you to one of the games nine worlds which are all big diverse and have a lot of stuff to find Youll find yourself at a mountain to begin the game then moving on to a beach and later a snow area and haunted mansionlike world and so on The game never really runs out of new material to throw at you which is really nice even if most of the themes are found in many other games of the genre too

Another way Banjo always keeps itself fresh is with the moves you can learn In most of the levels you can find a mole named Bottles who will teach you a new move if you can find him These moves are sometimes confined to certain spots or items you can put on and they all work together perfectly to make the game progress logically You have to unlock some of these abilities such as flight and invincibility to get deeper into Gruntildas lair and also to accomplish more in the worlds The game controls very well too even with all the added moves and it doesnt get too complicated One issue though is with the camera which you can control the angle of but you still sometimes cant get the viewpoint thats just right for a room or area

But the core of the game stays the same no matter how many moves you learn or different worlds you visit The main objects to collect are jiggies which are basically pieces of jigsaw puzzles that when put together open the door to a new world Ten of these can be found in each level along with  notes which open up doors to new areas of the lair Unfortunately the games note total is merely a combined high score of how many notes you collect in each level each time you reenter a world the note count restarts This is pretty annoying sometimes and it would have been nice to just keep all the notes so you dont have to recollect all of them again to advance your total note count Thankfully the jiggies are extremely wellbalanced as far as how hard they are to get in the first world most of them are sitting on the ground like Easter eggs but as you progress through the game you have to work much harder to earn your way to more worlds

Graphically Banjo kept up to date well enough The visuals are just a tad choppy but they still look good enough and that sort of thing happened all the time in the N era Sometimes objects that are a little ways away wont appear on screen until you get closer which thankfully doesnt prove to be too annoying but still would be good if fixed Despite these few flaws though the graphics look great considering the times

One of Banjos shining areas aside from gameplay is the sound The characters speak in a gibberish sort of language with text shown on the bottom of the screen and this might annoy some but its still good to add personality to each character The sound effects are all good too no complaints there The really cool part of the sound though is the music The tracks are cool enough as they are but when youre standing on a different spot or in a different area like if youre under water or at the entrance to a different world the music style and sound totally changes while keeping the same song Then as you exit the spot the music transitions back to the normal style and this effect may sound small without actually hearing it but trust me when I say its really really cool

Mario  may have been the revolution but some of the games that derived bits and pieces from it were possibly even better in my opinion BanjoKazooie is one such game adding a lot of depth and value to an already proven formula It may not be the game everyone looked to for inspiration in the gamemaking world but BanjoKazooie is a real gem from Rares glory days on the N and it makes me want to play the sequel even if it is ten years old

FINAL SCORE I really love this game that is quite similar in concept to Super Mario  Though it is a lot simpler than its successor Banjo Tooie in that one there are many types of eggs plus you can change characters but it is a lot more fun The successor had a lot more dialog that you had to wade through

The final battle with Grunty is one of the toughest obstacles I have encountered in a video game and I still have not figured out a way to beat her without the unlimited gold feather cheatI really love this game that is quite similar in concept to Super Mario   Though it is a lot simpler than its successor Banjo Tooie in that one there are many types of eggs plus you can change characters but it is a lot more fun  The successor had a lot more dialog that you had to wade through

The final battle with Grunty is one of the toughest obstacles I have encountered in a video game and I still have not figured out a way to beat her without the unlimited gold feather cheatAfter Rareware turned GoldenEye into a systemseller for the Nintendo  it broke out again with the actionplatformer BanjoKazooie An ugly old witch named Gruntilda has taken Banjos sister Tootie and plans to suck the beauty out of her Banjo and Kazooie the bird that lives in his backpack must brave Gruntildas fortress to get Tootie back

The plot is a little sugary and kiddie but its really just an excuse to send gamers on a Mario style adventure where completing tasks and puzzles in worlds will open up new worlds to explore Yes its pretty much a clone of Mario but at the same time it refines and enhances the Mario formula Players have more unique special moves at their disposal and these are much more essential to navigating the environment and solving puzzles Worlds are beautiful creative and expansive tossing you into a room with a giant shark a huge snowman or a forest where you can actively move between the seasons Its all topped by memorable music that changes to fit the environment fades or grows louder depending on where you are in the stage

This is a game that has aged gracefully Yes its on an old system but the art design and music still hold up well like the classic Mario titles and gameplay is solid A masterful experience thats supplemented quite well by its sequel Banjo TooieThis is one game that will test your skills on how to figure things out but if you want to take the easy way out you can always get bottles the neer sighted moles help One thing i like about this game is that when Bottle  Kazooie confront each other they always throw smack at each other which makes the storyline more funnier This is a pretty cool game its worth buying I had fun playing it i will buy it

If you liked this game check out all of the other Banjo  Kazooie gamesBanjoKazooie is an action adventure game in the style of Super Mario  However it is similar yet also quite different Rather than having most of the skills you need at the beginning of the game you learn a few in the very beginning and then learn the remaining skills throughout the first six worlds there are nine but they are much larger than the fifteen in Mario  Notes are like coins and jiggies are like stars However rather than six stars in each world there are  jiggies to find in each world and  in the witchs castle much like the castle secret stars Also you can transform in five of the nine massive levels with the help of the crazy witch doctor MumboJumbo Generally it will help you get at least  Jiggy in the world and they can do things that Banjo and Kazooie cant on their own Throughout the game you get to transform into a termite level  an alligator level  a walrus level  a pumpkin level  and a bee level 

The nine massive worlds are each very different from eachother But how fun are they Well theyre all very fun to play in mainly because the tunes in each world really match the mood from eerie funeral dirges to peppy shipyard music this game has that and then some Overall I highly recommend it If you read my previous review of the game BanjoTooie youd see why I enjoyed the sound effects so much Once more I highly recommend this gameI have never played anything like this since Everything from Sly  Racoon to Ratchet and Clank owe it to this

Wicked witch Gruntilda takes Banjos sister to hey layer miles away in a realistic D cartoon world

Banjo is a bear with Kazooie a bird in his backpack that can help him jump and fly and basically you learn to do lots of things with it You solve puzzles via action and collect tolkens across lovely maps Mumbo Jumbo transforms Banjo into some other creatures along the way You can fly It was amazing A full adventure all the way to end We played it for months and I have NEVER played anything like it again The makers of Donkey Kong released it at the best time It is now up to the future generations to make adventure concepts better than this one This is one of the best N games everI am great at solving games i get within either a day or a couple of days so i am constantly buying new games Well this one has me stumped I cant get past this certain level so right now I am giving it a break LOL The game is fantastic More for tweens teens adults Not little kidsAll in all this is the best platform game that I have played in a long time Of course it follows the basic formula of a platformer  kidnapped female evil castle jump on enemies etc But the reason the formula still exists is due to the fact that occasionally it works really well BanjoKazooie is a case where the cliche works to perfection Although we question Nintendos blatant violation of the genetic cloning ban put in place by the president they did so for a good cause and a damn good gameThere is not much I can say except this is THE BEST GAME FOR N Not too easy not too hard tons of levels and objectives and the cutest cast of characters Jinjos rock If you like adventure games BanjoKazooie is for youNow that Banjo  Kazooie is over five years old a sequel now exist and there is likely another game coming HOPEFULLY The game only for the N is one of the most amazing platformers ever In fact its one of the most amazing games in any genre period It took a while to beat the game but it was well worth it If your not familiar with B  K let me explain Banjo is a bear with a handy backpack Kazooie is a bird who hangs out in Banjos backpack With the many special moves Kazooie pops out of the pack quite a bit Together they work through many HUGE levels collecting items like puzzle pieces  hidden through out the entire game musical notes  on each level little Jinjo people  on each level there are also Mumbo skulls to find they allow you once you have the required amount to change form you must visit the mumbo skull guy quite often Changing form is mandatory for instance B  K cannot fit into some smaller places Turning into an ant allows you to go into a small hole where prizes are not reachable otherwise Vast and adventurous B  K is impossible to dislike even if your not a fan of platformers Even if your just watching its entertaining Ill give you an idea of how effective the story is BANJO  KAZOOIE is THE WIZARD OF OZ of vidoe gamesRareware  words fail me Again they have made a quality title beyond imagination Creative beyond a shadow of a doubt   of people agree that BanjoKazooie is a landmark title with everything the N has to offer and that it is worthy of  out of  stars  While developed early in Ns lifespan the graphics stand out beyond many titles recently released The sound is equally as impressive for N and the game has been cleverly melded with it to make you feel as the atmosphere of the game has changed depending on your situation
I am proud to say many people love this game Many of my friends still play it occasionally however few have beaten it all the way This game is solid for  hours of gaming but only when you are willing to get every last puzzle piece and musical note and every other item Some people dislike it and do not be fooled a  year male old who listens to ultrahard rock and loves games with extreme violence andor nudity will NOT like this game It is by no means for everybody Many gamers from preschool to high school will like it but not everybody
The controls are easy enough to master and any avid or casual gamer will easily master them with a little practice The sound is superb The graphics are good for an N title There is not a dull moment in this game and the attention to detail is amazing The puzzles the meat of the game are easy enough for older kids to have a challenge and not to hard for younger kids The puzzle peices your reward for completeing a puzzle are well hidden The musical notes the only way to advance to the next portion of the overworld are challenging to find The most fun part of the game visiting Mumbo is quite enjoyable He transforms you into various forms A fat walrus a termite and even a bumble bee There isnt really an advancing story but thats okay You get an occasional cinematic but its pretty basic
The story goes
The evil witch Gruntilda is happily hanging out atop her mountain WHEN The cute Tootie sister of Banjo the bear strolls by Overcome with jealousy she sees Tootie is quite a bit cuter than her So she kidnapps Banjos sister and creates a machine to suck Tooties cuteness out and put it into her Banjo and his sidekick breegull Kazooie set off to find Tootie A mole named Bottles helps them learn some new moves to defeat various obsticles in the game
Well I hope you enjoy this game Thanks for reading this review and until next time
CRIMSONREDthis is the best n game ever made next to the wonderful ocarina of timei beat everything in it when i was i collected all the jinjosgot all the puzzle piecesetci bought it when i was its an amazingfun gamei just feel tormented that i had to use the players guide to beat the ndbanjotooiei try not to think about itbut this game is extremly hard and gruelingbut in a good waythe levels are extremly detailed and funmy favorite is the graveyardhaunted house leveli forgot its namebuy iti command youLike Super Mario and Donkey Kong this game is a classic The good gameplay and graphics pay off  This is worth the moneyIf you own a N this game has to be in your collection Not only is it a classic that offers countless replayability but it is a great competitiveparty game to battleplay with friends and familyI bought this microphone to further enhance my Rock Band experience  I was not disappointed  It kept in tune well which was a problem I saw with other microphones and was light enough to not be a burden of any kind  I dont mind that it is not wireless since I wouldnt move around much anyways  Also the fact that it doesnt have buttons didnt bother me mainly because I dont mind using a controller to navigate  I do think it could have been packaged better but I dont fault the microphone for it  Overall a very simplistic yet functional design that works wellThis game arrived quickly and as described I am happy with this purchase Thank youThe best Mario Kart still to this day  I have played all of them and this one still holds up as my favorite even if the roster isnt the most robust  Some of the best tracks and the music on Rainbow road is just amazingThis game will teach you who your friends truly are as the blue shell destroys freindships and breaks bonds of companionship you never thought could be brokenLove this game came on time  works perfectly on my nno glitches no freezesjust great playi recommendWorks great with Xbox  I have  of these using Xbox usb hub and have no problems using with rockband Not very good if sharing a mic from sides works best by pointing voice directly on top of micI have played the old anno  AND   this game looks great but is more complex than the previous versions of the game I found a lot of things lacking such as the sources of power and an inability to store energy with batteries or regenertive fuel cells as buildings in the game need power Trade is about the same My main beef with this it requires an internet connection Other than that it has wonderful artistry and graphics It is the same as anno  but set in a future world where global warmming as flood the land and resource scarcity has sent human kind to look to the deep ocean for valuable minerals I recoment the deep ocean expansion or complete if you get this I found the ai instructor a little corny but other than that the game has some real polish I wrote my  cents worth on suggestions on anno  wiki and you can read  pages on that for game ideas I had
