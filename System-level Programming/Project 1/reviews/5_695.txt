When my cousin first got this on his birthday, I was thinking " this is just gonna be like all the other snowboarding games I've played".  Man was I wrong!  With 8 levels of exciting, heart stopping jump, twists and turns, this is one game you don't wanna miss.  It has all the best modes, Match Race<this is where you earn hidden levels against the computer>, 2 Player, Trick Attack, Time Attack,and Contest, this is one game that won't get tiring fast.  Heed this warning:if you buy this game, don't go after the 1080 just yet, it's hard to master.  What more do I have to say?  Buy this game!
