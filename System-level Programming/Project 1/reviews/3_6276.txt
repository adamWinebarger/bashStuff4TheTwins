okay first of all, this game like any other final fantasy is different from each other which is good but you have got to know how  to divide yourself from your predecessor. This game was very good on certain standards but i Expected more. I have played every final fantasy and this one is in between the good final fantasy and the bad final fantasy. I liked this game and in fact i own this game but i was dissapointed. Overall, it is a game to check out.
