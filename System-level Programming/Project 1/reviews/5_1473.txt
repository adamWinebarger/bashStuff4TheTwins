I grew up playing Super Mario 64. If you are considering buying this game, don't hestitate or think twice. This game is really fun. It can keep you entertained for hours. The graphics are simply stunning even by today's standards, considering the age of this game. It is a CLASSIC, MUST HAVE for any N64 players, Mario fans or video game fanatics.
