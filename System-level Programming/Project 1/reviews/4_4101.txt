Mech Warriors 3 is a game that no doubt has revolutionized the graphics industry. There is no other way to put it, the graphics are really great, surprising for an older game! The game is so fun, and I like the way you can customize the way your bot looks, moves, and fires. My friend did something that was so cool, I do it too. He took one of the heavyweights, and put on almost 100 LRM's and two gause rifles(Probably the best weapon),one on each hand. He then battled several of those tiny robots-whos name escapes me-and took em out, indian style. It was cruel, but totally awesome. I use that tactic almost every time on battle mode.
If you go to options, you can turn off the heat sensors(I hate them) and put on invincibility, which is also cool.
For kids who's parents don't like them getting violent games, probably don't want this because of how discusting it is to kill one of the people running on the ground. It reminds me of Half-life.
I think this game is worth it new or used, and recommend it to bot-lovin kids.
