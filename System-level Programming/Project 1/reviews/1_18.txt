I'm sure I would love the game, if I could play it, I have loved all the Hitman games thus far.  The one star is due to steam.  Steam is absolutely beyond annoying and they do NOT help you if you ask them.  I found out after I purchased it that windows xp does not support direct X-10.  I do have a high end video card but it doesn't make a difference.  I recommend that no one purchase any games or other items that require steam.  Perhaps then they will fix all the problems or go out of business (my favorite option).  I am very good with computers (built mine) so that is not the problem.  As always it's a steam issue.
