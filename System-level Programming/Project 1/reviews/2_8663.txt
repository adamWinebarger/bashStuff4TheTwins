This game has no sense of linearity to it at all... You spend most of the game trying to figure out where to go next, and mostly being wrong. I can't even really say this game was remotely fun to play. In fact, the only reason I kept playing was because I was hoping to find some kind of story hidden in this madness... but I didn't.
The game boasts seven different main characters, all with their own backgrounds and skills. You can play the game as any one of them, while meeting the rest along the way. The problem is that all the intertwining story-lines get so crosswired that after a while you don't remember who's character you are really playing, and what your original goal was.
In the same respect, the game is huge. Once you get past a certain stage, the entire world is left before you, and you can go where you want, and do what you want, without having to stay within the confines of your particular storyline. Some people may like this freedom, but I found it annoying! I love the idea of being able to explore the world on my own, but I never had a sense of purpose throughout the game. I never really knew where to go next, and every time I went to a new city I just felt like I was going around in circles and not making any progress.
Needless to say, I haven't completed this game, and I don't plan on it anytime soon. This game is just bad! If you want to wander aimlessly around a series of cartoony cities, each with hidden dungeons and shops and no sense of purpose whatsoever, then by all means get this game. I for one would rather spend my money on a nice root canal, or perhaps a spinal tap.
