This Game is a good game depending on your personality.  If you like to drive around in a car in  New  York City or shooting up alien invaders,in other words you like games with a lot of action, then this is probably not the game for you.  there is no action, or enemies.  Myst is more of exploring and puzzle solving.  It requires quite a bit of patience to play.  If your looking for an adventure/puzzle game then you should get myst. in my opinion it is a great game.  one of the best i have ever played
