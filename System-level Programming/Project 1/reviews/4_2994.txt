Playing Shadowgate 64 was my first time playing any Shadowgate game....and I gotta say, this sure was fun as hell.

It's like a first-person shooter....but....not. You're in first person mode, and you go around searching for clues in the castle. Doesn't sound like fun, right? Wrong. The graphics are beautiful and the levels are nicely done and full of goodies. Going around solving the game's many puzzles isn't tedious in any way....it's a joy, and it's a journey many should take the time to take.

Sure, the game has a few downsides....one being that your guy walks around like a lumbering beast. Slow as hell. And then the other is that there were a few times I died cheap....like thinking I would be able to swim, jumping into the water, and immediately drowning, because obviously elves didn't get the poolside lessons....lol. Oh well, though, it was actually good for a laugh. Just save your game often, and get this game now!!!

Overall, 9 out of 10, a solid title to add to your N64 collection.
