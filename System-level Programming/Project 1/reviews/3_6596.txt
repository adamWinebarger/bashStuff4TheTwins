This is a great game but it gets old way to fast. It isn't worth the money if it was cheaper i would say buy it because despite how boring it gets it is fun for about the first month. The graphics are descent and the lack of plot doesnt really matter because its fun enough just shooting things and stealing cars. So i say wait for the price to go down then buy it
