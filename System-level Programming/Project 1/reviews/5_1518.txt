I got this game MANY years ago for the N64, and I just loved it! The game presented a large challenge, while at the same time made it very fun! The music is the best heard in a game, the graphics are superb for an N64 title, and this Mario game is a blast! I guess the most noticeable feature are the environments that the game provides. Every environment that Mario enters is just awesome! I especially love the Rainbow level and the Snow level where all of the penguins are. The best feature is the fact that every age group can enjoy the hours of entertainment from the game and they can all enjoy collecting stars from each stage to save Peach and defeat Bowser. Oh, by the way, the Bowser levels are AWESOME! Fighting Bowser himself is very fun as well! The game is also good in the fact that it provides unsatirical yet not stupid humor as well. This is great for younger gamers. I guess the worst part of Super Mario 64 is the lack of replayability. It's like Vice City where it will take months to play and finish the game, but once it's done, you won't want to play it again without getting bored. Once the ride's over, you'll feel like you can't go play it each day, and the game is kind of wasted in that aspect. Overall, if you are a fan of Mario or Nintendo, then this game may just be suited for your needs! My rating-9.2!
