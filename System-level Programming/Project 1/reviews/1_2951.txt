This game does not, in fact, star Superman. It stars his genetically engineered clone created by Lexcorp known as Stuporman. Stuporman staggers like a drunken person, relies on power-ups for super powers, pulls punches so enemies beat him, likes random time limits (including ones that lead to an instant game over), can pass through solid objects like they aren't even there, and can die from things that cannot hurt the real man of steel in a million years, like ordinary bullets and explosions. He was created for the sole purpose of ruining Superman's reputation by making him look pathetic and weak. All part of Lex Luthor's evil plan! If you love Superman, don't buy this game, or you'll be buying into a lie!
