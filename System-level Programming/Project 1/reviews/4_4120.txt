Alright, ill start off with the bad,then the good. The first bad part of the game that plagues every sport game, it takes to much blankin memory. Good lord, the back says it takes 184.hey, they {were incorrect], 189.sounds like it doesnt make a difference, well it does.if it took as much as they say it did,i wouldnt have had to delete game files to play it.....another thing, although the games sound is excellent, the voive over becomes repetetive after some amount of hours in gameplay. Now to the good. The gameplay is great,decently fast, with varied difficulty levels. However, if you're playing rookie, then you move up to pro.its almost impossible, the learning curve is high. But the graphics look really great.im not comparing this game to its more famous counterpart nfl2k1. Im saying the graphics are great, sound is just as great,and gameplay is excellent. You can create your own player(it has a good create a player mode)or even a team!!however, what really stinks is you cant play with a created team in a season,thats stupid. Now the season mode is pretty cool.you could have fun with this even if you don't like football, and if you do like me, youll have ablast. And with the great price it has, it won't put a big bend in your wallet.solid.
