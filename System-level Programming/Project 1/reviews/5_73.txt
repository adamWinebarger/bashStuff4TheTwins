This is a must have for a Zelda collector. Even if it just goes on a shelf to never be opened, it looks great! Some of the guides in it I never saw released (Twilight Princess) and I wonder how I missed them. Great buy for the just over $100 I paid. A lot of the guides by themselves are selling $40-50 ea.
