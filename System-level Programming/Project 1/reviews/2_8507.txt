Don't get me wrong, its an ok game, its kinda fun, at the same time I don't see why this game is so amazing. The music is suppose to be good, I thought it didn't do the SNES sound chip any justice. Gameplay is quite repetitive, I know a lot of games can be repetitive but its a repition that bores me. Your constantly locating stuff, that got boring. But I will say, if I was bored or just killing time before I go out it would be good for a few rounds to play. The story line is pretty impressive, so I guess the game deserves props in that area. The game is good in its own little ways, but I just don't rank it up there with some of the other classics. I have some friends that love this game, so I guess I respect it for what it is.
