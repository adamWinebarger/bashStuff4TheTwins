SOnic is back and is looking like he never has before. This game is very fun and addictive. It has awesome graphics, and has tons of levels. The only bad thing I can think of about this game is it is a little to easy. You can unlock up to six characters,each with their own adventure. You can play mini-games, and replay previous levels. This is a great game and no one should miss out on it. The short version: Graphics: 4.8 Sound: 4.6 Control: 4.5 Fun Factor: 4.8 Total: 4.7
