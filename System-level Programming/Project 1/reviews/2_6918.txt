When I ordered my N64 it was listed as newly refurbished in excellent condition with 1 Controller and 1 Game.  When I finally got home I opened the box to find a faded scratched up N64 with the original out dated jumper pack and a dirty completely worn out Controller with the Analog Stick nearly fallen off.  I also got the game without the manual in Excellent condition otherwise, but it was a title nobody has ever heard of.  I installed the unit to my TV and it turned on with visable shaking screen, but I was put off by the poor condition of the product and have decided not to use it in my living room.  I got what I paid for, but the item was NOT in excellent condition.
