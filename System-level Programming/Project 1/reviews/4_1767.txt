Namco Museum 3 (third in a series of five collections of old arcade hits) hits some high and low spots, but is well worth the purchase price for three games.  The best of the lot is the translation of Ms Pac-Man - very faithful to the original.  Galaxian is highly addictive and equally faithful to the original.  Most people don't give Dig-Dug the credit it's due - it is very entertaining - even for adults.  I rather liked Dig-Dug in the arcades, and this is a good rendition.  On the other hand, "Phozon" and "Tower of Druga" are very forgettable, "Tower" the most worthless of the lot.  Still well worth buying just for the excellent Ms Pac Man.
