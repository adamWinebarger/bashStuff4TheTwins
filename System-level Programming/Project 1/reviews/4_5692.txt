Thief: The Dark Project, in my opinion, was pretty tedious compared to the fast-moving sequel. It started out fine, but it got really dull and annoying when I reached the zombie-infested parts of the game which include levels like Down in the Bonehoard and The Haunted Cathedral. I loved it at first, seeing new types of opponent apart from the usual guards, but the fun dies out pretty quickly because of the level structure. This is'll be a complete nuisance if the difficulty's set on Expert. The objectives of levels which have zombies and burricks are pretty demanding and they're all not located in convenient places. It requires a lot of going back and forth, which means that sometimes you face the enemies all over again as it's impossible to kill more than 1 especially since they move around in groups, so a quick glance, dart and hide is done mostly throughout the game.

The other levels are pretty "civilized", which involve reasonable objectives, and most of these are taken place in the City where it's mostly guaranteed you won't see mythical monsters like the zombies and the burricks.

The reason why this game mainly revolves around these monsters is because of the storyline. Garrett, the thief you play, finds himself being involved with dark Pagan rituals, people who worship the forces of nature and live in woods.

The graphics and lighting are amazing, and really set the atmosphere. I recommend this game, but a getting a lot from it is not to be expected.
