I didn't beat the game so I guess my opinion shouldn't count...but here it is:

This game has GREAT historical value. Prince: Sands of Time, Soul Reaver, God of War and many others are based on some things that Tomb Raider made popular.

Game would be perfect if save points were better placed. It would be best to have a save game option at any point but those were old times...

What I disliked: I beat Mexico levels playing each one two to six hours. I got to St Francis' Folly level.

Things started to look really tiresome: first, I spent too much energy beating pillar sub-level and didn't have spare medpack reaching ground floor. I restarted. I got enough energy by reaching ground but wasn't able to beat pool puzzle on top. Then I figured out that I should have gone to the ground WITHOUT USING SAVE CRYSTALS, open all puzzle doors (top level door is connected to ground switch) and then climb back up...which means another level restart.

Maybe this game is for hardcore fans, but I am not one of them...I got frustrated enough to quit.
