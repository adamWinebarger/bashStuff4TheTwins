Really though, could an old, out dated game still be awesome 4 years later?  The answer is yes, because this game is just too good.  It gives you a complete story on Hyrule and the Triforce, not to mention the best video game music ever (especially the boss music).  Being able to play as young link and adult link in two similar, yet in a way completely different worlds as one would find out sooner or later.  The graphics are still, and when this was released, it was the best game graphicwise as well.  The bosses are easy, yet in a way challenging, and the dungeons and temples are amazingly designed.  However, there are two faults, one minor, one somewhat major.
-Link is missing the strap on his frontside that holds his sword case thingy!  Well, it just kinda looks odd.
-The "final boss" is far too easy...but don't be too sure of that...
