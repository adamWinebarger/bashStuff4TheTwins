This is definitely one of the best games you can find. Crash, a bandicoot as his name applies, is out to rescue his girlfriend Tawna from his arch nemesis, the evil Dr. Cortex. There are about 30 levels in the whole game to go through, in which range from extremely easy to almost impossible. The game is probably the hardest of all the Crash games, so anybody who wants a challenge is in for a treat. The graphics range. In some, the graphics will have you staring, and in some, you just plain will not be impressed, but I'm not saying anything about that. This game has a high amount of replay value as well, and for some levels you will need strategy. The only reason I gave this 4 stars is because of the horrible save system. You can only save if you get to Tawna bonus rounds, (common) and complete them, (not too difficult), or collect a Gem, (medium difficulty to almost impossible.) If you can overlook the save system, then you've got yourself a great game.
