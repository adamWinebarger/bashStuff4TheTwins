Hard to believe it has been almost 20 years since the release of Goldeneye. It makes me feel old and decrepit. Those were the days of actually sitting down with your friend and playing multiplayer together. Xbox Live and online has since essentially ruined those days of genuine bro bonding. Now texting and Facebook has taken over anything social with letter writing and actually picking up the phone and calling someone is becoming rarer. It's sad really!

Thankfully we can go back to simpler times and dust off the 64 and play Goldeneye. What was I even doing in 1997? I was 10 and had not one care in the world. All the main players are here doing the actual voicework and even the director of the Goldeneye film directs the gameplay. The graphics are still passable but something I didn't remember is the extreme slowdown during lots of on-screen explosions or action. It can take quite a bit outta the game and cause the shooting of your weapon a slight delay or lag. Not a complete game changer but certainly takes a point away from an otherwise excellent game.

The kills are hilarious, shoot a guy in the leg he hops, or he will hold his wound and croak slowly. Really amazing and funny AI here, certainly revolutionary as they will even attempt to hide behind cover. Not sure the exact number of missions, maybe around 20? Including the jungle, snowy and runway areas. Bond sports the classic PP7 along with other cool gadgets and weaponry, you can even man a tank in a certain mission. The cheats are great, including a paintball mode, all guns and others. The juiciest part of the game is certainly the multiplayer. Nothing beat grabbing a few friends and karate chopping away at each other or just use the throwing knives.

Definitely a game that revolutionized console FPS shooters. A definite must have for all retro gamers and Bond fanatics alike.
