This is one of the games I still play on Dreamcast. In an effort to keep the fewest amount of equipment around my tv, I decided to get the playstation version of this game. I must say that I was disappointed in the graphics and how grainy it is. You can't see to far in the distance. I thought it was going to be the same. Oh well. If you've never played this game before, it's still the same fun. I can give it that. I don't want to draw any comparisons to Twisted Metal. I like both. For the price, it's worth a shot but if you still play Dreamcast, get that version instead.
