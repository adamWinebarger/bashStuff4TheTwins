This is a Sonic game in 3D, that about sums it up. Everything you would expect from a traditional Sonic game is here.  Fast paced gameplay, great graphics, a memorable soundtrack, all of the holes to fall in and glitches also. If you go too fast, you will often find yourself getting stuck in a wall or falling through the scenery. The camera also seems to have a hard time keeping up with the action. The stages of the game are standard Sonic, including an ice level, a casino level, a green hill-type level, ect.  Though many of the features in Sonic Adventure are just revisions of older ideas, there are also some new additions that keep the game fresh. Plenty of mini-games and multiple characters give the game replay value. Despite the minor drawbacks, Sonic Adventure is one game for the Dreamcast that should not be missed.
