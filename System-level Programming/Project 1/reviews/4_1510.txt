What a great game, I like it alot. The only problems I found were:
1: It gives off way too many hints to how to complete a puzzle or beat a boss(EXAMPLE: On the first time you fight Bowser, he says "Can you get behind me and grab my tail? I think not!"

2: Moving around is kinda stupid because Mario can't move to the different direction fast enough and he slips on the floor when he moves.

Other than these flaws, this is a solid title that deserves to be in your collection.
