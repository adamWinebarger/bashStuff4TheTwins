Like many other people, I absolutely adore racing games and the Mario games.  Then I saw this come out.  It was perfect!  It was a racing game with the characters from the Super Mario series!  I was so excited to play it.  My friends and I played it all night.  It was so addicting.  In fact, I still play this game today.
