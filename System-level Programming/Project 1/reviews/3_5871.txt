Overall decent game.  I just hate the constant load times it really slows down the game and just makes it feel very stagnant.  I also think the CPU is unfair because the game becomes next to impossible after about the 3rd fighter even when it's on very easy!!!! every move you do is countered perfectly by the computer which is the thing I hate the most.. however I do like the one button fatalities and the huge selection of characters.
