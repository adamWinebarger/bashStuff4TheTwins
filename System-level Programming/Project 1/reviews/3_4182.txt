This game had it's pros, and it had its cons.  Pro - fun for everyone, good clean fun  Con - nothing really to difficult, just making sure you stop the line on another line.  Pro - Lots of different ways to play, you can play tournaments, or practice, putting challenges, and you have to get birdie badges.  Con - Usually Mario is the bomb guy, but in this game he's a really bad golfer :}  But overall, this is a good game, that a five year old can play, so go out and get your copy today!
