At the time when racing games came out for Nintendo 64, San Francisco Rush was a game that was unlike anything that hit the street. The game showcased unlike anything imaginable with its high energy, and exterme driving. Nevertheless, any game worth driving always needs a second opinion. It is important to see it to know if you like it.
When San Francisco Rush came out in 1997, it was a little more crazy unlike anything I've ever raced. The graphics were just amazing, but unfortunately, the controls were just a little bit awkward, and hard to steer through the streets of San Francisco. The game anyway features six tracks to choose from, three not released in the arcades, and a extra special hidden track. Before it was a choice in Rush 2, it was featured here, Alcatraz. The amazing course did have some cuts, but it wasn't that extreme until nearly a year later. The game also features a couple of hidden cars to seek, while driving. There are hidden keys located on the street, unlocking 2 cars to choose from, once there accessed, a hidden taxi cab, and a devilish prowler.
Although there were two different versions of Rush that came out during the time, one for Playstation, the other for Nintendo 64, they both seemed a little bit flawed, but enjoyable. Nevertheless, if you had a choice, I would suggest picking up Rush 2 Extreme Racing U.S.A. for Nintendo 64. But, unfortunately, for Playstation buffs, that was the last Rush there was. If you like this game, pick it up. If not, depending if you own a Nintendo 64, get another racing game.
