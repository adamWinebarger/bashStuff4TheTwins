Not perfect by any means, but it has addicted me. Graphics are OK. Voice-overs are not the kind Blizzard has made us come to expect. Not the best story. But I am enjoying it- and for thirty bucks that says a lot.
True, they also won't win any points for originality... all though there  are a number of game play innovations that I hope the staff at Diablo II  won't ignore(upgrading weapons, skills, better mapping, running, and that  feature that autopilots you to certain places you've been before). Single  player was fun- featuring the ability to use two characters, but as with  almost games I play nowadays- multiplayer is what I care about. And with  two good friends- We had quite a blast romping through the dungeons at  Heat.net, all though its difficult to get a game going there as it hasn't  achieved a high level of popularity. What made it even better was that the  three of us were using Roger Wilco to communicate. It felt like we were in  our High school Dungeons and Dragons days even though we were in different  states.
Well until Diablo II comes out (as many have said) you could do a  lot worse than this game.
