Medal of Honor is one of the best first person shooter games available, in that it is creative and original.  History buffs will enjoy the realistic feel of the game as you explore the various mission zones.  Weapons are ample and realistic.  Controls are simple and easy to learn.  Missions are clearly explained and while challenging, are not frustrating.  There is a great deal of variety in each mission too.  You'll need to use a combination of firepower and stealth to successfully complete your goal.
The only reason this game did not get higher marks is the unforgivable problem with the graphics.  There is alot of camera issues and breakup, which is a huge problem for games of this genre.  Also, there is a problem with polygon drop out to the point where all of a sudden you can see through a wall or obstacle, which can really throw you off.  Additionally, the replay value of this game is extremely low as there is nothing new to aspire to.  If you are really into historic games or first person shooters, then give this game a try.  Although, if you want more game for your money, try Medal Gear Solid.
