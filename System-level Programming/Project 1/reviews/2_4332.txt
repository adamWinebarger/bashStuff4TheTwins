I'm not very happy with this because it wouldn't not load onto my computer and I tried everything I could to try to get it to load no such luck. I got to the point where I just gave up and put it on a shelf and that's where it is but every time i walk past it I get so upset that i spent money on a game that won't load on my computer. What a waste of money
