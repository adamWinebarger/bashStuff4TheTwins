The first Tenchu to come out (which is the reason why there isn't a number behind Tenchu) and the first Tenchu I have ever played, also the Tenchu that forced me to fall in love with the series. When I first played the game it was love at first sight, no one-night stand here, this one's a keeper. The game takes place in Feudal Japan; the game starts at the time period and impressively stays there through the entire game. You won't find anything you wouldn't find in the time period (Yes, Feudal Japan did have guns). Some people would complain about the over-exaggerated bloodshed and the sometimes-cheesey dialogue. I must disagree with these people these two factors made me enjoy the game even more. "What the hell!?! Why would that make a game better?" You maybe asking, well those two features made me feel as though I was watching an old Japanese Kung-Fu movie, minus the kung fu that's how I believe you must think of this game to fully enjoy it. After watching the ending I believe that's the effect the creators wanted to put in this game, after seeing the end sequence yourself you'll know what I mean. Of course the bad camera angles sometimes made this game annoying. In order to block your opponent's attacks you must hold down which a lot of the time backed you into a corner.... The reason I only gave it three stars? I don't think this is a game for everyone, that's why. I believe this game will be a rare collectible in the future, so buy this game now and save yourself future trouble.
