The N64 port of the original NFL Blitz was such insane football game. I recall renting it several times back in Blitz's heyday. The players are so aggressive, and you literally beat the other team to death all the way through.

NFL Blitz 2000 appears to be pretty much the same game with better graphics, a play editor, a 4-person multiplayer, and a roster update. Like the original, you have a series of passing plays that you use to gain 30 yards in 4 plays. Also like the original, all conventional rules regarding football have been thrown out the window. It's a pretty wild ride.

Right now, in 2012, if you're collecting N64 games for nostalgia's sake or for whatever , I'd say one of the console's Blitz games is a good and necessary investment. They're definitely "core" N64 games.. whatever that means. However, it's not the kind of football game you can really sit down and enjoy too too much by yourself. It's a lot of fun to just knock the daylights out of your friends in Blitz. But alas, the AI just can't provide the kind of reaction that makes it entertaining.
