This game, in the tradition of Myst and Riven, has appealing environments, reasonably challenging puzzles and a solid storyline, and is ultimately fun to play.  Unlike Myst and Riven, Crystal Key offers a 3-D environment to  navigate via Quicktime movies rather than clicking through two-dimensional  snapshots.  There are some disappointments, however.  Graphics quality is  uneven, and while I avoided serious difficulties the software does seem to  contain some bugs. The soundtrack has some pleasing snippets of music, but  clearly the producers didn't bother putting together much of a musical  score.  The interface, while easy to use, reveals some solutions through  its highlighting of "hot spots" on the screen.  The end of the  game lacks the payoff sequence you'd hope to see after spending all those  hours working through the puzzles and saving the world.  Ultimately, one  has some sense that this is basically an unfinished product, but at the  price offered, its not a bad value.
