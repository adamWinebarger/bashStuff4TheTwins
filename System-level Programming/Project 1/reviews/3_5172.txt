Baldur's Gate is the best AD&D game to come around in a while, but it drove me absolutely insane for the first few hours.  Why?  Because in the beginning, there are quite a few people who want you dead...including a few  powerful (at least at THAT point) wizards.  At low levels, a guy can walk  up to you, say "Okay, I'm going to kill you now," and quite  suddenly knock you out in 1-2 hits.  After a while though, you'll get into  it.  Man, you have to watch yourself in this game, because there is are  deceptive people in *every town!*  Lots of characters walk up to you asking  for help, and end up being villains!  To wrap it up, it's a keeper.  (especially the bundled version w/the expansion pack) but don't get  discouraged at the beginning, because that's the hardest part.  Once you  get by that, you'll have a good game with lots of side quests and  longitivity.
