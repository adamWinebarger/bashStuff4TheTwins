Awful AI, save and load problems, game interface is sometimes useless. I had expected much better from a Masquerade adaptation. The only positives are graphics and sounds, but not enough to save a boring game. Keep playing the pen and paper, and unless you are a world of darkness fanatic, spend your money for a better game!
