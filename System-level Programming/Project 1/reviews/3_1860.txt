Though officially the 4th installment in the MK series, Mortal Kombat 4 followed one upgrade game, a compilation game, and a Sub-Zero spinoff game, making it around the 7th actual produced game for the series. It was the first game to utilize a 3-D engine, and the first MK game to feature weapons combat.

While the 3-D engine was a refreshing change of pace after the stale, sprite-based animation of the previous entries, in truth MK4 gets dull rather quickly. Without the 3-D engine, it's pretty much the same as previous installments, only with less characters and less finishing moves. The idea to finally drop the silly finishers like Friendships and Babalities was a good one, but once you go through all the finishers and stage fatalities, you've pretty much seen it all. The basic fight engine is solid, but feels a little too simplistic and generic. The pre-programmed combos were toned down, which should be a good thing, but after awhile you miss the 'wow' factor that came with delivering them. The sidestepping button doesn't really do enough to change things, and weapons are so easily lost that its not worth pulling them out except for the coolness factor.

MK4's still decent and worth buying if you find a used cartridge around, but only because the N64 seriously lacked solid fighting games. The Playstation had plenty of 2-d and 3-d fighters that made MK4 pale in comparison. It's still fun to go a few rounds with friends, and its a nice pre-cursor to the more advanced Deadly Alliance and Deception, but the game just doesnt leave you satisfied.
