By far this game it's much more fair than the original Tomb Raider. This one at least let you safe the progress anywhere in the game without looking for any type of save crystals which made original game incredibly difficult and punishing.  This sequel may not be the best game out there for the PS1 but at least it's a bit more fun to play.
