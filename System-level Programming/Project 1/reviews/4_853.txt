The game is overrated. Don't get sucked into all the hype. It's more nostalgic for the people who played it when it first came out. The graphics are honestly really bad and the controls make you feel like you're drunk. I guess that's where the fun is though, because honestly I really did like the game. I played through it and although the gameplay schematics were a bit...strange, it was oddly addicting. Multiplayer is a lot of fun though when you have friends sitting down in the basement all hooked up. It can get pretty intense on split screen, seriously. 5 stars for the split screen! 4 stars overall because the gameplay was repetitive and the graphics were vomit. They could have been better for the time period and the N64 was capable of handling better than this. Still, worth the buy. Get it.
