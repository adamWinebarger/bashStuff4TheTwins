This game is average. It is all about being a dinosaur hunter and trying to get dangerous dinosaurs for trophies. Despite hating real life hunters and being a nature lover, I still must say, since the weapons and dinos were cool and it was all fake, this game did have a couple of pluses. It is all right, and if you can't find anything to do whatsoever, it's probably worth a shot playing this. However, it gets three stars only because there are just a few too many bad spots for it to be in my top games. I don't have it anymore, and do not plan to buy it again, but at least it was okay while it lasted.
