I have to say this is the absolute best Legend of Zelda so far...  But there is one thing I have to clarify THIS IS NOT THE FIRST LEGEND OF ZELDA!!!  The first came out on the NES and is Great to play....  This one has good control, fun plot, and will get you so wrapped up in it, you'll come screaming back for more.
