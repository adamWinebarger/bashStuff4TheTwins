Well I finally bought this game after hearing so many stories of how people catch "scare attacks" and what-not and not for nothing... I was totally! let down... I've played Fatal Frame and found that game to be down-right terrifying, and was hoping to get the same feel with silent hill, but nope... not at all...

Maybe it's because I'v ebeen spoiled by Fatal Frame? or maybe I should have played it when it was first! released... but I actually found this game to be kinda cute... lol. Following the monsters in the dark when they can't see you is funny, and beating them in the back of the head with a pipe when they're not looking is even funnier.

Some! things that seemed errie were the camera angles, the music and some voices that you hear. The darkness factor is alright but that radio? ugh... the worst! attempt to a creepy sounding radio noise... The puzzles were ok, and the monsters?... zombie dogs and flying bat things aren't scary... I'll finish playing the game hoping to be scared to the point were I scream like I did with Fatal Frame, although I don't think it'll happen. An ok game to add to a collection, just so you can tell who-ever was scared of this game that they need something more to scream about. :)
