Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back is the second in a long line of Crash Bandicoot's. This Game is almost totally flawless (but hey, every game can't be perfect but this game comes damn close.)

Plot: Crash is back kidnapped to help Cortex collect crystals. 9/10

Gameplay: The Gameplay is what you'd expect in a platformer. There are five warp rooms with twenty-five levels. You have to finish each level by collecting all three crystals for that level. If you run out of lives you lose and can return to the last level played. 8/10

Sound: The sound is very good and has a nice soundtrack. 8/10

Graphics: The graphics were high quality back in 1997. They still are surprising for today's standards, They work and are eye appealing. 7/10

Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back is one of the best Naughty Dog PlayStation 1 game. Easily put, Crash Bandicoot 2 is WAY better than the first.
8/10
