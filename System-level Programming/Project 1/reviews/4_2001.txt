This was a fun 3D platform adventure game.  Croc may look cute and easy to play but It was definitely challenging even for veteran video game players.  The game is very bright with colorful backgrounds, with lots of stomping and jumping on crates and boxes.  The boss fights were very well done and exciting.  The controls took a little bit of getting used to but the gameplay overall was responsive and fun.  The game is appropriate for all ages, and the bonus levels are fun and interesting.

The game does take some strategy and you have to be very quick in several parts of the game.  It is in the same spirit of the Mario 64 game but not as polished or well refined.  The camera angles do make it hard to maneuver Croc in some parts of the game which add to the challenge.  The replay value is pretty high.  I spent a lot of time playing this game trying to get the 100 percent to make it to the true boss of the game.  It provided hours of fun as well as a lot of frustration but overall it was a very rewarding experience.  The game should be fairly cheap now, the game had a battery pack save feature which saved your progress on the memory card.  If your looking for something a little bit different than Mario this is a nice game to try out.

Overall I would rate it a solid 4 stars its not a perfect platformer, but the game was made with a lot of care, the developers did a really good job.  Collecting all the Gobbos is fun but some of the stages will drive you nuts.
