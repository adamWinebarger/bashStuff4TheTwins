This game is great and fun to play. They are many powers that you can get like flying and so on. The color of the background is alright. The color look's smooth and rich and bright.
There are lot of bosses that you have to beat and alot of stars to find. In order to fine them look very, very, hard you never know a star could be under your nose.
The level's are cooler and better than the other old mario games that I playden in a long time.
The level's can be very very hot or very cold places or the level's can have water so you have to swim. Or some of the level's can be nice or normal.
In the game Mario can do some cool moves like back flip and so on. In the level's you don't get one star there are many star's in one level. Each level has many star's to fine. Get the star's and be very very powerful.
