Railroad Tycoon II is a real time strategy game by Poptop software with complex interactions, interesting graphics and lots of thinking. The gameplay reminds me of Chris Sawyer's Transport Tycoon, In which you play a tycoon who control the trains, buses, planes and ships in the tycoon world. In RRT2 you play as the railroad baron and control the train transportation, Buy and sell stocks, set the train routes, lay the railway tracks, stations and take over companies. There are lots of real life trains and cities. The gameplay is quite good, It takes a while to learn to play and be good at it. RRT2's graphics are very good, The towns are very beautifully desinged, There are lots of beautiful terrain and real looking buildings, The world looks real, with rivers, forests, snow and hilly mountains. RRT2's screnario's are also very well desinged and a lot fun to play, It also comes with a screnario editor for you to create your own screnario's. Railroad Tycoon II has got a clumsy interface, It is very hard to lay the tracks with the mouse. There are other annoying factors like, You don't get enough money, It's hard to manage things when you have a lot of trains and stations, You need to pay a lot of attention at the stock market to make money ect. Railroad Tycoon II is a very good game but quite hard to play. If you like this game get Transport Tycoon, It is more intresting, lot more fun and quite easy compared to this.
