The Genesis version of Mortal Kombat 3 is not that bad. The graphics are pretty good,as is the sound. The only bad thing about this game though,is it's VERY VERY hard to play with a three button controller. If you buy this game,I highly recommend that you buy a six button controller along with it,if you don't already have one,because it's hell to play it with a three button. Overall,this is a fun game. Not the best of the series,but still pretty good.
