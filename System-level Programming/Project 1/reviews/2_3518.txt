The Resident Evil series has been on a steady decline since the first game came out in the mid-90's.  It seems that they make these games harder and harder than they should be and Code Veronica is no exception.  It's not the simplistic puzzles that make the game difficult, rather, it's the lack of ammo and healing items that make what what should be easy battles far more difficult than they should be.
Why do some zombies take more bullets than others?  Why do zombies respawn in some areas?  What's up with all the backtracking in this game?  You're still forced to use the stupid typewriter ribbons to SAVE?  These are some of the questions you'll ask yourself when you play the Code Veronica.  Has the series evolved?  If you get past the improved graphics, the answer is NO.  The control is just as sloppy as it was in RE1, albeit with a quick turnaround feature and a new two-handed gun mode (you burn through bullets faster this way).  A great deal of prior planning and trial and error is required, which may have been good back when the series was young, but it has simply gotten to be tedious today.
Even the soundtrack is pretty forgettable!  The game has a rather cartoonish look to it...could have looked more realistic but then again, the Dreamcast isn't exactly a graphics powerhouse.  My suggestion...don't buy it.  Granted, I've owned this game for quite some time and those who are new to DC may have heard great things about CV, but trust me, this is a BORING game!  Get Shenmue instead as that game simply plays better and has a better story!
