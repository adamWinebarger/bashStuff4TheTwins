Although the Final Fantasy series was pretty good, no other RPG can compare to this.
With a very long storyline, and if you don't have a strategy guide handy, there's a possibility that it might take a while to finish the game completely.
The features are just amazing. At some points, you are required to move into the future 7 years, where Link is a full-grown adult, and sometimes back 7 years to advance in your journey. As an adult, some things will have changed. And when day turns to night and vice versa, some things will change that will be different when compared to the same place, only in the daytime.
The battles are intense. And as for the boss battles, the bosses have a variety of options that they can do, and to effectively defend, you usually have to be prepared for any "curves" that they throw at you.
Legend of Zelda: OoT holds a lot of replay value. Even after I've finished the game, I'm still having a great time.
Overall, Legend of Zelda: OoT is probably one of the best RPGs available. Would be definitely worth buying and would also make a wonderful gift!
