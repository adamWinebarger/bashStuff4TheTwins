We bought this after the Pokemon Go craze hit and we wanted to play the original red/blue games on our Gameboy.  Perhaps it is just because it is so old but it seemed to run out of batteries very quickly so we wanted a charger.  It does it's job but my complaint is that if it gets unplugged while playing your unit will turn off.  I had it happen a few times and I hadn't saved in a while which was frustrating.  If you are using this while playing save often!
