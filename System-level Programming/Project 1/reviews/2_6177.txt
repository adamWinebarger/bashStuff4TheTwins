This was always bound to be a great title, the Quake name is like a way of printing money! but this time I am just not buying it! I don't have a very high spec PC and Quake 3 just runs like a dog! (it's a AMD K6-2 350 with  128Mb of RAM and an ATI Rage Magnum with 32Mb) my message to people out  there with this spec of PC or below, don't bother with Q3, there is a very  good alternative "Unreal Tournement" it's a brilliant title that  runs sweet on my machine in 800x600 in 32 BIT colours (colors!). In summery  Q3 Great title, but you will need an ass kicking spec.
