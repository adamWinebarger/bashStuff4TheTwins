I bought this thinking that an 8MB card would be to small. So I figured getting a larger one would be alright. I was wrong. One of the problems is that it hardly works. There is one main causes to this.
 The casing in incorrect. It's too loose to fit properly and make a clean connection to the contacts. This results in the PS2 recognizing the card about 2% of the time.

So don't buy this. Just go get an official 8MB. Besides 8MB will go a long way.
