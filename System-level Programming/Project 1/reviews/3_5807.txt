This was the first MK game to be in 3D,using motion capture technology. When I first played this game I did not like it. I could not grasp the new idea that Midway had with this game. Over time though,it kinda grew on me. This game included some klassic MK characters,along with a few new faces too. The fatalities here were all done in 3D,just as the gameplay. This Playstation port is decent,but not great. Far from it actually. The textures on the characters are pretty bad. The characters look a bit blocky and the gameplay can be a bit choppy at times. Another problem is this game loads ALOT.Overall though,this port of MK4,is just okay at best. If you got a Sega Dreamcast,pick up Mortal Kombat Gold instead. It's the same as MK4,but it has extras. Such as bringing back characters,Baraka,Mileena,Kitana,Kung Lao and Cyrax. Plus the graphics are ALOT better. They are very smooth. Pick that up instead if you can. If you just own a Playstation/Playstation 2,you might like this too. Just don't pay too much
