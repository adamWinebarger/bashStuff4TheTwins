I have had this game since it came out. too many people see this as a bad/old game, but i remember when this first came out...it was  revolutionary. this was the ORIGINAL game to use the engine, while attitude  was a sequel, and ECW just plain copied it. If you have a choice, though,  you should buy it's sequel, attitude.
