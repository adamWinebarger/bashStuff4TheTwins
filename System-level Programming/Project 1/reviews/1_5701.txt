This game is more fun than having a bag of hammers dropped on your head, but not by much. A game where you rely on stealth and not your trigger finger is a good idea but I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING. I knew that I was in trouble on the very first mission. It went like this:  Me: "Where am I? Is this a wall or a door? I'll just open it-" Guard: "Hey!" Me: "Oops!" Guard kills me. The End.
Wow. That was fun. Hoo-boy!
