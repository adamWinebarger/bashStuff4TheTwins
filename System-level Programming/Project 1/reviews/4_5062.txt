This is a great game to play with a friend or two or more. It's still fun to play it by yourself but it's definately better as a multiplayer game. This game is pretty addicting, so if you have alot of time to kill this is the perfect game for you. Hopefully there will be an upgraded version for this on the Playstation 3 but I highly recommend this game.
