Alright, I don't like this one as much as World Tour, but this is a solid game in and of itself. You have three basic monsters to chose from (Rhino, Rat, and Crab) and you set off to unlock the original three monsters (Gorilla, Wolf, and Lizard). You can actually save in this game and progress through the story unlike the pick-up-and-play nature of World Tour and there is a secret character to unlock. This is a good game for kids and a better game for kids who like a challenge.

That said, older kids will get bored. It is repedative and monotonous at times. Your kids will likely tire of the music and play something else. But for what it is worth this is a solid entry. Get it if you are on a budget and your kids like to see monsters eat sprites for a few moments.
