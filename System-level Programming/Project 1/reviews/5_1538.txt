This is one of the best Mario games I've ever played. The game starts out when Mario gets a letter from Peach to come to the castle. Mario is so excited he rushes to the castle. When he gets inside he hears a voice that tells him to scram, and that's when his adventure begins. The first world is very easy but then they start getting more diffucult as you progress. The thing that makes this better than any other mario game is that you have more enemies, stars to collect, a race with a penguin and much more. If you don't have it yet, buy it!
