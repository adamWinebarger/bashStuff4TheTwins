Resident Evil: Code Veronica.

This was originally released on the Dreamcast and originally intended to be the third of the Resident Evil series. However, that went to what we now know as the excellent Nemesis game for playstation.

This game was the first to be set in full 3D with no pre-rendered backgrounds. This game has held up very well and the graphics are more polished on the PS2 and gamecube versions.

It follows the story of Claire Redfield after the events of Resident Evil 2 and also reintroduces us to one of the heroes from the original game, Chris Redfield. It features new enemies, weapons and entirely new locations.

Something about the location didn't set right with me. Oh, I know...it's not Raccoon City. Well, I guess they couldn't help that after Nemesis, but still.

I say this is where Resident Evil started to go down hill. That doesn't mean this is a bad game, but this doesn't feel as fresh as the others before it, who still play great in 2009. I'd recommend this as it is better than Resident Evil Zero, 4 and much better than 5.
