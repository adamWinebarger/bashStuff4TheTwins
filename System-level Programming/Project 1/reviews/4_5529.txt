I'm giving this game 4 Stars out of the "gate" because it's pretty much just like "M&M 6" and that's definitely a good thing. M&M 6 in my opinion is one the the best in the series and so far 7 has got me wanting to continue more of the late night session i spent with it's predicessor. Oh, and by the way, if you are having trouble getting this game to run,read on a few reviews down,( if you are reading the reviews in order of the 'date reviewed') you'll see a very simple solution shared by one of the reviewer's that works. Fret not,the game does run on XP,you'll just have to have a little 'Know How' and a little patience.-----Darvius7
