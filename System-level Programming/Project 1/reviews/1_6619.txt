Totally hate this game.  Maybe it's because I'm over 30 and have very little patience for action platformer video games these days?  I don't know, but this game is exceptionally frustrating, to say the very least.  And I grew up on the old Nintendo, Super Mario platforming days.  This game is nothing like that.  It's extremely difficult, to the point where it does nothing to help my temper issues.  If you want to seriously throw your controller down the block, then get this game.  Otherwise, please do yourselves a favor and pass it up.  You don't need the aggravation in your life.
