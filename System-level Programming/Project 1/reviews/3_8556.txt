Diddy Kong Racing is an awesome concept: an adventure game mixed with a racing game. Throw in some cute characters, cool bosses, three different vehicles, huge racing courses and some sweet secrets and you've got yourself an awesome game, right? Well...yes and no.
I loved this game when I was a kid. Diddy Kong Racing was the first game I bought for the N64 (in fact, it was the reason I purchased an N64). I played this non-stop then, beating the entire game, unlocking all the secrets, then beating the whole game again. Then I moved onto different games, and DKR fell by the wayside.
So, a few days ago, I decided to pop it in, for the nostalgia factor (and also to see if it was still any fun). I started a new game, and found the first track. So far, I was having fun, probably due to the nostalgia, but so far so good. Then I got into my first race. I was greeted by horrible controls- it felt like my character was sliding along on ice. I managed to finish the race in first place, soundly beating my CPU opponents, even with the controls. I thought to myself "This isn't how I remember DKR...maybe I'll play some more." So, I play for a few more hours, beating the world and the level boss. The controls have gotten slightly better, but are still very loose. The cheesy music is grating on my nerves, as are the annoying super-cutesy characters. I finally turn the game off, deciding too let my fond memories of the game remain intact.
In 1997, Diddy Kong Racing was revolutionary. Today, it stands as a failed idea. Still, I hope that some developer can take the basic idea of DKR and craft a decent kart racer around it. I really like the adventure game aspects of DKR; but the poor multiplayer and the loose controls are huge turn-offs. Ultimately, you'd be better off buying Mario Kart 64 if you need a racing game for your N64. I give DKR points for originality; it's just that the execution is way off the mark.
