Zelda Ocarina of Time is a fantastic game,the different worlds are well made,the day and night thing is very nice,the characters are great,(I actually hated the bad guy),including the horse to move inside the different worlds is a good idea and the music is beautiful,my husband was always with his back at the tv,because he uses to use the computer when I play games and he just couldn't believe how good the music is,he kept turning and looking to see what was I playing with such music,you do feel that you are in a fantasy world playing this game,wich I thought it was very cool,and aren't those little fairies cute?.
Really,I recommend this game,no matter what kind of game genre is that you play,you'll love this one!!.
