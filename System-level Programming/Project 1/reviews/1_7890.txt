I bought DK64 when it first came out in 1999, and from the moment I started to play it I did not like it at all. It is way too complicated and difficult to play, and I would not recommend this game. Every time I tried to play it I just kept getting frustrated, and I had to stop playing it. Instead I would recommend Banjo-Kazooie or Mario 64.
