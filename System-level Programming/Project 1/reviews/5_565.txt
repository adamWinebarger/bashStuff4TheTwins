They took what was great about the first and somehow made it twice as good. These games are still great for people looking for a challenge, but I would advise first-time players to play the series in order, as each game builds up from the hardest point of the previous one by making difficult-to-learn skills from the previous one rudimentary things you NEED to know in order to play the next, as well as adding a bunch of new tricks and surprises. But, even though there isn't as much actual "Tomb Raiding" in this one, it is definitely a step up from the previous version. Also includes an awesome bonus level at the end where Lara's house is raided by a Mafia strike team. Although, does not include the other bonus levels from the extended version of the game. (The extended version has two more levels, but it's only for the PC)
