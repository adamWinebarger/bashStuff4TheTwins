Despite my liking for gore and profanity, this game leaves for something... I would say gameplay value. When I first started playing it, I enjoyed the nice Quake 2 based engine and the 3D Audio, but it quickly got me saying, "Why am I playing this?"
I understand the plot clearly, you want to become the Boss (the Kingpin) and you have to fight through gangs and other obstacles to get there. These obstacles include ridiculous missions of running back of and forth doing favors. Such as giving a bum some whiskey to get a combination safe number. I thought if a game has a Mature rating slapped onto it, it might as well have some Mature thinking puzzles...
The profanity is something that probably turns away most audiences, because most of the gamers are young and probably need parental admission to get games. To me, the profanity is interesting to hear, not annoying or disturbing. I have never seen a game so daring to use so much violence (until Soldier of Fortune) and profanity.
All in all, I would suggest anyone who likes graphic violence in gang-related environments and non-stop profanity.
