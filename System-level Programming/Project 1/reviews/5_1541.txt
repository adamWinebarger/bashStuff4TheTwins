Super Mario 64(1997) When I first got Nintendo 64,it came with Super Mario 64. When the system was hooked up,I put in the game,and was amazed on how the graphics were! It was excellent. The graphics were great,the music was cool,and Mario never looked better! This game is for everyone. I thought Banjo-Kazooie was a great game,but move over Banjo,Mario is back! The best game ever. Features new worlds,characters,setting,and don't worry some of the old villians from the early Mario games are here,and can't forget Bowser and Princess Toadstool(Peach).Better than any 64 game ever made!
