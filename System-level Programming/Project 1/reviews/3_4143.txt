This game is not a nice arcade style Sim game at all.  What I do like about the Blitz football games though is its ease of gameplay for most  players.  Anyone can pick this little game up and play it for a while.  It  to me makes a nice two player game. Pull it out when you got a few pals  over your place and it makes for a good bit of fun.  Dont try Blitz however  if you are looking for a game to keep realistic seasons and stats, try  Gameday if you are in that Market instead.
