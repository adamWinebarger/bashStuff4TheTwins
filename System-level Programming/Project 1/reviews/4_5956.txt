This game is so fun and funny. I got this game for my birthday a few weeks ago and i loved. It so funny with the one liners from dana gould. But I am warning you do not let people under the age of at least 8 to play because it has bad words in it. My game kept saying the D word over and over and over. I have a five year old brother and he heard the d word and he said over and over and over. I am warning you this game is really fun and funny but don't let little kids play it or even listen to it. But for sure this game is much better than Croc and Croc2.
