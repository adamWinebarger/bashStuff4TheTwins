Link, the courageous hero of time, must save Hyrule and Princess Zelda from the powerful wizard Ganandorf. Along the way Link will meet many people who can help him on his quest, as well as provide items and host mini-games to make it more fun. Can Link defeat Ganondorf and save the Triforce? Buy this game and become part of the adventure! Travel through time to play both child and adult Link. Ocarina of Time never gets boring or tedious, and is neither too hard nor too easy for any level of gaming skill. If you missed it in 1998, it's time to get it and get in on the action! The sequel, Majora's Mask, is also cool.
