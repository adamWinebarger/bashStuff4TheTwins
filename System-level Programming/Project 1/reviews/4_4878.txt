Let me start out by saying I waited some time until purchasing this software because of the bad reviews.  I'm a huge fan of the first two games but decided to hold off on this one until the price dropped.  (Something about not having Sid Meier's name in the title.)
I have to tell you though I was impressed by what I saw.  Perhaps it was because I was expecting a terrible sequel but Call to Power (Civ 3) is a better surprise compared to Civilization 2.  There are more changes and the game is more complex.  As a matter of fact, I find this game more challenging than the previous two.
Now don't let this review get you enthusiastic about the game because on the same token, you might be disappointed with the sequel.  There are gameplay problems such as a new macro economy that doesn't seem to have been well planned out by the designers, no scenarios or predesigned maps (specifically, the world map), a combat system that leaves you in disbelief when your M-16 soldiers are wiped out by cowboys, etc...  I was also disappointed by the new wonders (I'm not sure how the copyright worked out with the new company, but I felt the old wonders were more logical.  An example is the sphinx instead of the pyramids.) that seemed to disappear quick (as far as their effects) because technology is obtained so easilly.
If an overhaul of the game was in store, I feel that the designers could have put more technologies into the game as well as a better variety of attack/defense units considering it covers so much time.  (2000BC - 3000AD?)
But the price is right for this game at this time.  Now that the Call to Power sequel is out, I would recommend this game to see if you enjoy the new format.
