do have no life?do you enjoy wandering aimlessly through hundreds of tiny dark rooms looking for switches only all the rooms look exactly alike?got a lot of time on your hands?then this is the game for you.the weopons rule! of course unless you cheat they're never there when you need them.the fighting and shooting up dinosaurs is cool but all the wandering and guessing sucks.i had the most fun just cheating by putting in stuff to make all the weopons there and all of them infinitely loaded.even with total immunity to death youll still just search and search and still won't beat it.unless you're infinitely patient.
