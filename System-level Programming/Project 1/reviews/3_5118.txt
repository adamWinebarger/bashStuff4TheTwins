Baldur's Gate has a terrific real time engine, where you get to see everything from what weapon or item your character is wielding to the unique spell effect an image is using. Except for a few bugs easily fixed by a patch, the game's engine is exquisite, and provides the best electronic RPG system that I've seen.
The only flaw for me is the fact that the game is essentially a hackfest. While an epic and intriguing plot is included, the real villain spends most of his time hiding behind his lackeys to the point where, despite a brief appearance at the beginning, you go through 100 hours of dungeons and monsters just to speak to him. There is almost no dialogue or character interaction, and the final few battles turn out to be an exercise in how many monsters you can summon rather than an opportunity to utilize real strategies.
While the combats are entertaining to a point, I prefer more story-intensive games such as Final Fantasy or Planescape: Torment. But at the same time, this game does provide an excellent setup for it's sequel, and Baldur's Gate II improves on everything the original does wrong. If you like combat, or if you want to get the whole saga, you will want to pick up Baldur's Gate.
