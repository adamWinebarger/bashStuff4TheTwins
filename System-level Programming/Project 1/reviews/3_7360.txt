I'm gonna make this review short and simply say check out UMK3, its really like an improved version of this game.

This game has good graphics, good music, and decent character selection. You can play as the 2 boss characters with some kinda cheat during the options menu, that's a plus. But the game is just to weak by comparison. It lacks a lot of little things Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3 has to offer. The gameplay isn't bad but with some better control options that could have really been improved.

Its not a horrible game, but there are better ones like UMK3 and also other games out there that would make more sense of your time!
