This is the 2nd best Nintendo 64 game to date right behind Golden Eye 64. We all know that Golden Eye 64 is impossible to top, but this comes damn near close.
Zelda Ocarina of Time is a classic. Five stars plus. Matter of fact this is the best Zelda release I have ever played. And I have played them all.
The graphics really show what the Nintendo 64 is capable of putting out along with other classics like Mario 64 and Golden Eye. The graphics are amazing and are top notch.
The storyline is even better. Most good RPGs have more than just one single character. This game however only has Link and still manages to become a classic like most of the other Zelda titles. No this game is no Final Fantasy IIV, but in a way this game is better. Maybe not as long, but the storyline is a little bit more creative and catchy.
Ocarina of Time offers a little bit more "extras" than the previous Zelda titles have to offer. You can collect extra items along the way for personal score to see how good your discovering ability is, and not just finding pieces of hearts. There are so many secrets with this game.
I would suggest you don't use the strategy guide until you have completed the game. If you do, then you are cheating yourself and making the game not even worth playing. Beat the game and then look at the guide to see what you have missed.
Overall, I spent a lot of time on this game. I could have beaten it a lot faster, but that wouldnt be any fun, because the fun part is discovering the secrets within the game itself.
Buy the game and see for yourself. This isn't exactly a hard challenge of a game, but it isn't exactly that simple either. Just right. Get it today!
