When I first got the game, it was "Wow", thinking it would be the best.  I have to admit, it is better than some games I have already played, but it just didn't have the zing of the other C&C games.
The computer stinks.  I could beat them playing as GDI(good guys), which is hard because NOD(bad guys) has all the best vehicles, units, and structures.  I love the Missile Silo.  Talk about blitzcrieg on your opponent!!  If you want to have about a 65% chance of winning, stick with NOD.
I wouldn't recommend the missions, because they are all too easy or all too hard.  I stick to skirmish and internet games myself.
I might venture to say that it is worth an inexpencive look.  Maybe even borrowing it from a friend.
All-in-all, I would have to say that the graphics are superb, stories are bad,  sound is so-so, and gameplay is dependant on which side you choose(NOD being better).
