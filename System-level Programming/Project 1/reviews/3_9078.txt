Donkey Kong Land is a pretty decent game, but it lacks the overall magic of the DK Country games on the SNES.  It is your basic side scroller adventure game.  The play control is good and the challenge decent.  You can use the animal friends like the Rhino and Dolphin.  But once you play through it, the game does not have that much replay value to it.  I really missed the barrel shooting like in the SNES version.  I get the limitations of the Gameboy system but it would have been nice to see in the game.

DK Land does have all new levels designs so you are playing a totally different game.  Most of the characters will be familiar with the same strengths and weaknesses.  The battery save feature is nice being able to save your progress.  I found the game pretty easy overall.  It just seemed to me it needed a better reward or incentive to play through the game again.  In DK Country getting that 101% was a nice way to keep playing the game.

What disappointed me most was the cheap ending.  I hate it when you invest your time in a game and all you get at the end is a cheap "Congratulations" with credits. It would have been nice to see a parade of characters like they do in the Mega Man games or just a nice snap shot like at the end of Donkey Kong for Gameboy.  Or like the Wario Land games your ending will be determined how many bananas you were able to collect and find making your way through the game.  I would rate DK Land 3 stars it is pretty average.  I would save your money and buy DK Country for Gameboy Color or just buy Donkey Kong for Gameboy.  The classic Donkey Kong game for Gameboy has a lot more replay value than this one and a much better challenge.
