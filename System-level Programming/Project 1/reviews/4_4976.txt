When Quake 2 originally hit the PC, it's unabashed violence and surprisingly addictive gameplay not only outshined it's predecessor, it killed it before it hit the ground.  The PS1 and N64 conversions took much longer than expected to be released, and fans of the PC game anxiously awaiting the home versions were a little worried about the quality of the home system versions.  When Quake 2 hit the PS1, those fears were dead in the dirt.  Activision, Hammerhead, and Id all did a fantastic job bringing Quake 2 to the PS1 while keeping a surprisingly smooth frame rate (although the graphics aren't as good as its PC counterpart, but that was expected) and the unabashed violent addictive gameplay remains intact.  The game makes excellent use of the PS1's Dual Shock controller; the controls are easy and every button is to be used.  While some parts can be frustrating and the game has a rather steep learning curve, Quake 2 is still undeniably fun.  Those still holding on to they're PS1's can find this bad boy at a rather cheap price and have a great time with this near classic FPS.
