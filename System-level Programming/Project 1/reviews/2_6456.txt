Final Fantasy 8 is the worst of the entire final fantasy series.
As far as game play goes it holds up poorly. Getting new items equip is not a part  of the system even though you can get items to upgrade your weapons nothing  gets done about armor. Levels were pointless your increase was only a  slight one. The monsters did profit a lot from the levels you gained though  and you would easily be at level 99 halfway threw the game. The game  doesn't have many characters and the characters within don't have as much  personality is they did in FF7. The only mini-game within it is a poorly  done card game that gets boring fast. The GF system seems nice at first but  quickly you find out that spending an hour getting the max amount of  something is an easy way to over become powered and takes a lot of time.  The only real control over your characters power level is how much patience  you have for getting more spells into your GFs.
As far as plot goes this  game also hold up poorly to other games. It may start off fine but to avoid  revealing too much I'm just going to say by the second CD its going in a  bad direction and it doesn't turn around. Characters never get as  interesting as they were in FF7 and when you're on the third CD. (I think)  You well hit the one plot stop that leaves only the strong of heart to  actually bother finishing this sorry excuse for an RPG.
The graphics are  only strong point this game has. They are absolutely beautiful. Defiantly  the best ever for when it was made. You may end up summoning GFs you don't  want to summon just to see the pictures they show when summoned.
And  finally as far as length of time it can stay interesting it's a long game  but its only interesting for about 4 hours into the game. If you need it  it's length is one you well need a long time to beat.
Overall this game  is not worth buying unless you really like pretty pictures.
