I reviewed this game a while back on the Genesis, and yeah its not one of the better Batman games that's 4 sure! With a few minor differences in sound and landscape design of the levels this game is almost identical to the Genesis version, and that being said your in for a lot of headaches.

The set up of this game is very unique. The gameplay mechanics resemble something from Mortal Kombat or other fighting games, but its actually a walkthrough/beat-em up style action game though. You can choose as Batman or Robin, and of course with the option of having a 2 player mode as well. Like the Genesis version they use real live digitized footage of actors for the sprites in the game so it looks pretty good overall. That is also where a lot of the pros end on this game, the rest are cons!

First off its extremely hard not just because of the constant barrage of enemies you face but the controls I think may have been designed by a programmer with a really bad sense of humor! The characters do not respond and sometimes feel glitchy and too perform the easiest of moves it takes a very odd button combination. So fighting the constant flow of enemies is super annoying and frustrating! And also the SNES is known for having great soundtracks and sound quality in its games, not here, there are literally 2 tracks through out the game! 0_o

The Adventures of Batman and Robin on The Sega Genesis is a great Batman game, and its port on the SNES isn't too shabby either, check out one of them but avoid this one!
