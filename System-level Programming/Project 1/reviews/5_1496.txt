Every now and then a start this game up from scratch and go seeking the 120 stars and the battles with Bowser.  What makes this game so fun is that even though you master it there are several stars that are just so hard to get again (I don't know how many times I need to race the penguin down the chute before I can get one of the tougher stars).

I really love the music and the toughness of Mario as he beats the baddies into submission with kicks, punches and smashes.  Though the graphics may pale by today's standards they seemed so far ahead of their time when the game was introduced (it was one of the first 3-D graphic games around).

I never tire of it.
