THE BEST N64 GAME. It's easy, difficult to totally master, and is fun to play again and again. The bosses are creative and original, and the dungeons are fun and easy. Storyline is pretty good, better than the "save the princess" generalization it's often given. The characters are a quiet hero of time, an eternally youthful forest girl, a wild rock man from the firey Death Mountain, a rebellious fish woman, a determined royal guard, a sexy thief, the "princess", and of coure, Ganon the bad guy.
