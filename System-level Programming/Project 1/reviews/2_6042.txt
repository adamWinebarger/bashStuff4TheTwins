I can see how some folks would enjoy a pure arcade version with no reality whatsoever involved.  Myself, I think I'd like something more realistic.
First downs are 30 yards, there are no penalties, there's no kickoff, and there is no realism involved as far as athletic ability of the players.  For example, if you complete a pass from Young to Rice (remember, this is 2000!), and Rice has the open field, two defenders are actually able to catch up to Rice and tackle him.  This is flat out ridiculous, even for an arcade game.  Ditto Terrell Owens and Tim Brown, and I was able to stop other wideouts with linebackers just by squeezing the turbo button.
The emphasis is obviously on bone-crushing tackles, but after an hour of play, the only really enjoyable aspect of this is the ability to cheap-shot the offensive players long after the ball is whistled dead.  The field-goal kicking system is particularly vexing, as it was apparently designed by a chimp with ADD, and requires eight espresso-mochacchinos in order to maintain the twitch focus required to accurately split the uprights.
Overall, I see this as a fun arcade game for younger kids not up to simulation-level gameplay, and guys/gals who just want to have fun beating each other's players up.  Me, if I want to beat up some guy, I'll play Soul Calibur.
