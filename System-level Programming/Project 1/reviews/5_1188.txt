I love this game.  I love this game.  I love this game.  I just got Ocarina of Time and it's been a few years since it has come out - it still rocks even in comparison to what's out now.  I've had a Playstation 2 for a couple of years and have had a good game here and there, but after playing Ocarina of Time, I realize that I had forgotten the beauty of Nintendo games.  They just have a special feel to them (and they make me remember the years that I was a little tike playing old Nintendo games).  I just beat the game about 5 minutes ago.  I certainly won't spoil anything, but I will tell you that the ending is over 30 seconds long and is something worth playing through the game to see...  A video game hasn't brought me this level of satisfaction in a while.  Bravo Nintendo, bravo.
