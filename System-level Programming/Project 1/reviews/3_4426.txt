I bought Roller Coaster Tycoon because it looked interesting, and the option to build roller coasters reminded me of Disney's old game Coaster.  I played it for a while and bought the expansion pack, but it just didn't hold my attention.
When I bought it, it looked like a game for all ages, but after playing it for a while it really seemed like it was designed for kids, not adults. The whole nausea feature with guests vomiting all over really got old after a while. Also, the graphics aren't bad, but there's no variation in the guests, they all look like bald men, even the staff.
Once you've played all the scenarios, there's no more, and there isn't a "create your own" and just play option, everything has a scenario. You can keep playing them after you've won them, but you're limited to the land and the setup of that scenario.
The speed is also an issue, you either have go or stop, there's no way to slow down or speed up time, and most scenarios require a time limit, like a year or three years.  Unfortunately, if you've won the scenario at the end of year one of a three year scenario, you're stuck. You have to wait out the next two years, and there's no way to set the game at a top speed so it will end faster.  The opposite is true as well, if you're almost out of time and haven't met the conditions, you can't slow down the game to help you plan things out.
On the good side, the general graphics look nice, you can figured the game out pretty well on your own, and there's a nice variety of roller coasters. You have plenty of things to play with in the game, but there's just enough to it that I wouldn't consider it a fantastic game.
