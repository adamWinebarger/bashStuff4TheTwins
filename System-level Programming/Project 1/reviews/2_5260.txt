This popular title has a lot going for it - good graphics, excellent maneuvering and physics, and style to boot.
However, the difficulty is much too high for even heardcore gamers. There seems to be something truly amiss with the makers of the game - despite the negative comments regarding gameplay, the game's sequel, Driver 2 (PSX) is actually harder than the original.
In order to make the game playable, you either have to apply a patch released by Infrogrames or play in cheat mode. Then it will become only _barely_ playable.
Unless you can find a cheap copy, avoid.
