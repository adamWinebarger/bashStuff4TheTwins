SIM THEME PARK is both complex and simple at once, which can get confusing.  It seems to be aimed at the grade school set, yet includes controls which end up being complex.  The 3D graphics are eye-poppingly fancy, and the rides and attractions are clever, but the theme parks don't seem real like they do in Roller Coaster Tycoon.  Nevertheless, this game is a fun addition to your sim library.
This game is equipped with a tutorial mode, which introduces us to an annoying little character who talks all the time, attempting to explain how each control works.  After I turned the tutorial-guy off, I found it much more pleasant to play this game in which you design a theme park complete with rides, sideshows, restaurants, a staff, and other attractions.
This game features parks with Disneyland-worthy themes such as Halloween (coffin restrooms!) and Prehistory (think a kinder, gentler Jurassic Park), which have clever rides and attractions.
One really cool feature is the "ride it" option which allows you to see your ride from the perspective of someone who is on the ride.  You can also see things from the perspective of security cameras.  This is fun, but the novelty wears off.
I enjoyed checking out the various types of theme parks in this game, which you get to play by earning golden keys (for reaching certain goals) but I ended up going back to Roller Coaster Tycoon, which I think is a superior game.  I give this game 3 stars for anyone over 12, but possibly more stars for anyone younger.
