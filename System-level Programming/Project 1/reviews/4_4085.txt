There's weird hybrids, and then there's "The Misadventures of Tron Bonne", which might best be described as a combination of single-player "Mario Party" with the inventorty and character  interaction of a "Final Fantasy" game.  But that description  misses two important factors: wanton plunder and CUTE LITTLE  SERVBOTS!
The goal of the game is to collect one-million zenny (a Capcom  monetary unit) to pay off the Bonne family debts.  The young,  morally-unencumbered Tron is a mechanical whiz, so she sets off in the  mighty ship Gesselschaff with its robotic crew to raise the funds the  old-fashioned way: by stealing them.
The four major modes in the title  are mini-games: two variants on dungeon-crawling, a puzzle section, and a  3-D platform shootout.  Tron, usually piloting her mechanical mobile suit,  Gustaff, is assisted by 40 cute-as-a-button "servbots".  The  great thing about the servbots is their absolute innocence in the service  of piracy -- it's hilarious to blow the doors off a house, send in the  servbots, and watch them run out yelling "yay!", their arms full  of loot.
The servbots have distinct personalities, and unique skills that  can be unlocked by giving each a unique object.  They can also improve  their core skills by playing still more mini-games aboard the ship.  And  for servbots that get lazy, there's a torture room where you're challenged  to spike, torch, and flatten naughty servbots.
It's a peculiar mix, but  open-minded gamers will love this title...
