Unlike the Corny ninja titles of years past like "Ninja Gaiden," "Ninja," and others of that manner.  Tenchu finally takes the  Ninja game to the next level.  Not just a run around and throw stars at  senseless, weak enemies, this game forces you to learn and master stealth  and the art of sneak attack.  The different weapons available keep the  onslaught more versatile, and the different sword attacks seem to stun the  viewer with there harsh and brutal images.  A great game , a great story  line, but still a few small problems.  even though you have a large variety  of weapons they are very limited.  some of the game may be confusing, and  not very straight forward as to what you are supposed to do, and you tend  to run into some very annoying camera views that seem to definately take  away from the game play.  But overall it's a very entertaining game which  i recommend to any action fan.
