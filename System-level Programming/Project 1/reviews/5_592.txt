I played this game a lot when I was little. It was always fun and I enjoyed it. The music in the background, the colors, the graphics; its all great. The coolest thing is that this game is one of a kind, and it is really a good one to add to any Nintendo 64 collection. Gameplay is easy and overall a really awesome game!
