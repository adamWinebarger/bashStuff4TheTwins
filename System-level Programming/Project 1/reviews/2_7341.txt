I like the original Batman game for this system as oppose to this joke. The graphics are very good I will say that, but terrible gameplay. The fighting system in this game was different and it was more than just a rock'em sock'em still side scroller. I liked how each of the characters had a huge list of moves; and how you can use them in the dual mode. Despite this being a bad game overrall I remember myself and my brother loved playing this game back in the day. It was cool when I was a pre-teen but now its just one of those stale games.
