I love Sarge's Heroes, but Sarge's Heroes 2 is not my favorite. I ordered the first one in it's "original" box. What I got was Sarge's Heroes 2 in a custom aftermarket Sarge's Heroes 1 box. The first edition of this game is more valuable than the second and I paid for the first. I reported the problem and they asked me to ship it back to them, however the shipping and handling outweighs the weight of the game as a whole, so I suppose I just got the crappy end of the stick...
