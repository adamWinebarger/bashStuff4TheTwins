I got a good deal on this game.  I purchased it ... at a local retailer and the thought 'if it sucks i'm not out much' went through my mind.  I brought it home and installed it not expecting much out of this game.  Once I started playing though I was blown away.  This is a great game in the spirit of Diablo 2 and Nox.  You start out as a revenant, a resurrected spirit with no recollection of your past.  You must fight an evil cult and rescue the king's daughter, at least I think he was a king, i didn't really pay much attention because the dialogue is annoying in this game.
Aside from the annoying dialogue, and it is very annoying, the rest of the game rocks.  The way spells are cast is interesting and different from normal games where scrolls are memorized or written in a magic book.  The melee combat is good because your character has 4 different attacks instead of the one slash attack in Diablo 2.  Granted he can't learn a whirlwind attack or leap attack but who cares?  That's not realistic anyway.
The graphics and sound are both very good.  The only problem is sometimes I have difficulties picking up items off the ground, especially if they are hidden behind the leaves of a tree.  Also, sometimes you will get stuck behind a rock or the edge of a fence line and it takes a bit to get unstuck, but you never remain there forever.
I also like the way I can see enemies on my map so if my health is very low and I have no food or potions I can avoid them, making my way back to town.
This game is worth as much as $36.95.  I might have given it a few more dollars if it weren't for the annoying dialogue.
