Sim City 3000 is good game, yet it is the hardest game I have ever played. The main problem is getting money. I can never get any profit at the end of each year. Sure, I can use the $100,000 cheat code, but it only works once. Another problem is getting the people to work. Even if you put residential areas (where they live) next to industrial areas (where they work), they still might complain that it is too far to go. Some good things about Sim City 3000 is that you can build famous landscapes. Also, the graphics are great! If you are considering buying this city-building game, I would suggest The Sims or Roller Coaster Tycoon instead.
