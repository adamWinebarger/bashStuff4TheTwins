Its never reissued it doesn't seem !..or else there would be cheaper used copies for common people out there? why only the machines reissued but not the games..then everyone fights over few available copies?? urr disappointing..only ones out there are like 200.00 of some games that are classics..like was so hard to find a copy of  just Mario kart even I finally found a Japanese super famicon which I found out luckily worked on my retro duo super nes/nes console..but geez.. please reissue the classics to make them easier to find to buy??
