Another one of square softs RPG but certainly not one of there best. On the other hand it is quite challenging and most certainly long.
You have your choice of 7 differn't characters with 7 differn't stories. Red, Blue, Asellus, Riki, Tz60G, Lute and Emelia. Varying from mage, to robot and even a couple of just plain fighters.  Each one has its own storyline and missions, with its own ending.
PROS: Graphics and music go together nicely, Challenging and interesting storylines. One of its strongest points is the combo's your characters can do. As you select which tactic of battle you want each member of your party to do it can create combos that can inflict serious amounts of damage. Saving anyplace is one of the best things about this game!
CONS: With over 140 hours of game play it gets very repeditive. Granted each character has differn't story lines, most end up taking the same quests.  A bit on the dull side after you have beat a few of the heros.
In a nutshell this is a good game. Certainly one that I recomend you beat one character or even two, then put it away for a while so you don't become sick of it.
