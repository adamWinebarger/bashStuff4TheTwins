No matter how many times you beat this game you still want to play it again and again. Its because its tons of fun to get stars but also because the graphics are extremely well done and take up almost all of the system's power. Every level is great and the graphics are still awesome up to this day. In fact I like the visuals in this game more than some of the games for the 128 bit Game Cube including Super Mario Sunshine. The game play is very simple and easy but still manages to never lose a player's interest. I like to think of Super Mario 64 as a visually breathtaking masterpiece. The graphics are so awesome and the gameplay is very addictive even if youve already beaten the game 30 times it just never gets old.
  Also I heard a rumor that there is going to be a sequal called Super Mario 128. I hope it is even better than Super Mario 64 with harder challenges and more levels. Lets hope it has some of the things we love about Mario 64 plus great new surprises.
