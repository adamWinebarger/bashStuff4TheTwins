This game stinks. Anyone who liked the intense and realistic qualities of the first Army Men game will be disappointed with this effort. The 2 player mode has been destroyed, the beautiful graphics and environments are gone, the fast and smooth control is gone, there are no more allies to assign for  attack or defense, the operation of hand grenades, bazookas and mortors is  inferior, in the one player mode the tank is not able to smash a wooden  fence. There is an annoying arrow at the feet of the character which points  you in the direction of the enemy thus taking the fun and suprise out of  setting ambushes, the global ban on land mines has reached this game as  players are not able to set mines. The sound effects have been emasculated,  no piercing death screams. No jeeps, no .50 caliber guns. This game must  have been designed for the N64 as it does not come close to living up to  the high standards of the 1st game (Army Men 3D)for the Playstation.  If you like combat reality games buy the  excellent Medal Of Honor, it is everything that this game is not.
