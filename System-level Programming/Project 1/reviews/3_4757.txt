One of the most entertaining flight "sims" I have ever played. This game has given me hours and hours of enjoyment -- especially online. Unfortunately, there are some perplexing and conflicting elements involved here. Although the game has a "realistic" setting, there are no stalls and/or spins during flight. The program allows a virtual "Red Baron" to do things with a plane that are simply against the laws of physics. Also, for all the detail the programmer(s) put into this game in many areas, the guys (and gals) -- for some reason -- dropped the ball in certain places. There is no weapons load-out screen for the planes, and there seems to be a never ending supply of crude rockets and bombs -- whether you want them or not (the bomb/rocket load doesn't seem to affect the performance of the planes). In "real life" these weapons are loaded as needed per each mission and then expended. Most importantly, the game only shows its true graphical splendor in the 3dfx Glide mode. My Geforce 3 card only allows software rendering (the ground looks like a Purina checkerboard). In summary, be careful -- this one is addicting as hell. (Also note that there is a good online community out there who are ready and willing to help new "pilots").
