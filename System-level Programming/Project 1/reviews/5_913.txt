I loved this game as a kid but my older brother took it with him when he moved out.  It works perfectly and arrived in due time.  I was worried ordering a used game because some I'd ordered from places in the past haven't worked, but have absolutely no complaints!

For any who want a review of the game itself:
Of all the games we played growing up this one stood out due to its creativity and its soundtrack.  I love the variation in the worlds, from wandering the beaches of Treasure Trove Cove to the snowy winter wonderland of Freezeezy Peak.  The characters are fun, and the "violence" is very child-friendly.  My mom enjoyed listening to us play it enough she went out and bought the soundtrack so she could listen on her own!
Hats off to the makers of this game, because the level of creativity and imagination that went into it was outstanding.
