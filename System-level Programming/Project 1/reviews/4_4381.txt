What can I say about this game? It was name PC Gamer's game of the year! The game is simply great! At first glance, it seems like your typical first person shooter, but once you start getting into the game, everything changes. It turns into a complete horror game. It's one of those games that if you play at night, will make you want to turn all the lights in the house on. The game gives you huge suprises, like little alien creatures jumping out at you from no where. Or dark corridors with things waiting to kill you on the other side. This game is great, and is perfect for anyones collection!
