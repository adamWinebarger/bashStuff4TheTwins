I have to say first, i love the idea of oblivion. And while i do find the game fun(ish) i cant help say some levels are way to complex. Remember the original zeldas lost woods? Yea. Way to much of going in circles somehow. I love the turok bosses. Sisters of despair being my favorite just because they sound bad ass! Never beat it without codes as it was way to hard to find wth i need to go. Cool guns. Love the cerebral bore! But in all not a game ill pick up and dusting off anytime soon. Havent played 3 or rage wars yet but the first is better overall. Save the blood and gore is intense being a nintendo game! If u haven't played and were a master at nes zelda games-this just might be a great one
