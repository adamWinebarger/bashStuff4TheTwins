This game is really fun and all, especially for those who love all of the old Mega Man games ( such as myself) but I was kinda dissapointed. I expected it to have more bosses and levels. Just like all the old ones, you chose your opponent and then fight him and get his ability, then chose another untill you beat them all. It has been like this sense the first one came out! However it is fun! In this game, you can actually upgrade your wepons and stuff, but the graphics arn't that much better then the Netendo versions ( Although there is a cartoon in the begining). If you're looking for long gameplay hours, this is NOT the game to buy! If you're lookng for "another Mega Man" then I would recamend it.
