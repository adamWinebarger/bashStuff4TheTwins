Today I posted a review for Silent Hill for the Sony Playstation in the interest of fairness I figured I'd post a review about Resident Evil. Like Silent Hill I played and beat the game within a week of it's initial launch. I didn't have alot of gripes about the game being as I was blown away by the very idea of a survival horror game. Let alone playing such a game for the first time in my long gaming history.

The music and graphics for this game are by no means good to todays standards. Back in the day as with Silent Hill they were top notch or very near it. As far as puzzles go, Resident Evil had both passable and challenging puzzles... nothing that took away from your gameplay or experience which was a nice touch.

As far as gameplay this Resident Evil game, Director's Cut, was my favorite up until Resident Evil 2 and more recent Resident Evil 4. As I said with Silent Hill neither game is better than the other but I would strongly recommend skipping this game for this system and get the Resident Evil Remake for Gamecube.

The remake enhanced not just the graphics but the over all story and appeal of Resident Evil, the original classic survival horror game. In closing I have to say that I graded this a 3 as I did with Silent Hill, they are two different kinds of scares and two different worlds but the graphics and dated sound leave me empty. All-in-all a must buy for any Resident Evil fanboy or person looking for a quick cheap thrill.
