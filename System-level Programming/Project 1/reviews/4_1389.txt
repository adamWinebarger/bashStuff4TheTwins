The game came in good shape not great but good. Still satisfied with my purchase though. Does work great just not a collector's choice. Not worth sending back  for the flaws it has but am only going to rate it 4 stars. It said like new condition but was not quite like that when received. Was packaged well but did not say fragile handle with care on it like others I have ordered. Still one of the best games of all times though.
