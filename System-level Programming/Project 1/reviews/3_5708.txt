I got this from Gamestop, for $5.00 used.  I kept wondering if it was good or bad.  Well it breaks down like this:
Pros:
-Great Graphics
-Great voice acting
-nice selection of weapons
-excellent storyline
-has a bit of comedy in it(Like when hana takes her towel off in front of a soldier, and Deke snaps his kneck)
Cons:
-Puzzles are COMPLICATED(I died, and tried many times trying to get them right)
-The inventory system takes too long for me to get a weapon, so I died sometimes, trying to get my favorite weapon
-After you play it the first time, there's no real thrill to play it the second time, unless you're trying to get the best ending on hard.
I still play this game when I want to, it's just that it's just not the same like the first time I played it, cuz I didn't know what was going to happen(I didn't use a guide because I didn't want to ruin the suprise, and man it was a painful long jurney)  If you like games like Silent Hill or Resident evilm I would definitly recomend this game, but rent it first.
peace
