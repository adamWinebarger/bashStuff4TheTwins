Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is one of my favorite games ever!  I just love the storyline and the characters,even though Link, Ganondorf and Zelda have been in all of the Zelda games, but this game is the best.  The original Legend of Zelda for the Nintendo was okay, but it felt like the game would NEVER end!  I recommend this game to fantasy lovers who also love the idea of a super villan an action-ready hero.  This is also one of Nintendo's classics.  Everything a fantasy story needs is right in this game.
