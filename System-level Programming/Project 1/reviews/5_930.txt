This was my second visit with Zelda after the original NES game. Wow. This game was SO ahead of its time in graphics, gameplay, story, everything. Seriously ground breaking stuff for when this game was released. I've played this game off and on for most of my life, first getting it around the time it was released.

It's proven to age VERY well and is fun decades after first discovering it. A genre defining game in a class all of its own. If you haven't played this game, get it.
