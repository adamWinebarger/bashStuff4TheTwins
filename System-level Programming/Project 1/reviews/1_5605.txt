I am going to make this short but true.  First off this game is HARD or at least what I played. this game is no Shoot them all like Quake 2 or anything.  I found this game Repugent.  I don't even want to try it again.  I don't care if you have 1000 weapons, if you can't beat the first stage  with Ease, then forget about the rest.  The Graphics in this game are  Dated back to the DOOM age.  This 5 year opus did not pan out like I  wanted.  I really thought John Romero actually had some skill but it seems  not.  The game might have good points but the save system (save only if you  have a crystal?) is an abomination.  This is a horrible idea which is seen  way too much in Console System games, but never should have made it to the  PC.  I admit Ion Storm Made has made a killer game (Deus Ex) but this one  is just a pile of turds.  Bargin Bin Box.  I also just want to close with  this.  We can now see the real genius behind Doom, and Doom 2, was John  Carmack, not John Romero.  Sorry about being rude and mean, but this game  is really horrible, and I just want to be honest.
