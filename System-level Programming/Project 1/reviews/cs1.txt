Too much delay and sensitivity out of this microphone for rb ps  Makes it unplayableI have the wii version and is HORRIBLE JUST LIKE YOU HIT AN OPPONENT WITH A SHELL PASS AND WITH NO ITEM THE CPU BOOSTS WAY AHAED HORRIBLESeriously its one of the worst games ever Terrible graphics especially compared to the PS Triples no voice acting boring puzzles and above all it stars a little fruity fairy boy who wears green panties and never hits on any of the babes in this game Plus why is the main villian black Thats racist

For a good Zelda game I recommend Link The Faces of Evil The Wand of Gamelon or Zeldas Adventuremario kart is not fun there is no secret characthers or secret placesi think I tried the game for an hour and was completly bored now i dont like racing games The producers should have tried a little harder on this game i was completly unsatifiedAbsolutely HorribleIt wasnt even Logitech  It was Konami and it froze my xbox one repeatedly when I unplugged it  These also sound horrible with Rock Band  compared to the mic the game comes withI found HalfLife to be somewhat interesting although it started to run thin by the ending levels Not many of the levels were amazing either Just long hallways small rooms and an occasional elevator shaft that you  climb up I like D games that let you be outside looking over vast plains  of enemies and obstacles HalfLife just didnt cut it in this  arena
Another thing that I found most disturbing was the extreme  goreviolence that is present throughout the game When your science  project goes wrong you walk out to find a scientist lying on the ground  with about  gallons of blood spread all over the walls and floor Were  the programmers just trying to be sick here or what When you reach the  levels in which you begin to fight the army grunts who are the best  enemies it gets even more grotesque If you let off an entire clip of  bullets at one guy expect to see a wall covered with blood Sure you can  turn it off but it does very little good The blood is still very  disturbing This is one aspect of the game that is extremely unacceptable  I am not a parent saying this either Im a teenager
Aside from the  violence and lack of interesting levels the game is pretty much void of  any lasting qualities If you want a weekend of pure hell both keeping you  stuck to your computer and grossing you out entirely then buy this game  Otherwise dont botherI have played this game before and it is very fun That is why I came to Amazon to order myself another copy of the game so that I could go back in time and enjoy a classic game However I bought it from the seller Warehouse Deals Inc and I did NOT get my game and there is no place for me to get in contact with them Watch OutIve bought and played ALL of the ANNO games since  and spent more hours than I can even count building massive empires with extremely complex trade routes I was thrilled to see another installment released but I absolutely will NOT pay for something that limits my hardware changes and installs

Wake up UBI look at all of your other software title reviews both here on Amazon and on gaming sites People are not as stupid as you think and will simply find a different game to fill their time with and throw their money at if their freedoms are inhibited by your software

By adding DRM youve actually promoted the use of piracy instead of reduced it because those that really do want to play it will find a wayI just wanna review out something no ones said yet

If you still ever play this game it is a great game its  stars provided your into this sort of thing

But recently when i played the playstation version i noticed they jibbed out and didnt include certain things that the PC version and better version had

First off  There is no train The PC version has a fully working train that you can hijack and even put into reverse sure it may be useless to crash into another train but it was entertaining The PS version doesnt have a train but yet it has the tracks for it so go figure that one out

Next lack of vehicles The PC version doesnt have spots where cars just disapeer and it feels like your walking around a ghost town

And something no one can say wouldnt be better you can edit the PC version not only can you put whatever car you want into the game by downloading a simple quick device them importing a car you can download or make yourself but you can also change everything in the game with simmilar tools You can not just add cars you can add missions put more cars into things edit the exsisting map or hell make your own city from scratch

When I play this game i like to ride around in Knight Rider or maybe the General Lee try and eulude cops driving lambourghinis gouranga

Convinced the PC versions better Makes you feel like the PSX you played was lacking huhI cannot get this thing to work with my Wii Rockband 
It might be related to the USB hub that Im using but it simply refuses to be detected by the game

Cosmetically its a microphone Bit on the ugly side
I would be wary of compatibility issues with this oneTo this very day I still cannot understand why everyone loves Tomb Raider so much Aside from the odd improvement here and there the games havent changed vastly I think Doom to Quake is vastly at all I find controlling Lara very clumsey the rd person view not help Plus Lara does all the aiming so the satisfaction of blasting somethings head off from a distance is nonexistent I found myself fart around half the time Wheres the fun in climbing up a rock face Im all for puzzles but I find these games boring and labourious Oh and Lara Croft is not fit because shes not real and if she was shed fall forwards due to her massive mammaries So stop ogling at your screen you sad peopleI was so happy when I got it but it turns out it was BROKEN Do not buy instead of this by star fox  Im dead seriousI was very disappointed in this item  We thought we would get a better picture than the standard WII video cables but definatley took a leap in the wrong direction  I would not recommendEven when it first came out I tried out this game but could not get into it and I hate the n old style d graphics where the camera angle ends up getting you killed every five seconds espessially in pits  Of all the Mario games to date including the amazing Wii titles except for Super Mario Wii this has to be the worst Mario game for me since Mario Nes  The graphics are terrible the music is annoying and its just boaringIll admit right now that I hate all of the Simcities that came out with the exception of the Super Nintendo version of the first Simcity  Im more of an action person not a sitbackandwatchmycitygrow person  Sure  Simcity  is good for a while with its catchy graphics and innovative  approach to buidling a city but a few hours later youll either want to  fall asleep or put your fist through the monitor depending upon whether  the income for your city is positive or negative for each game year  I  turned out to be one of the latter people  No matter how hard I tried I  could never get the income to come out positive  So I did what any  distraught and stuck person would dogo online for cheat codes  An hour  later I was bored  If youre a thinker by all means try Simcity   out  But if youre a person that thinks actions speak louder than words  try Dungeon Keeper  a game like Simcity  but not as complex and  more activeI wanted to get another doom game because I have a friend who wont give it back so I ordered another  and it does not playThe game is okay well it is bad Too arcade for my taste I owned it when I was  years old and it was not even fun for me at that age The wrestlers move to quickly the moves are stupid and the game itself is dull after  matchesWithout a doubt one of the worst games Ive ever played There is no creativity or excitement nothing that makes you want to play more You fight the same boring enemies over and over in large numbers All they do is bum rush you or occasionally throw a snowball The AI in this game is a complete joke Music is horribly forgettable overall sound is okay Graphics are bland and level designs look like they all were developed and programmed in a weekend Each main character has a bit of ingame dialogue and it quickly becomes repetitive and stale AND DO NOT GET ME STARTED ON HOW ANNOYING THE TURKEY SOUNDS ARE

Once you peel away the South Park appeal there is very little left to stand on its own I endured playing this for maybe  minutes before shutting it off out of extreme boredom I can see why nobody ever talks about this game Lets leave it that wayI was interested in this product for the n part  Retrolink makes SNES and NES controllers for PC but no N
Trying to get a PS controller to work on a PC is stupid because every major PC gamepad company has a PS copy of their controller that goes through native USB

I tried all of the following on Windows XP SP  bit and GNULinux Kernel  same results

PS Controller Both official Sony controllers
Dualshock Analog sticks Worked but the back L and R buttons L and R would not trigger  Both analog sticks tracked perfectly
Original No Analog sticks Worked perfect  Back L and R buttons work

PS MadCatz Controller
Didnt work at all  It was however a madcatz and not an official sony controller
Had no authentic ps controllers to test

N
I had two controllers to test with it
Transparent purple  Every button worked but the analog stick would not go   Jamming it to the right shows only a slight movement even though I moved it   Windows configuration was impossible since the C buttons kept firing like someone was pressing them all madly
Gray  All buttons worked but the analog stick and all of the C buttons went haywire and fired constantly

Maybe I got a bad one but I really think this thing sucks

For WCWs first video game made during the Monday Night Wars this was pretty terrible For starters this is more of an arcade type of video game then a game youd expect The game came out in  yet looks and feels like it was made in  transferred to Playstation discs and called a video game

WCW vs The World was developed and published by Japanese companies Asmik Ace Entertainment and The Man Breeze which would probably explain why there are only  WCW wrestlers in the game while the rest of the roster is fictional Japanese wrestlers Thats right folks Only  WCW wrestlers while the rest are madeup Japanese wrestlers that have never even remotely been heard of Its kind of a waste of a game if youre not going to include all of the WCW roster and have a bunch of created wrestlers take up space

The only arenas you can play in are house show like arenas Theres a WCW house show like arena and the rest are Japanese arenas To add on to the Japanese theme in this game theres cheesy music that loops throughout the matches that sounds like it wouldve been acceptable in a s Japanese action movie There are  different modes you can play in this game that are League Challenge Best of Seven Exhibition Match Elimination Match Tournament League Match and Double Title Match

It goes without saying that the movesets in this game are also very limited Each wrestler only has about  to  different moves for you to use until you begin getting bored Ultimately once youve played one match youve played them all Overall this game is just horrible It gets boring within the first  minutes before you want to cut it off A similar WCW game made and published by the same company would come out later that year WCW vs NWO World Tour for the Nintendo  It was slightly better than vs The World but thats not saying much

Basically if you want to play a better WCW game than vs The World for Playstation buy Thunder Nitro Mayhem or Backstage Assault Nitro and Backstage Assault werent all that good but any following WCW game is x more fun to play than this abomination that is WCW vs The WorldI get it it was one of the first games from PS but sincerely this game is horrible Looking back on it the gameplay is stale the graphics look okay the action and moves are lame Miracle is that this game didnt get bashed as it could have beenWhat you see in photo is dust totally disappointed when opened the case and see the disk unclean in that wayCompare this to super mario crash bandicoot and dark souls this game looks too easy and boring
The bosses are a joke A laughing stock next to crash the levels prove to be a bigger challenge with enemies and hidden gems
The graphics and music are terrible too
Id say forget the first three and star with enter the dragonfly and legend seriesIm sure I would love the game if I could play it I have loved all the Hitman games thus far  The one star is due to steam  Steam is absolutely beyond annoying and they do NOT help you if you ask them  I found out after I purchased it that windows xp does not support direct X  I do have a high end video card but it doesnt make a difference  I recommend that no one purchase any games or other items that require steam  Perhaps then they will fix all the problems or go out of business my favorite option  I am very good with computers built mine so that is not the problem  As always its a steam issueIf you like orange bandicoots and video games then get Crash Bandicoot the stuff of dreams and legends I am NGin you FOOL Face my destructive robots That is my fave quote If you hop on the shrooms right before the end o the nd snow bear level and go to the central one you shall find none other but a secret teleport You will go to an unknown warp room that makes no sense CongratsOk here are the reasons this game is BAD
   The graphics arent very good and plus most of the levels look alike
   Its frustrating and there are millions of ways to die in one level
   Youll wish you never had this game
   Most of it doesnt make any sense and its unimaginative
  There  Are those good enough reasons NOT to get this game Dont get itWasnt the very first Crash Bandicoot game supposed to become one of the alltime greatest Playstation games  Thats what Sony thought would happen back in the day  After all they promoted the game to death  Well look at that didnt happen  And with good reason  The game is horrible  I cant believe ANYONE would prefer this junk over Sonic the Hedgehog or especially the Mario Bros series

You have to give Sony a LOT of credit for all the attention they put into Crash Bandicoot in an attempt to put the game on the same extraordinary level as Mario and Sonic but gamers never really caught on to Crash the same way  When you think about it the Playstation already HAD a huge selection of games to choose from around the time Crash was released therefore Sony didnt even NEED a mascot  People were buying Playstation games like crazy anyway  Crash Bandicoot never even had to exist

Youd think for a debut game a BIG debut considering all the advertisements on TV commercials Sony would have made the game a little easier for younger or inexperienced gamers to play  Instead Sony started off the Crash series with impossible bonus levels impossible to complete AND find I didnt even KNOW the game had bonus levels until I looked it up in the instruction booklet

Even if you ignore the bonus levels the challenge overall is pretty high anyway thanks to all the difficult stages such as the one where youre crossing a bridge way up in the sky and continue falling through the wooden cracks a NIGHTMARE of a level  All the lives you earned up to this point in the game will go away  A mascot debut game shouldnt have the difficulty THIS high because the idea is for players of ALL ages to enjoy the game  Children will not like the nonstop frustration

I think the biggest reason Crash Bandicoot isnt remembered today the same way Mario and Sonics debut games are is because Crash is basically just a blend of Mario and Sonic but featured in a D world  Think about it  Crash collects berries throughout the game Mario collects coins Sonic collects rings  Crash has a spin attack Mario and Sonic already had spin attacks YEARS before Crashs existence  Sony just didnt have enough creative ideas to come up with something entirely different and thats why most gamers tend to ignore Crash Bandicoot  When you already have the best Mario and Sonic you dont need imitations

Crash Bandicoot may have improved later on not enough of an improvement to earn its mascot reputation however but the series certainly did NOT start with a bang  I will always remember the very first Crash Bandicoot game as being this uninteresting frustrating experience  Heck just the fact that only  reviewers have submitted reviews for the game right here on amazon goes to show Crash Bandicoots first adventure was meant to be gone and forgotten  Add to the fact that right now in the year  NO ONE is talking about ANY Crash Bandicoot game anymore  This means you can ignore Crash Bandicoot entirely and not really miss out on anythingAugh I found the first few levels of Crash  harder than the rd world levels Crash  and  It also uses a system of having to pass one level to get to the next This becomes frustrating because I found myself having to repeat the same level over and over again because I either died or hell I dont know I just had to repeat the level because it wouldnt let me continue
Also there is no giant screen where you can save You have to find the bonus platform and make it all the way through the bonus part to save Happen to fall through the cracks on the bonus Sorry Youre just going to have to hope you dont die or else youll have to repeat EVERYTHING OVER AGAIN
A little kid is going to get frustrated and give up on this game if you get it for him Be nice to your children Buy them Crash  Or  Or games from the Spyro series that would work too
If you really really want to play all the games in the Crash series just rent it even though its dirt cheap to buy haha Put the money towards something BETTERUpdate June 
Deeply disappointed at the lack of a nonlinear openworld environment But its the restrictive QTE gameplay and finalkill cutscenes that kill the game for me I loath enforced QTE When a mission goes awry and youre trying to escape a hail of bullets if you happen to brush past an assailant you cant escape QTE mode Meanwhile youre being shot at from all sides It just lacks the sense of freedom that Blood Money had and it takes you out of the whole gaming experience placing you instead into a secondrate interactive movie

As a loyal fan of the Hitman franchise I waited years for this I would have loved if they had added driving into the game in order to rival Saints Row or the GTA series etc What they did add took away from the game For instance they should have kept the semiopenworlds of Blood Money and buildon those beautiful sets maps and locations

I would have loved if Hitman had been as open as Skyrim Overall Dishonoreds gameplay is a far superior hitman style gaming experience But I wish they had had Bioshock Infinites breathtaking visuals in that particular game



Wow after all these years waiting this is it

I am still a huge fan of Blood Money The fact that you can now play it again online for free is a huge plus To play all you have to do is watch a second ad on mute and you get sufficient time to play a level Who can complain about that But this what took them so long to produce a bad cousin of Metal Gear Solid

Intuition STOP STOP STOP Please let me use my own intuition And what is it with the game constantly talking to you like youre an idiot All this serves to do is kill any the sense of atmosphere tension and suspense

You want to know how bad this game is They use cut scenes for the final kill thus killing any sense of pay off And you cant even skip through the intro level Hello This was a cult game So lots of people know how to play it and dont need this hand holding to be mandatory

The graphics too are little improvement over Blood Money and are definitely a let down compared to the current generation of games There is less of a nonlinear feel about this version also Now youre not quite tied to a string as you walk through levels but its sub par compared with the freedom of its predecessor IMHO

Such a shame such a shame But good for me as I embark on a career in Video Game Design It gives me confidence that I might have something better to bring to the tabledont really need cards larger than MB and the MB by sony is most compatible with all games but these work tooEverytimes we loaded the game it would play for maybe  mins and then would keep freezing and not play and my gaming system is not messed up I cant return the game I threw away the bag I wish companies would test their damn games before selling them disapointedUnless you still have a PS  and like it the game sucks Bought it for my Son and playing it on a PS
Its very anoying to have only the option to use UDLR to moove in the game No joistickL use at all
It may be a very nice Game but the controller use make it suck Comon we are in  It may be my bad do not know more about PS use still if I had read a review about that I wouldnt had bought the game My Son played TY all the way trought with some help of me We are not big gamers but like jump n run games
So please be aware of the controller use limit The game will en up in the corner Very sad shipping and the item it self where very good Hope the TY is betteris in the Mail LOL yes lots of old games but my son is  so let him scratch or kill the game on accitent same as the PS its not a big Deal But for now it helps him to learn to handle games and take care of stuff And the games are cheap since some PPL always think they have to have the Newest Thanks to those like this we have fun for less
Sincerely
MSaved one game and now it will no longer work stick to brand name memory cardsThis game is horrible First I bought this video game because I thought it was fun Well in wasnt st the graphics are poor nd the computers difficulty level is so hard If you play with one two or three people you always lose The computer is WAY more expirenced than a human will ever be and it just degrades from the fun factor So ignore the reviews that say it is so great They are overexxagerating My yearold brother got bored with it in  hoursWho created this game and why I get the concept and its a really good one Then why did I give it one star This game is created for people who find Call of Duty and Halo so easy they get bored and refuse to play them The minigames must be beaten absolutely flawlessly or you dont get any points whatsoever Sometimes you even lose points for not absolutely mastering the minigame If youre  perfect sorry no points The biggest flaw in this game is that it has to be four players If you dont have four players then the computer will take over the rest Be warned the computer always wins every single mini game Theres a choice for computer skilleasy normal or hardhuh What is hard skill Does that mean the game is hard for the computer player or the computer player is hard for you to beat No explanation whatsoever But it does not matter Ive tried all three settings multiple times and it makes no difference in the computers amazing flawless skill at mastering the game The point of the game is to get  coins by absolutely mastering the minigames as flawlessly as inhumanly possible then randomly landing on the space where Toad is selling stars for  coins Watch out theres also a space where if they have  coins other players can steal your star They should call this game Star Stealers The only real trick to the game is to be the one who lands on the star stealing spot the most timesand thus steal everyone elses stars Theres no friendly competition hereits all about bing underhanded If you dont have  coins to steal a star you can for zero coins steal coins from other players this game always leads to everyone ganging up on the player who is doing the best Theres no skill involved to winning the game over all because its all about whos lucky enough to land on the star stealing spot the most times One turn your in first place and the next your in fourth but when youre in fourth youre stuck Whoever happens to have the most stars when the game ends wins the game no matter how poorly you played the game Oh and dont forget they the shortest version of the game takes  minutes minimum The longest version takes  hours Ridiculous and frustrating to no end Its a game that takes a minimal of an hour to lose No thank you You should try Chefs Luv Shack its based on the same concept but you can actually win the minigames once in a whileThis game doesnt workI bought it usedit was packaged very well thoughWe have a very upset son hereI am letting you know so that you can test the games before you send them to other peoplein more ways than one  Besides the overall poor quality of the game there was that camera  Honestly whoever designed that thing needs to be smacked with a wet fish
I played levels  through  and then had to stop just before the end of the game because I was nauseated and had an eyestrain headache  I am not exaggerating
The camera has a tendency to swirl around when you need it to stay still and to sit still when you need it to move  The grainy pixelated graphics and complete lack of distinguishing features in the levels make it not only very easy to get lost but also very hard on the eyes  When you need to jump across platforms or walk AROUND something thats when things really get bad  Flik leaves almost no shadow on the ground when he jumps so your jumps will usually be blind leaps of faith  The other problem is his feet  He dangles his feet so low when he jumps that  times out of  you will miss a platform because his feet wont plant on it  And when he does land he wont stop running which will send him promptly stepping right off the other end of the thing and forcing you to do the jump all over again
The other problem is the camera angles when walking around something  When you walk around to the other side of a large object for some idiotic reason the camera does not follow you  As a result you are sitting there with your entire screen filled in by this object while you cant see Flik on the other side  Now as if that situation is not bad enough picture yourself having to do a platform jump while your view of Flik is completely blocked by a large rock on the screen or being hit by an enemy that you cant see because the camera wont move  Instead of turning with you you must stop for about  seconds after turning to allow the camera to catch up  At the same time the camera has a tendency to turn even while youre just running straight ahead in a single direction which results in you being completely reversed  Its completely disorienting and with the bland nearly identical levels you can find yourself lost and irritated very frequently
Its all fun and games until youve developed a tension headache trying to look at the bad graphics and camera angles and flung your controller across the room because you just dont feel like attempting that same jump for the th time  Please stay away from this one  Dont become an accomplice to anymore game companies trying to cash in on a movie franchiseThe product arrived in its original case with game booklet The case was cracked and the CD had minor scratches on it The gameplay controls are very confusing and difficult It takes some getting used to The image was very dark not sure if it was my TV but no other games have ever had this problem The ingame options did not have and actual brightness setting to help me with this The sound during gameplay will randomly crackle and or stop all together Overall i was not happy with the game itself I had no problems with the provider or the arrival of the productThis game is so stupid like one of the reviers said all you do is find stuff and haveto find the exit door And the last three levels are impossible to beat because they all look the same and you keep finding the same door you went through before This game is like doom you know the one where you just see the weapon Dont get me wrong the graphics were cool but it just sucked and the only way to beat it is if you cheatI love puzzles I mean I LOVE PUZZLES

But I dont love this

Not only is this game boring the graphics arent too great either even for PS one my other games look better than this

I think Im better off playing puzzle games online for freeOkay Im not totally lowbrow I can get puzzles I got near the end of this game called Lighthouse I couldnt get this at all when I played it not even a bit You roam around this island getting fragmented information and at least on the computer the puzzle hitdetection seemed weak so trying to access the puzzles themselves even with a guide was a frustrating endeavor The puzzles themselves were bad enough but the fact that solving some of them didnt seem to change anything discernible at least in the early stages of the game meant I ultimately gave up in frustration  Not to mention it wasnt even fun

Instead of this Id recommend Okami or any other hybrid puzzlerpg  If you cant figure out the puzzle with the tools possessed you can at least take out your frustrations on a hapless creature in battleI have used many third party expansion packs and they all have failed They have caused my console to crash and have experienced other issues I now am using the Nintendo brand expansion pack and have never had problems sinceI have used a lot of third party expansion packs for the Nintendo  and they all have been problematic causing crashes and other issues The only one that works without a problem is the Nintendo brand Expansion PakI was really mad that on the buying site it said it was made buy Sony and found out later it was made in China Sony makes their own stuff in Japan This is false advertizingProducts offered by many marketplace sellers are not original Nintendo Brand Often they are unlicensed third party knockoff expansion packs Ive personally had these damage a system and ruin games Look for sellers offering the real thing by Nintendo Ive warned you You can save a few bucks and take your chances Deviation from the actual product isnt even allowed on Amazon Their very listings are a violation to begin with Their feedback speaks for itselfI HATE THIS GAME IT SUCKED HARD TO CONTROL THE THIRD GAME IS IMPOSSIBLE AND STUPID THE SECCOND GAME IS HARD TO CONTROL AND OVERALL ITS JUST AWFULLA FPS original Xbox game locked to FPS with missing P support As opposed to every other version the US and JP PS port has support for switching the voice track between ENG or JPN Choosing JPN helps massively with the cringeworthy ENG voices but this hardly makes it a better game It begins easy then ends up slippery and borderline unfair in no time Youre essentially playing the same line of stages in the same order with different missions per character Also the camera system has been completely screwed over by the porters Honestly this and Unleashed are great examples of D games in the series that are worse than  At least the framerate is stableThis game is horrible first of all the play is slow This game gets confusing after a while the levals are just too chanelging The graphics are weak and a poor excuse for a star wars game The voice overs are soo weak It takes way too long to load and get thourgh a leval This doenst even follow the movie real well it goes out of the way and follows the smallest details This is a must not buy and a huge letdown Star Wars derserves a better game for thier first movie a almost  years and especially with all the new technology around Dont buy this gameIt turned out to be a MB card While I would usually return it I dont have another card to transfer all of my files to MB is still a ton of space though for PS savesIve been a Duke Nukem fan for a long time I loved Time to Kill and enjoyed Land of the Babes Total Meltdown is the most frustrating  FPS I have ever played The speed is so fast it is hard to move Looking up and down is a chore You use L and L to look up and down Jumping puzzles are annoying and swimming is almost impossible Crouching is hard and the graphics are terrible Sound is bad as well The only funny part about this Duke Nukem game is the rulebookit is funny The only semidetailed part of this game is Dukes weapons and hand animations Even the cutscenes are bad Please try to avoid this game and save some cashI bought this and the key didnt work  It was a gift and the recipient wasnt able to solve the problem  It might have been a good game but I never found out because the key failedHonestly theres nothing good about this game  The graphics are NOT at all what the playstation console has the ability for  The graphics are more like Sega Genesis or Super Nintendo or even the atari rather than the Playstation  If you like games with good graphics do not get this game
  The gameplay isnt that great also  The N version is much better because the gameplay is more up to date and realistic and plus the graphics are what the graphics SHOULD be like on the new and modern consoles
  I swear play a demo or atleast rent the game I rented it and it was the worst money I ever spent and check out the graphics  Plus in order to know the story of this game you have to read the direction book  I cant remember it word by word but it went something like this Duke was blasted out his ship and was about to be greeted by earth when he realizes that a swarm of aliens has crowded the city of LA Okay so the story sounds goodbut why wasnt there a sequence within the game SHOWING us the story  And plus all the bad guys that you shoot look like cardboard
  I think that whatever company or designers created this game obviously didnt have much money at the time so they decided to make a mediocre game  This was bad  Believe me
  If you want a game with good gameplay excellent graphics wonderful and atmospheric feelings to it get some game on the playstation like a final fantasy
  If you want a game with awful graphics bad gameplay no storyline sequences and a Sega Genesis feel then get this game
  This game is not worth any money at allYes people this game sucks big time This game came with the original Nintendo system back in late s I had a hard time trying to beat this game because the control was down right horrible Most of the time youll jump off edges by accident And who  would pay  to relive the nightmare of this game Apparent  people who reviewed this game and my friend didThis product is not actually distributed by Sony As well Playstation  consoles to my knowledge do not have any existing memory cards above the MB in size Theres some nasty hack for it that simply doesnt work and this card will never work like they say it does Its essentially a regular memory card without the MB memory limitation therefore making the PS overwrite previous data because the memory card is full but the PS doesnt understand that its full thus causing corruptions

My source of this information The Internet and the two MB memory cards I bought years ago not off Amazon though

Seriously dont be fooled by thisst shipment received a book instead of the game
nd shipment got a FAKE one Game arrived with a wrong key inside on sealed box I got in contact with codemasters and send them pictures of the DVD and the content They said nothing they can do its a fake DVD

Returned it good byeI bought this I think there is something going on with it I am giving it  star not very good when I play the pikachu yellow version game I keep on hearing static and fuzzy noises not a very good hand held device this is not a very good hand held device dont waste your money if I were you I would keep my money I made a mistake of buying this I would not recommened this system to anyoneThe gameboy color was good but i really like the  gameboy the grey one that takes  batteriesDefective product Microsoft made these sticks back in the olden days when computers had game ports They stopped making these and then brought them back into production But by that time the computers no longer came with game ports so they supplied this stick with a UBS adapter that is unique to this product no standard UBS adapter will work The seller did not include this adapter in the box and claimed that I was lying when I flied a complaint with Amazon In the end he sent me a UBS adapter that was made to fix some of these problems with these older devices but that did not work So I returned the product He  told me to send it back to him  when a product Is defective the merchant is required to pay return shipping but he did not want to do that and he would pay for the shipping when he got it back He did not do that and then told Amazon that the adaptor was in the box well yes the third party adapter was in the box the one that he sent me in an attempt to solve the problemI paid extra because i thought it was by Nintendo as advertised Its generic What a bunch of bullTHIS IS A SCAM DO NOT BUY they take a the case as seen in picture and put a  mb save card in it expecting you not to find out these are NOT  mb card they are mb cards with a case that tells you its  DO NOT BUY THIS YOU WILL END UP WITH A TERRIBLY MADE  mb CARD THIS PRODUCT IS AS MUCH OF A SCAM AS CAN BEThe worst game EVER created I wouldnt take this game even if someone offered ME money to take itWhat a POS this game was and still is today All you do is just fly through rings over and over and over and over and over againuntil you wanna pull your fing hair out The controls are hard and complicatedthere is no storyand the graphics look like sh I hate this game with a burning passion and every single Ringman  cartridge that exists in the worldneeds to be destroyedso future generations of gamers are spared the agony of this giant lump of buttwasteThis is one of the worst games of all time  I remember playing this as a kid and just kept sucking at it  When I was a kid I didnt understand a game could be bad and simply thought I was doing something wrong and kept playing until I finally accepted this game is awful  The control in this game is really bad especially during the ring stages  Youll just fly all over the place  The first instinct for such terrible control is to move slowly but you have a time limit so you dont have time to move slowly  When I got to a point where I could fight it was like a maze and had no idea where to go  The ONLY reason anyone should buy this game is for game collecting only and even then they should save this when they are scraping the bottom of the barrelThis game does not in fact star Superman It stars his genetically engineered clone created by Lexcorp known as Stuporman Stuporman staggers like a drunken person relies on powerups for super powers pulls punches so enemies beat him likes random time limits including ones that lead to an instant game over can pass through solid objects like they arent even there and can die from things that cannot hurt the real man of steel in a million years like ordinary bullets and explosions He was created for the sole purpose of ruining Supermans reputation by making him look pathetic and weak All part of Lex Luthors evil plan If you love Superman dont buy this game or youll be buying into a lieFly threw rings and pick up carsthis game is an insult and should be shoved up the developers anusSuperman  after playing the game and reading the remarks made about this game  I question the existence of Titus why it was made
Alright on with the Review
Graphics Eyebleeding Dont look at them
Controls Dont start with me  they are slower than Molasses to make Supe perform his punches Even the Multiplayer controls are nearunfinished
Sound and Music Ugh dont question me uninspiring The Superman theme is nonexistent Sound is lowbudget voiceacting is from the series but Im definitely not in love with either them or this game
Plot Lex Luthor has trapped Lois Lane Jimmy Olsen and Prof Hamilton in a virtual world with Kryptonite fog in it and Supe has to go in and rescue them while putting down the SuperVillains Luthor purposely put there
Fun Factor This is not fun For one neither I nor my brother can beat the first level  Supe both flying and running moves slow  if you try to fly Youll have only tenpercent control over it Not to mention the objectives you do are only for monkeys youve got a timer for most of your objectives this game is repetitive above all else you have a health meter a meter for all of your special abilities minus flying and youre gonna have to really try to get over your anger and impatience to beat this game
And so This is one of the worst games Ive played it literally ruined the Superman experience pick up SpiderMan for the PSX N or Dreamcast and enjoy the greatness it has to offer
J GartenThis game was soooo bad I took it immediately back to the game store where I got it from I got it since I am a Superhero fan but trust me even if you are a diehard fan of Superman resist the urge to purchase this game or trade for it or even accept it for free This is one of those noway games that should be thrown in the microwave and have the molecules in it to be melted for good
 When i first turned the game on the people in the first level looked like an oil painting And it is nearly impossible to fly through those rings Miss one ring and words show up that sayLex wins and you hear a really bad reproduction of baldys laugh
I put two stars for this being a fun game because it is so much fun to laugh at I wonder why DC let Titus make this horrific game sobNintendo power voted it the worst game ever

Gamestop and spot hate it

I was unfortunate enough to stumble upon this game at my local video store I thought superman Ill have to try that I have never seen a game more deserving of the following THIS IS THE WORST GAME EVER IT DESERVES TO BE BURNED IT IS A DISGRACE TO INTELLIGENT BEINGS EVERYWHERE MAKIND SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF ITS POOR ABILITY TO CREATE GAMES IT IS UTTERLY POINTLESS IT MAKES SOUTH PARK LOOK LIKE SHAKESPEARE IT MAKES ALIEN HOMINID SEEM EASY AND SOPHISTICATED

Somewhere far far away Superman weepsIn Kill Bill Vol  David Carradine described Superman as follows Not a very good comic not particularly welldrawn  Well I suppose if Caine from Kung Fu is talking about this character then the game must be cool too right  Its been almost  years since Titus released the most unorthodox game to ever grace our solar system  It must be good since were still talking about all these years later

Seriously theres a lot to like about SUPERMAN   You wont need any sort of defect warranty because the second you flip the POWER switch it works every time  Its refreshing to buy an electronic device knowing that its electrical circuits will never fail you

Equally cool is that Superman flies in this gameI like it when he flies  Every time I pop in this cartridge Im even more eager to watch  the Christopher Reeve moviesall  of them

The plot is revealed to the gamer with great restraint  You see there are bizarre murky images that even David Lynch or Stanley Kubrick wouldnt be able to visualize  For example Lois Lane and Jimmy Olsen are confined to uma blurry contraption that kidnaps them or does it imprison them  I personally couldnt tell if it was really Jimmy and Lois because its very hard for the gamer to completely understand the cutscenes  But isnt it neat to figure it out for yourself  You see because the graphics are so confusing and blurry you get to keep playing again to unearth the games secrets  And dont worry about completing SUPERMAN  in a short period of time either  Its a tough game and there are few games that equal its challenge

Whats most remarkable is how the game also addresses Supermans emotional state  Im sure KalEl struggles to use his powers properly its not easy for a nearinvincible alien to do the right thing   Titus has tackled this concept very faithfully  You see when Superman flies he wont always do what the N Controller tells him to do  A freespirited main characterbrilliant

Lastly Supermans powers are present here  He has his eyelasers and windfreeze breath  Thats always neat huh  But whats even more most fascinating is that The Man of Steel  according to this game  has the ability to manipulate the physical dimensions in which he exists  He sometimes will be flying casually through the sky and then have a sudden urge to fly through the buildings of Metropolis  How cool is that  On the other side of this spectrum there are moments where Superman will get stuck in a wall or a drainage ditchyou know I still havent figured out how to beat those sections of the game  I wonder is there a higher power known only to Superman  I ask because Titus refuses to give us easy answers to this puzzling N entry  The most gifted scientists researchers cryptologists artists and gamers will not be able to solve this enigma

SUPERMAN  is one of the most unforgettable and original experiences in all of gaming

THIS REVIEW WAS MEANT TO BE SARCASTIC AND SATIRICAL  I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE IF YOU BUY THIS GAMEI could go on and on but look it is really very simple Its hard to believe Titus could have screwed up this game so badly They should be ashamed of themselves for releasing it
So to all always PRONTO pay attention to mister number one best sheriff students idiotic post i love you sophisticated people who drop the f bomb and think you are coolWhite Trash that sums you up  have a nice day
And dont forget you hafta agree with me at all times click on the YES button under my review obey me everything that has to do with good things of meI didnt even play this game and I dont own an N but because there are so many bad reviews I will just give this game another bad review so people wont buy it since its supposed to be the WORST GAME EVERWhat you thought they were for the game Get real The arcade game was more fun and all you did was walkfly right and punch I cant go lower than one with the ratings so I decided to use it for something worth while The actual score I give Superman  on a scale of  to  is  See if you can find anyone who disagrees

Ehh changed my mind Ill show the games score wouldnt want anyone to think I actually liked this thing

You know what I get tired of people thinking I actually LIKE this thing so I change the star rating to give it the score it deservesWhen I heard Nintendo was coming out with superman I got all excited then they delayed the release date which usually means the game is going under even more improvements  When I bought Superman I sped all the way home turned off my phone and sat in my chair  To my suprise this game is not worth the plastic its made of  I dont even have one good thing to say about it  I was extremely disappointed  Superman used to be coolOnce again we have an example of an Amazon vendor claiming one thing and delivering something else
This CDROM did not even come in a protective plastic jacket I suppose little Tommys parents wouldnt give him the money to purchase one so he could completely fool the Amazon Dupe customer that he paid good money for a legal copyIt works only when wanting to I thought it was initially cause the console was old so i purchased a new one last week and it acts the exact same way sometimes it loads up sometimes it dont sometimes it loads up but says its unformated others it says it doesnt have enough space for a save when it has more than  of the mb still available and also sometimes it will say no memory card in slot available  This is so worthless I think Ill rather use this for a databank sort of holder and just play off of a normal mb one copy and pasting within the ps browser option cause this is to frustrating to deal with on a regular playing basisnot worth  cents graphics are very poor for nintendo  The game is very tedious finding pass cards in every level to open doors gets old very quick The aliens also dont put up a fight just there to die Co op would be a nice feature but it is the same maps and bots running in circles is boring After level  there seams to be missing the yellow card looked every where and my friend and i could not find it A much better version of this is availible on the ps  definately dont waste any money on this game it down right sucksDiRT  was like this  Im becoming more  more suspicious of games like this that require a continuous open Internet to play  It just seems like bait set out for some young naive prey to fall for  Does anyone honestly believe that personal information is collected for no particular reason  I dont care what they say publicly  Any assurances of privacy protection are quite hollow without close oversight and nobodys looking  Its quite a different thing to knowingly step out into a multiplayer server where you know youre being tracked but this type of continuous spying is something more  That aside this carrot on a stick has more problems than just security

CONS  Requires open Internet Windows Live to play  Annoying interface  Continuous reminders to upload and download things you already selected not to do  Most settings dont keep between sessions  Setting up a race takes way too long  Irritating music you cant turn off it keeps coming back  Takes too long to unlock things  Entire career mode is pointless when the game setup is so irritating I just wanted out  Video stuttering possibly my equipment

PROS  Eye candy  Plenty of game modes  Enough tracks to get going  Fairly good variety of cars  Scaled difficulty levels from casual to advanced

I think this franchise like many others continues soley for the purpose of farming user information where it seems the real money is  If I cant turn it off and some else controls the onoff switch thats a problem  Sometimes it might be worth it but not here  I found some entertainment value but very briefly  Anyway  just my opinionI bought this thinking that an MB card would be to small So I figured getting a larger one would be alright I was wrong One of the problems is that it hardly works There is one main causes to this
 The casing in incorrect Its too loose to fit properly and make a clean connection to the contacts This results in the PS recognizing the card about  of the time

So dont buy this Just go get an official MB Besides MB will go a long wayAs I expected this game has good reviews but does FF deserve that praise No

It was my birthday and I wanted a new console and a cool game to go with it I remembered getting a Genesis with Sonic  and having a SNES felt wrong until I got Super Mario World

I got my mom to get me a PS and FF All the kids were raging about it And it was in D Wow just imagine FF but in D Oh man

Thus began my unfortunate exploration of the JRPG I hadnt played FF at this point but I played Chrono Trigger The backgrounds looked nice The music was epic and the sound was trash A lot of the sound was trash It sounds worse than a SNES game And whats the deal with the Popeyelooking characters But something was compelling about the game I wanted to know what happened next

The only reason I played games as a kid was to see what happened next I only wanted a new weapon in Mega Man because it was cooler than the MBuster It was a fetish Mastering a challenge to achieve fun was foreign to me

The video game industry is an industryit exists to make money If a publisher puts out a game that makes money but isnt strictly a videogame they WILL do it What was Squares motivation when they developed this game Tell a story Let players express themselves through cunning materia strategies and complex boss fights and complex dungeons Something else I dont know

Lets look at what weve got The game lets you start easy by pitting you against  weak enemies One sword strike will kill them or you can throw lightning I think they even give you some inventory items You can safely see how the combat works You get to name Cloud and Barrett anything you want This makes the game personal but I dont know anyone who did that Its irrelevant because the bastard is still going to have his existential crisis and behave in ways that you might not choose

Eventually you have a boss fight that thanks to mistranslation tells you to ATTACK WHILE its tail is UP If you do this the boss will hit a party member causing you to do the battle the opposite of how they intended You might even game over After that more dialog and you get to make a choice with Aeris Youd better get out of here or Nothinghey listen This affects a cutscene WAY WAY down the line from here I never made the connection until recently

The materia system lets you customize your spells If you want a mage you load him with spells his HP decreases and his MP increases Its a good idea to change his row making him stand further away from the enemy thus killing your melee damage but protecting you from melee damage The game doesnt handhold it lets you figure out the finer points of the materia system I liked how FF let your characters permanently learn spells but FF are tied to materia Its not a bad system but considering the game is  hours long you might master it before then and get bored

For years Ive gone back and forth with myself about whether FF is good Ive concluded its partly responsible for making games too casual Despite that its an RPG you dont get to make meaningful choices You get to make very few choices about what Cloud does outside combat and most of them dont really matter If were going to try elevating videogames it would behoove JRPG fans to demand more choices so they can truly roleplay their own anime hero Id recommend giving players choices in story that let them end up a pathetic failure or butt of the joke in their own story Fail states are important

Of course that would take a master stroke in storytelling something videogames arent known for Videogames are not literature For every decent videogame story there are  books as satisfying as eating a meal Game stories are intentional experiences that happen a specific way If they dont happen that way then the designer has to account for that or face an endless web of possibilities Games are dumb at telling stories Even games that give you plenty of dialog options are bogus because the end result is the same At the end of FF there is only one outcome This is a roleFORCING game

Im fine with games having cutscenes per se If this game was combat anime combat anime combat anime without any illusions of choice Id be perfectly happy with that

I shouldve got an NOh here they come Can you hear it The wimpy cries of the thousands and thousands of fanboys and fangirls of this failure of an RPG I can certainly hear them because Ive been listening to them for the past few years I will admit I was excited to play this game at first seeing as I never played it before Christmas of but honestly I wish I had never played it at all Why Well stick around sit back shut up and read

STORY 
Atrocious Simply atrocious You start the game as an exSOLDIER named Cloud default name seeing as you have the option to name your main character who is currently an employed gun for a resistance group called AVALANCHE Why these groups and names have big capital letters for seemingly no reason is beyond me seeing as they dont stand for anything Along the way youll meet and greet a number of people who have nothing to do with what youll be doing in the current area youre in get pissed off with the inability to comprehend even the slightest bit of dialogue spitting from the mouths of these characters and finally come to the climax of the game facing yet ANOTHER completely overrated villain in a battle that will last about thirty minutesbut not because its hard Its not I have so many problems with this games storyokay I have a lot of problems with this game PERIOD You get a total of  characters in your party and guess what Seven of them have absolutely NOTHING to do with the main storyline whatsoever The only reason they exist is for partyfilling seeing as they completely blew away any resemblance of a cast and crew of characters that actually mean something towell ANYTHING Two of them you dont even technically have to get in your party to begin with You can literally beat the entire gameall  hours of itwith the drooling retards you pick up along the way The game is so stale and boring in terms of taking your hand and walking you through the story and everywhere you turn you can see something you can bitch about for hours Party members included

GAMEPLAY 
Same thing as every other Final Fantasy game released before its time Theres seriously nothing revolutionary about this game Its the same boring lazy turnbased system youre used to except they actually find ways to make it even less enjoyable The movement of the battles themselves feels and looks glitched and every time you use an attack skill or spell youll be sitting there waiting for them to finish with your thumb up your ass Oh and if you plan on summoning a powerful magic creature from the Summon materiawell I certainly hope you stocked up on food drinks and toilet paper youll be sitting there staring at the atrociouslylong summon animations for the next hour and a half before you can even make your next move

PRESENTATION 
What are you talking about This game is CLEARLY not even finished Do you know how many glitches bugs and excruciating errors I found while playing this game Hundreds The sickest part I didnt go out of my way to find them They came to me The character models look ridiculous nobody has anything interesting to say no matter where you are in the game the battles are boring and unworthy to the franchises name and youll be lucky if you can even make it to the end without exploiting a glitch or two Or ten Not only that but the game is WAY too easy I literally played through the entire gamestory and allin less than  hours In that time I never once died or even lost a member of my party if youre not counting Aeris seeing as she dies in a cutscene And hey if youre having trouble with something just exploit one of the hundreds of glitches in this game to allow yourself the ability to walk through walls gain infinite money and items level your entire party up to  in a single fight deal millions of damage to an enemy with a single hit or even reset every single ingame switch so you can replay absolutely everything in the game over again with all the stats items and equipment you already have But seriously who the hell would play through THIS monstrosity anything more than once This unfinished broken piece of cow dung is not worth the time

SOUNDTRACK 
What soundtrack Its just a bunch of clicks screeches and otherwise infuriating sounds Its not music Its a collaboration of angerinducing noises that will have your TV muted in less than thirty seconds or your money back GUARANTEED

OVERALL RATING 
This game is even lucky I can give it the rating I did Its especially lucky that Amazoncoms ability to rate its products only comes in five stars If it was a standard  rating Id hack my computer to give it less than  seeing as I cant stand this absolute travesty of a video game Its a downright abomination to the world and a big slap to the face of anybody who was seriously into Final Fantasy like myself Im glad I didnt play this game until years after it came out If I had played it back then I probably would have been just like all of the other sniveling fanboys and girls and considered it the greatest game of all time You cant rate a game based on how well it sold and you cant rate a game depending on the graphics Why Because both of those factors are meaningless when it comes to a true review I strongly recommend that anybody who is interested in buying this game should steer WAY clear of it it is not worth even the effort to post a picture of it here on Amazon Its not worth a penny out of your pocketThis game was a ripoff  It has less terrain less tracks and less features than DiRT   The graphics are about the same  Not worth the money at allId like to preface my review by saying I had heard A LOT about this game The main character Cloud is pretty famous and pops up in a variety of games like Kingdom Hearts so I was really interested in trying it out That coupled with the high reviews on gaming sites like IGN which quotes that FFVII is The RPG by which all others are to be measured FFVII is a cinematic wonder had me thrilled to try this out For some perspective IGN quotes my favorite game of all time Zelda Ocarina of Time as IGN reviews the biggest game of the decade Does Zelda  live up to the hype I never owned a PS until the PS  PS so I was stoked to see this title come out on the PS network for 

Now that you know a little bit about what I was expecting from this game Ill provide a little bit about my gaming stylehistory before I go into the game review Im a huge RPG fan and I like a variety of games in that style turnbased timer real time strategy action Ive played a few FF games III X Tactics Tactics II and I liked them all except for X which I found to be a little too easy albeit very pretty I also really enjoy the Dragon Quest games Ive been into video games since I was  and apart for a workinduced stint of abstinence in college I still enjoy video games when time permits

As soon as I started playing this game I kept telling myself it must get better Its just a slow start surely the story picks up I pushed on for a few hours going through Clouds background story and getting an idea of the main story arch before I finally gave it up as a bad job Im glad I only spent  to try this game out and not 

Graphics
Im not sure what IGN is talking about but these graphic are terrible Yes I know the game is from  but Zelda OCT came out in  and its graphics have held up to the test of time much better Although the PS and N pregraphics expansion are supposed to be comparable a PS example of an older game with much better graphics is Chrono Cross  PS The majority of the background for FFVII is a muddy brown that looks sort of like mulch Also since it was being released on the PS network Sony and Square Enix could have taken the time to revamp the graphics like Nintendo did for OCT on the Game Cube instead of releasing a game whose graphics are so bad I get a bit of a headache on the newer TVs Maybe it would look better on an old TV Who knows The cut scenes have slightly better graphics which are almost comparable to Zelda OCTs in game graphics

Story
I wasnt really impressed by it although it its an interesting concept Ive done my best to be vague in this section so that potential buyers wont have the story spoiled for them

GOODUnique
When you boil it down you are basically fighting as an ecoterrorist and thats an interesting concept

BAD
The character integration into the story is very poor When you look at all the characters background stories it doesnt make sense that they are all working together If the game spent more time with them discussing WHY they have their common goal of being ECOterrorists it would fit better Aside from the fact that they are all ecoterrorists who live in the same beat down community they really have nothing in common

I did not like the characters I had been introduced to before I quite playing Cloud is incredibly angsty and selfcentered in the beginning and I found all the social scenes centered on him to be unpleasant His friendship with Tifa doesnt make much sense to me either Tifa is a sweet person and portrayed as kindhearted yet she seems to be obsessed with Cloud who is nothing like her emotionally Barret um can we say racist Barret the only black person in the game consistently beats his chest like a gorilla Yes lets make the black person look and act like a gorilla

Gameplay

Mediocre

This is the most important part for some people although I tend to find the story to be nearly as important For me if the story is bad it would take phenomenal game play to keep me engaged in the game The game play here was average it has a pretty typical timer setup nothing to write home about Im not sure if this game invented timer play if so Kudos to Square Enix The timer play did make the beginning more interesting in that you were literally thrown into the game with no instructions so it took a little while to get a hang of the game play Once I figured out the game play though hr of game time most of which is scenes I quickly grew tired of this game

Summary
This game has average game play terrible story horrific graphics even for a late s game and pretty pathetic characters I played for  hours and then gave up on it My free time is limited and I dont waste time on games that arent fun because they might get better Maybe FFVII really picks up in hour  All I know is that I was very disappointed in the game and Im quite incredulous about the higher reviews here on Amazon and on other gaming sites

UPDATE
Barrett  when Cloud is introduced to headquarters Barrett beats on his chest like a gorilla which I found to be a poor choice for the only black character in the game to be doing However his overall portrayal may not be that racist as I only played for  hours and many claim he is treated better in the later game

Despite the comments and emails Ive gotten about this review I still leave it as star Without the nostalgia goggles I didnt enjoy the story the graphics the gameplay or the charactersWhen I first bought my PS I got FF FF and FF  That was back in   FF  FF I liked Good stories  loveable characters  But FF was a drag

Then I saw all the positive reviews best game ever so I decided to give FF a second playing in  to impress me  But I still did not like it  IMHO the major flaw is that FF has too many dry sections where you fightfightfight and almost nothing happens storywise example  climbing the floor building of your enemy or the dumb section where you waste an hour finding a dress  In some sections literally hours pass by with no story it feels like a step backwards to the nearnonexistent stories of the original nintendo



Also the Battle Engine  totally unbalanced  A good RPG will provide balance between physical  magical attacks so they are nearequal  A good RPG will make each character unique with specific skills  weaknesses like real peoplesome are fighters others are healers Not so FF

 its all magic physical attacks are worthless about  the damage

 and the characters are completely interchangeable You can equip Fire to your man  Heal to your girl  And then the next battle completely flip it around so the man is the healer  the girl is the killer  And then flip it again  No individuality Each character is identical  Plus instant learning and instant forgetting not realistic at all



Also the story while good is poorly executed  It basically boils down to a meteor poisoning the planets health  very simple concept  but the writer dances around  adds unnecessary complication  He takes    and turns it into     Thats why so many gamers go Huh What just happened  It was a good story but a lousy script

Overall FF is one of the weakest games in the FF series inferior to the other PS gameFF super nintendo games FF FF FF even inferior to FFAll right listen up all you socalled video game experts and critics Let me give you the lowdown on Final Fantasy VII
For the past year I have stood by Final Fantasy VII saying that it is the best RPG ever created I was wrong It WAS the best RPG ever created in  When FF VII first came out on the PSX it was said to be the best game ever put on the PSX They were right When it was released in  the graphics in the game blew away the graphics of previous games and later games The storyline itself was gripping and although it had its dull moments it culminated in a spectacular finish
Now I think the reason that most of you think this game sucks is because it has been  years  YEARS since this game hit the shelves and every year we see new games and flashier graphics And you DARE compare this game to a PS GAME Its just not fair The capabilities of the PSX could never in a million years rival that of the PSs capabilities Its just not gonna happen
Other than that this game is tolerable considering todays standards But they will never be able to compete with FF VIIs soundtrack it is beyond competition
OUTAre you joking This is by far the WORST final fantasy in my opinion Man are you guys even trying anymore  I looked at final fantasy x and rented it and gosh you cant even make a good game out of that
Manbad graphics horrible gameplay sucky battle system hard to understand VERY difficult to get into it too confusing dumbxxx characters like cloud hes the worstexcept sephiroth sometimes too long of cutscenes boring cutscenes you can barely see their eyes  mouth etc etc etc etc times a million
I hate this gameThe item did not work at all  After plugging in all of the cords nothing happened  The idea is good but the product is junkI bought NBA Showtime with the purchase of my Dreamcast hoping for some real basketball I was sure disappointed After playing it twice I put it away for good The game is stupid NBA Showtime has the worst gameplay ever The computer can jump  feet in the air to make a block then swish a fullcourt shot The graphics are terrible The players muscles are bigger than their heads and they look very unrealistic
This game blows Its just like NFL QB Club except for basketball an NBA KX wannabe
Do not buy this game  Midway sure knows how to mess games upAfter buying my Dreamcast used with alot of games I just noticed that this is the last game I tried out and the first game that I put away The gameplay is the shallowest ever I didnt play or look at this  game since I tried it for the first time The graphics are extremely bad The players look very unrealistic The colors in this game are very bad and dark the entire game looks like an N game
Thats about all I have to say about this NBA K WANNABE GAME
I hope that this review was helpful to youi wish i did not buy this thing  it gets in the way all the time the cables are everywhere and when i dropped it the thing cracked down the middle  i recommend radioshack itemsSoul Calibur is a classic example of all icing and no cake The game looks great and sounds great but its too easy The game that is supposed to be the game for die hard fighting fans is basically a walk in the park The game is a button masher I played the game and found that turtling up and waiting for the right time to attack or throw is all that it takes to succeed and it even works on the higher dificulty settings
My major gripe about the game is the dark and demonic story lines No God fearing person should touch this demon sword wielding game I began to discover the different plots after I played it Im not trying to sound like a fanatic but come on why all the demon intense plots in a generally evil game What sick minds came up with this anyway
If the game had a better plot one that involved some thought then it would be a classic but as it standsnoIf you want a game that you can master in  mins with any character then POWER STONE IS IT I beat the game as I got it once I discovered the formula
Ill list the pros and cons to give you a fair rundown
Pros
 Characters are unique and fun with personality ie personal story ending etc missing from PS
 Backrounds are the BOSS and fully interactive
 The moves and effects are radical King Capcom shines here
 Fast action
 Cool Japanese voices
Cons
 One dimensional fighting sucks as a D fighting game
 Weapons make no sense once you know the formula They just slow you down and make you a prime target for the formula
Overall
Overall this is a DISAPPOINTING attempt at a fighting game The concept is good but the fighting engine is flawed Powerstone  got it right and is a blast read my reviewTHIS IS ABSOLUTLY THE WORST WWE GAME EVER CREATED THANK GOD FOR THQ IF THQ CAME IN ALL THE WWE GAMES WOULD HAVE SUCKED REALLY BAD DONT RENT THIS GAME DONT BUY THIS GAME DONT EVEN ASK FOR IT THE GAMEPLAY SUCKS THE VOICE OVERS SUCK CREATE A CHARACTER SUCKS EVERYTHING FOR THIS GAME SUCKS DONT BUY ITTerrible horrible very bad May be the worst game I ever played I despise it and its just no fun at allBeing a South Park fan I was looking forward to this title  However it is SO repetitive and annoyingthe turkey level alone goes on FOREVER  Friends of mine have had the same reaction  Its a firstperson shooter or should we say firstperson snowballer that just has you running around the town of South Park throwing snowballs at turkeys  Yeah I know according to the packaging that the game evolves into some sort of spacezombie creature thing and youre supposed to save the town but I never got that far due to the overlong turkeyshooting levelwhen I saw the average star rating I knew I had to respond  Perhaps younger people will like this due to the character tiein but this yearold was bored and disappointed in this titlePeople i wrote this review to warn whatever of you out there want to buy this game This will make even the most die hard game fans throw their playstations out the window The games has most of the characterswhoopiewhich are represented with sub bar graphics and pitifull level desighn amoungst other thingsthe games boring I rented it and it literally got old after  minutes of gameplay If there is one redemable factor about this game its that you can laugh at how utterly stupid it is Avoid this nerf dung at all costsPower comes on but AV does not work Be careful from where you purchase I read Tested and works great But it doesnt I ordered a NEW AV cable for Dreamcast and HOPEFULLY it works
Turns out it didnt work so it IS the AV Port Requested a refund it was approved sent system back but DID NOT get a refund I WILL file a claimGame play is either to fast or slow Controls suck Accuracy can only rarely be obtained  Despite this you get bumped up to the next level reguardless  The graphics deffinetly leave something to be desired like better ones  Dont waste your moneyFinally tested with a new game and the system doesnt work It just powers on and says insert game disc It will play all my cds just not game discs I dont recommend this seller as he said it was a working system and clearly had not tested it fullyCrashed in Vista  Codemasters told me they dont support it in Windows   Couldnt get it to work even after looking on the InternetI dont mind if the graphics arent completely state of the art but this was ridiculous  Not only were the graphics terrible but the rendering engine they used was pathetically slow and the effects were horrible  I  ran this game on a PMhz with a DDR GeFORCE video card and could not  enjoy the game at any decent resolution because of the huge frame hits you  would receive depending upon where in the track you were  Terrible  Even  at high resolutions the cars and tracks looked pixellated and cartoonish  I which is many years older than this game has graphics which kill NS  I am unbelievably dissapointedi thought this would be a good console i was very very dissapointed  it has very few good games and the graphics arent all that i expected from iti sold my DC and now i am waiting for the x boxI bought mine a year ago and i am very pleased with the system Its graphics are great and it is a lot of fun to play But the chances are that it will now be a dying system With Sega getting out of the hardware side means that the customer base will not grow While more and more PSX get into peoples homes the same cannot be said for the DC  There maybe  games still coming to the DC but as time goes on that number will deacrease A company is not going to bother with so small a market and that is what the Dc will become  Over the last few months I have seen DC games disappearing from the local stores as they decided to drop the line The local video stores around me have dropped Dc Tonight I found one stores entire DC gear including the systems they rented out up for sale The DC section had been replaced with PSX games  Sega will also be releasing games for the PSX and that alone should be saying alot for what Sega has in mind  Sega has admited defeat and will leave those that supported it high and dry The current price is very very good But it is consol taking its last breaths  Was the PSX heaps better I dont think so Not from what I saw I enjoy my DC immensly and played it for many many hours But its day is gone The future is the PSX A shame really both for Sega and for those who bought into what they thought was a excellent alternative to the big dollar consoles  Because of this I personally will not buy Sega gear in the futureLets sum up what is great about Dreamcast  Sensational graphics equal to PS great sound good controller design and an excellent although not outstanding software line up
Now what is so bad about the Dreamcast that I would rate it so low  Sega Corporation
If you havent heard the announcement yet Sega will not longer be making the Dreamcast console  This means that the chances of many more great new titles being developed is low  I am basing this statement from my experience with the Sega Saturn  Once the Saturn production was stopped only a handful of additional titles were released and very few stores stocked them
When I saw that Dreamcast was based on DirectX the same programming API as Windows for the PC I was very excited because I was sure that there would be a flood of titles for the Dreamcast  There are many more titles for Dreamcast but the flood of PC cross overs never materialized and the few that did come Urban Chaos Rainbow Six were bad
Now Sega has given up on their console and wants to make software for other companies  I believe that Sega owes its gamers a little more loyalty than it has shown and I hope that the gaming community reacts by not purchasing Sega software for any platform  My investment in a PS was good for  years  My Dreamcast lasted six months  Goodbye Sega purchases foreverTo be quite honest I found this to be the most tedious roleplaying game Ive ever played The narrative sequences are ridiculously long the graphics are mediocre and the mechanics of controlling other characters in combat is poorly designed I read a lot of good reviews of this game before I bought it and I was terribly disappointedI cant tell you what a piece of dog this game is Like everything else Microsoft makes it doesnt work When are they going to take a cue from Apple and make things that actually work the first time and every time To log onto this game they make you jump through a series of hoops that takes like  min to accomplish If you want another disappointment from Microsoft buy some Games for Windows Live games  I just wanted a simple arcade like driving game when I have a young boy visiting If thats what you want dont buy this If you want to hire a consultant to help you run this game then buy it  oh one more thing every time I do get this game to play my joystick stops working theres Windows  for youI bought this game way back and recently played it again well

the game was easy to beat when i was  and its still as easy

Well my problems

Not enough characters and its just not very fun and yeah that makes it boring but if ur a fan of the older games  like me  you may like this game  unlike me 

Its cheap now so I guess it wouldnt hurt to pick it up it costs as much cash as to rent a game at the videostore

so do what you want with itvery boring game  The graphics are the average  graphics that many  games had at the time  Very dull textures  Even though this game has a neat aspect of movement in every direction it still lacks fun gameplay  The music is very annoying and i have heard better on the SNES system quality wise  I dont reccomend this game even if you are a collectorI think after buying this my wallet is Forsaken I am Mistaken that this game is what I bought it came in a box called Forsaken I played this game about  times before giving it up cause I couldnt control the characters or understand the plot line  I know that I have skills but this game made me look stupid  Cut your losses and buy something else like Quake II now that rocksCosting as much as fifty dollars new at the time I nevertheless was suckered into buying two of these back in  or so when I played my N a lot

The thing is insanely sensitive and easy to break  The first stupid thing it does is in its use you put the Gameshark into the slot then stick the game up on top of it  As with many cartridge game systems it seems you need to wiggle it about and position it just right just for it to work  I remember spending several minutes during the last leg of my first Gamesharks life trying to adjust the game on top to be slightly lopsided because it simply would not work if I just pushed the cartridge down all the way like its supposed to

Of all the functions it has half of them dont even work  The function of basically making up new cheat codes based on gameplay regularly froze up games and at worst caused catastrophic damage to the Gameshark  I remember one instance I tried to create a new cheat code and ended up filling up my entire Gamesharks memory with useless information  Almost none of the preset games and codes worked names were screwed up with random characters and letters and largely I had to just guess which code would do what for which game

The fifteen minute instructional VHS that came with the Gameshark was a hilarious jokeboth VHSs had the little plastic tab on the bottom STILL INTACT  If you still remember how VHSs work this means ANYONE CAN RECORD OVER THE VHS IF THE PLASTIC TAB IS STILL INTACT  I could literally have recorded gay porn over the VHS packaged it with the Gameshark sent it back for a refund and they likely would have sent the VHS in a new package to be sold to someone else

Whatever benefits the Gameshark gives are simply not worth it in the long run  It doesnt ruin your game permanently but it ruins itself just fine  There was never any justified reason for the way my two Gamesharks just simply broke down and stopped workingRead ALL of the reviews for this product Every bad thing that has been said about it is true Very unreliable poorly built product Ive had mine only  months it froze up on me last week and hasnt worked since A few other people mentioned that customer service with this company is nonexistant Well thats true also Im really angry and disappointed with both this product and the company I mean Cmon these things are expensive Ill never buy anything from Interact againYou get some cheats with some games  BIG deal  This is nothing compared with how bad it is  This erased files in three of my games including Zelda  This also erased some of my friends games  Please do not buy thisInstalling the game was a struggle because of games for windows live bugs

Some championship races and cars can only be unlocked by buying them as an addon to the game I paid nearly  dollars when the game was new I dont like the idea that I have to keep paying to keep playing

I noticed no improvement in the physics or graphics compared to Dirt 

I tossed it in the garbage and vowed never to buy another codemasters game Im really tired of arcade style rallyracing games anyway

Ill continue to get my fix from Richard Burns Rally and you should to

Thank you for reading my review If you enjoyed it be sure to rate it as helpfulThis controller has to be one of the worst out on the market  It has a horrible design is made of cheap plastic and to make matters worse its  also highly priced  Dont even think about using it for games like Marvel  Vs Capcom because even casual play will break this controller  If youre  serious about games find an import controller made by another company  Dont even bother with the other Dreamcast controllers out in America they  are all just as bad if not worseOverly complex game  Start to finish there is nothing exciting included in this game  Whatever side you play starts with a great disadvantage and it just goes downhill from there  Not just a challenge each order is  monotonous and the game becomes disinteresting within an hour  Dont waste  you time or moneyI hate this game so much
I was warned that the game is difficult to learn I read the whole  page manual before installing it  I read the  page tutorial a second time before playing  After four hours of trying  to get the game to work I gave up  I have an engineering degree from MIT   so Im not stupid
The interface was the worst I have ever seen  for any nonUnix software  Nothing makes sense and CPO stands there and  insults you the whole time without giving any help
As it turns out I  had bad luck the first time I went through the tutorial  I had started the  game in a situation in which I could do nothing  Except that I didnt know  that since I had never played before
Imagine a game of chess with a  twist  Instead of all  pieces you flip a coin to see if you get any  particular pieceheads you get the piece tails you dont  Sound  interesting  Now imagine that you dont get your king  Now what  Thats  what the game is like  Actually its worse  Imagine that you are told  what the pieces do in a book  pages long but that you cant really see  them do anything  You cant even see the board  You have to provide   detailed instructions about how to move each piece and the instructions  dont make any sense  For instance I had a mineral mine that could go  through space but I couldnt make spaceships You dont know why you  lost
LucasArts should never have associated with this garbage  I  thought that I would never buy another LucasArts game again without playing  it first  But then I bought Rebel Alliance  Now I know Ill never buy  another LucasArts game without playing it first
I tried to give the game  away but my friend gave it back after one day  He said it was the worst  game ever It took him  minutes to figure out how to quit he goes to  Harvard I tried another friend but he gave it back Ph D Penn State  Industrial Engineering I tried another friend Psych major who gave it  to somebody else who finally threw it away but kept the action figure  I  guess that last guy never played the game because after being insulted for  four hours I dont know how anybody can like CPO ever again
I hate  this game so much  I regret ever getting it  In fact I couldnt play  other LucasArts games that I love for  months until I got over the  loathing toward that company I wish I could give it negative stars I have  yet to meet somebody flesh and blood who likes the game  My only wish  now is that I had burned the game slowly and watched the CD melt  This  game is a case study in horrible design and horrible interface  I wish I  could say that I learned something positive from the experience so well  nevermindApparently the way to win this game is to completely disobey your mission objectives  For instance in the last mission I played before uninstalling it and throwing it away I was supposed to pick up a container protect my  mothership by fending off the attacking tie fighters and fly to a  checkpoint to meet the rebellion  So I picked up the container and started  killing off tie fighters  I got them all  I was killing them as fast as  they were replaced  Then I got slammed with a dozen missles from all sides  and lost the mission  I never got notification to go to the next  checkpoint  The game has a help function after you lose a mission that  gives tips on how to win the mission the next time  The tip  Dont  protect the mothership  The checkpoint wont appear until the mothership  is destroyed  Besides if you attack the tiefighters then your container  will get destroyed and you wont be able to finish the mission  That might  be okay except that the game doesnt tell you that you cant complete the  mission  Once I just sat there for  minutes waiting for something to  happen  That was boring After four hours of finding out that I was  supposed to ignore mission objectives and do very little I uninstalled the  game and threw it away  My only regret is that now I wonder what would  have happened if I had destroyed the mothership myself This was a definite  waste of money and time  After my experience with Rebellion I am now  certain that I will never buy another LucasArts game without playing it  firstThis game was bought and rather farfetched I hoped it would work and It doesnt play story mode at all So Im stuck in training mode and can only play the first training session A shameIm slow to give a star rating but this certainly takes it  First the grip is hard  The grip it thin and small extends vertically from the controller  The ZButton on all three of the ones I got broke within a month after moderate use  The controller gets greasy SO easily  Never ever get this no matter how desperate you are to save moneyThis is just like an arcade game you play at a bowling alley or something  For those who like those kinds of games then maybe the game would work for you  But I found this game extremely boring and no funSave your money and get Roller Coaster Tycoon   or  Sim Theme Parks graphics look like total sThis is the Worst Game i ever bought the first time i bought it there was a problem with it and then the nd time its was still broken and had a problem with it dont waste ur money on it its so not worth it i still have the game but ive never been able to use it since its so messed upI thought this game looked like it would be great but it turned out that it was boring irritating not to mention that it has bugs my computer is almost brand new and this game would crash every five minutes A few months later I bought Roller Coaster Tycoon and I became addicted to it I LOVE it  If you are interested in this game I recommend that you buy Rollercoaster Tycoon instead its a lot more fun and it doesnt have bugs dont waste your money on Sim ThemeParkOk
Im a HUGE fan of Simstuff  I cant get over how clever they are how real they play out how absolutely consuming they can be
This product is not one of them
Its awkward its punchy and buggy It  restricts your creativity in a way that Ive yet to experience in any other  Sim game You are limited to two island scenarios to begin and they are in  themes like Dinosaur and Space Ship  and they are VERY tiny  not much  to work with  Creativewise you are stuck with rides that are typical to  that particular theme  IE your park attendees bounce up and down on a  dinosaurs stomache as one of the rides shudder
I think the game is  ideal for children  and under Its fun and quirky enough to entertain  them but its not what youd typically expect as an avid adult player  from a Sim game
Try Roller Coaster Tycoon if youre an adult fan of  simulated amusement park game software but even that gets a bit dull after  a while  its easy to win and repetitive
Or try The Sims its quite  entertaining and very well put togetherAs usual Interact accessories dissapoint This Tremor Pak jumps too hard for what is taking place on screen and absolutely sucks The slightest action on screen and it wants to jump out of you handnot good at all Instead of adding realism to a game it proves to ba an annoyance
AVOID AT ALL COST Get the official Sega Jump pak insteadThis thing does nothing but shake the heck out of your arms when you play It is at times comical It makes your controller rattle you hear shaking noises and feel like you are having some sort of seizure
This tremor pack thing will die off in my opinion It will go the way of Robbie the Robot for the NES Remember him Neither does anybody else
It is an interesting idea but it doesnt really enhance the games Just because the controller shakes in your hands doesnt mean you feel like part of the game In fact with all the shaking it might even disrupt your game play You are much better off getting a visual VMU to put in the front slot at least that enhances your gaming experience I have this tremor pack and after playing with it for a few hours I took it out and havent used it since Dont waste your money on it That is the best advice I can giveHey maybe Im doing something wrong but I havent been able to get this game to do much of anything the graphics are poor for this day and age and the controls were even worse I didnt play very long though so its not fair to say it truly stinks Maybe Ill try it again and see if I missed somethingThe game is honestly one of the best games ever However it has huge performance issues on modern computers rendering the game virtually unplayable If you are a stubborn die hard fan like me you will play it this way anyway Nobody plays online anymore who can blame them with the problems operating the game so do yourself a favor and just play starcraft  or something elseI ordered the wrong one  I downloaded and went to play it I got as far as single player and when I clicked on it it wouldnt start so thats the reason I couldnt play it  Gave it to a friendThe game will not load on my Mac The box says its supposed to This was a very big disappointment I was trying to get out of the shooter gamesI would like give this game  or  stars if I could get it to run Like others the game crashes on startup or in the game and Codemasters has been absolutely no help in correcting it Why they cant get their asses in gear pun intended and fix it I dont know but with so many folks reporting the problem it isnt just occasional I assume they either cant replicate the problem or just dont care Lacking any help from Codemasters Ive tried the various fan fixes including uninstalling Rapture D Also tried installing on Vista and Win  and that didnt help either which is a shame since from the other reviews it seems like a great racing simthis is an excellent game that really has some substance the graphics are not the best and it is oversahdowed by the bigger game final fantasy VII if FF was too long for you get breath of fire  the story is good and the battle system is greatOutlaws is a first person shooter set in the wild west The story line is you play the hero and have to rescue your daughter from the villan Built on a dated engine with wonky physics Dated graphics and a D design Very dull gameplay with no atmosphere and a box of rocks AI Gameplay is nothing but shoot the baddies Find key Open door Shoot more baddies Find another Key ect ect Outlaws is very dissapointingThis is a bad product no function withs the LOGITEC EXTREME D PRO I  do not have money tu burnYAWN Very boring disapointing game Terrible gameplay graphics bla bla bla The cinematics run at an extremely slow frame rate At least the music is kinda good I dont recommend this for any god damn gamer Starcraft is one of the most annoying games ive ever played Sure terran  marines give u a little laugh now and then but the controls are  frustrating You have to right clickwhy not the usual leftclick to  select units and you cant deselect them Building times are extremely long  and so are the units Gameplay on my PC is overall boring and slow on a  Pentium II  voodoo mb RAM I have only got up to the third terran  mission then finally gave up And whats up by only controlling  units at  a time The Command Conquer series lets you control all units you have on  screen Starcrafts ingame graphics arent that good FMV qualty is terrible  and Battlenet gives you a pain in the a because of its slow server and  few options Westwood online gives the player more options and is also  faster All in all i say the command and conquer series is better  go  play tiberian sun or red alert or any other CC game  SC isnt worth  your time or moneyThis is a very dissapointing system Slow loading Bad graphics and terrible games But it has a good controllerDo yourself a favor
Dont waste you money on these cheap SNES controller knockoffs
Youre far better off spending a few extra dollars buying the real thing
Bought it new and the buttons stopped working after only a couple of days
Thanks a lot TOMEE  I know what youre thinking I need another controller The generic cant be that bad I might not like it but Ill be able to play

No you will not You wll hate every minute of this

As others have said the buttons are actually ok but the dpad will drive you insane Rage quitinducing Dont bother go out to your local retro store and pick up an actual old SNES controller The price will be well worth it Ive pretty much thrown this in the garbage but I cant seem to bring myself to it for some reason but it deserves itAwful A real disapointment This game is confusing and boring much like civilization  The game cover made it sound much more exciting than it really was I bought it a while ago from Rinho and it was bran new then I was sooo dissapointed It takes forever to play the battles are cheesy and a waste of time If you are considering buying this game I reccomend you try it before you buy it Belive me its not even worth  Ive always been dissapointed with Sid Meiers games So I think Ill stop trying them If your considering this game try Imperium Galactica  Its awsome No comparison I hope you found this reveiw helpfulThis game is very difficult to control and it is extremely boring It may have been a great game six years ago but by todays standards this one is a definite loser Save your moneyThis game can be described in a few simple words boring repeaditive  bad pointlessI was a big fan of Parappa the Rapper and I was seriously disappointed with this sequel Its bad enough that you can beat it in  minutes but whats worse is that you wouldnt want to The music is just bad and that is inexcusable for a music game Where are all the catchy tunes I cant remember one line from this game whereas I have all of Parappa the Rappers songs memorized Its missing those great lyrics found in Parappa like my favorite Sunny in my life shes like a dice I cant tell which way to turn till I spice Skip UmJammer and get Parappai saw the TV comercial for this game and it looked pretty cool but when i got it for christmas it got very boring i mean all u do is try to get to the other end of the level with ur ball and collect cards so there isnt much to this game i wouldnt reccomend this game  many peopleWell it wont work at all I put it in my console and nothing I looked it over carefully to make sure I didnt buy someknock off but it even has etched trademarks ext It doesnt recognize the disk at all So I went to the Activision site to see if I could find some help on this game And this is what they said

This is what I am having problems with and have encountered getting technical  support a nightmare
Game Problems
 Going to instant action from the main game menu I am presented with a CTD Crash To Desktop which means the game crashes and your back at your desktop
 In The game you need to review crew status mission briefings etc well so far I can not view these do to they dont appear while in the game
Applied the latest patch v to correct allot of the bugs and CTD and still have the above problems
Now the Nightmare
 Web Sites mentioned do not work  Either receive a blank page  Not Found or Virtual Directory Access denied error
 Phone Support  They have changed their number already from the one in the manual Called the new number and was thrown into a loop from a dysfunctional automated phone system And then finally was told I was in a  minute call waiting queue
 EMail support  Received an auto response saying their email address is no longer valid I was then pointed to a new web site which pointed me back to the original Hasbro Interactive Dysfunctional web site
So I am preparing to send this piece of junk back for a refund This is the LAST HasbroMicrprose software that I buyThis game sucks ass period The new vehicles are ok sometimes but all are slow and horrible to control The new powerups are retarded  such as skis to go over water but at an even slower pace by  times The old vehicles and kooky characters are all gone as is the storyline and anything else fun from the original Oh by the way this was also made by a different company which is the reason for all this horribleness So  in summation stick to the first on e til they come out with a rd one on a new systemThis game is nothing more than a sick joke  Really the story absolutely sucks what motivates one through twenty hours of gameplay the humor tries to be funny but comes across as stale the environment is tedious and boring the difficulty is Schizophrenic ie hikes constantly especially when you fight against the Enclave  Its like the game itself is a parody of the original Fallout  If you want a masterpiece of a game buy the original Fallout instead of this junkI tried using the game on the PS and PS and neither worked This game is a lightscribe disc and looks to be mass produced by someoneWTF is this crap this is metroid not castlevainiathis sucks  PS stop making castlevainia into gay manga garbage it takes all the thrills and scary aspects out of it by making everyone look like a woman with multi colored hairWhen I received this game I opened it up and right away started installing it but wait in all the excitement i didnt notice it being in the cardboard CD holder and because it was the installation wouldnt work why Cause the CD was scratched beyond repair Good job Interplay I will right another reveiw when I receive my new package telling you if the game is as bad as Interplays packing jobIt doesnt make any sense  How can this game be considered a classic  It has WAY too many flaws for people to continue naming it best game of alltime or best Castlevania game youll ever play
I dont think so  If you want a real Castlevania game go play Castlevania  for the N  Thats how a Castlevania game should be done  Not like Symphony Of The Night which is basically a complete disaster with its many inexplicable problems
Dont believe me  You will soon enough  First and foremost Konami must think all Castlevania fans are forgetful and dumb  You see the game begins with you playing as Richter and youre back in the final stage of the previous Castlevania game fighting Dracula  This is ridiculous  I dont want to play THAT game I want to play Symphony Of The Night  You dont have to redo the final fight with Wart in the beginning of Super Mario Bros   So you shouldnt have to start off Symphony Of The Night by going back and fighting the final boss in the previous game  What the hell is wrong with Konami  This whole RichterDracula thing should have been removed
After thats over the REAL game begins but unfortunately thats not true  It doesnt begin yet  Immediately a screen is shown of Alucard running to the castle which you unfortunately have no control over  Once hes inside and the gate closes you can now play as him but wait a minute  Theres no music playing in the background  A game cant really start if theres no music because the absence of music makes a game feel empty and unexciting
Luckily my worst fear didnt come true that Konami forgot to put music in the game and you just have to move forward a few steps and battle a few more foes before the music kicks in  Its about time  You had me worried there
But then more problems arise  In the same little area where the music kicks in you encounter these zombies that come out of the ground and walk towards you and many times you never see these zombies coming until its too late and you take a hit  Pesky little things like this are just one of many reasons this game is almost completely unbearable
Eventually you meet up with a young lady named Maria  Shes extremely attractive and knows just how to push the right flirting buttons  And thats a big problem  The way she seems to come on to Alucard and practically drool all over him is such a turnon to the player that its very difficult to move forward and continue on with the quest  After a Maria encounter you cant stop thinking about her beautiful pale face those big beautiful eyes that smooth relaxing voice and so then what happens after that is when you are in the middle of a serious battle you almost always die because you cant stop thinking about Marias beautiful face
Konami must not understand that mostly boys play video games  I shouldnt have to say it but I think its obvious that the creators of Maria are disappointed in themselves for creating such a goodlooking woman because one look at Maria distracts boys everywhere  They shouldnt have made her look so pretty  Because of this only the strongest male gamers will be able to complete this Castlevania adventure  Had she been less attractive guys would be able to better concentrate on the game
Youre probably thinking by now Alright talk about the actual GAME  Okay I will but you wont like what I have to say  Its just really painful for me to pick out all the problems in this supposed classic  Basically it all boils down to one thing  The fact that some weapons in this game are incredibly slow weak and almost useless  Yes Im talking about the Jewel Sword and the Sword Of Hador  Konami never should have put these two weapons in the game  But because they did we have no choice but to put up with them and I have no choice but to complain  These two weapons really drag the game down
I could go on and on about the many problems you will see in this game  Twice in the game you will have to fight a guy who looks exactly like you which if you ask me lacks creativity  Konami wasted a good opportunity right there to come up with new and exciting bosses to fight but no they had to go with the old predictable mirror match
Many enemies have blood fiercely squirting out of their bodies when you attack them forcing me and my children to look away from the TV screen  Because me and my children understand that if we look at the screen and see this violence we will throw up all over ourselves and even worse we might even have trouble making it through the day without screaming in fear that the same brutal treatment might happen to us if were not careful  A little bit of blood is fine but some of the blood in Symphony Of The Night is a bit too graphic and plentiful  Its enough to terrorize you  So the best thing to do would be to try and jump over these bloody enemies so you wont have to attack them though in many places avoiding enemies wont be easy
Finally the biggest problem  The second castle in the game is just the first castle turned upside down so its not really a new castle  Now thats what I call clumsy  Between the smutty actions of Maria and the blood all over the place it feels like Im watching a porno blood fest  Not a pretty thought is it  So as you can see many problems prevent this game from being a classic  Dont even think about buying itA lot of good reviewstwo perfect  star reviews even Amazoncom gets to choose which reviews are featured so thats not really much of a surprise
You should definitely read more reviews The graphics are okay but the design of the graphics in this game are considered to be very cartoonish by many Bright oranges glowing blues and odd color assortments await you in this game Do yourself a favor and search for the original Battlezone That was a game I played so many years ago I cant even remember when but I remember clearly the missions and the specific gameplay elements because it was so good The story made more sense the missions didnt tell you exactly what to do you had to figure it out which was the fun part and the overhead map was accessible from the push of a button rather than getting out of your vehicle all of the time To summarize what these reviews on the first page are all leaving out
 Youll have to get out of your vehicle constantly Because the drivers of other vehicles just arent smart enough to do the job themselves Youll also have to do this to access the tactical map the only way of ordering units around without actually driving there by which time the units in question will have already been destroyed too little too late
 Missions arent involving and the story doesnt continue from the original game In short theres really not much of a story as youll find yourself doing strange things that youve been ordered to do for no apparent reason
 Interface is cluttered buttons rearrange themselves based on the order that you built things and its a nightmare finding the right keys to press during the heat of battle In many games the only deciding factor of whether youll win or lose is if you find the right keys fast enoughThis game stinks Anyone who liked the intense and realistic qualities of the first Army Men game will be disappointed with this effort The  player mode has been destroyed the beautiful graphics and environments are gone the fast and smooth control is gone there are no more allies to assign for  attack or defense the operation of hand grenades bazookas and mortors is  inferior in the one player mode the tank is not able to smash a wooden  fence There is an annoying arrow at the feet of the character which points  you in the direction of the enemy thus taking the fun and suprise out of  setting ambushes the global ban on land mines has reached this game as  players are not able to set mines The sound effects have been emasculated  no piercing death screams No jeeps no  caliber guns This game must  have been designed for the N as it does not come close to living up to  the high standards of the st game Army Men Dfor the Playstation  If you like combat reality games buy the  excellent Medal Of Honor it is everything that this game is notI rented this game from blockbuster and hated it I played it for about three minutes then turned it off The graphics are pukey the controls are pukey the sound is pukey and everything around it is pukey Dont rent it dont buy it Thank YouHated it  constantly fighting the controls and it wass just terrible all in all will never buy an old tomb raider againI got this game for ten bucks on the bargain pile It blows it is a boring extremely hard game I liked the movie option graphics and real car phisics The story was okay not great The controls were horrible The missions are extremely unforgiving and hard boring The first mission took us  weeks to fufill Also your stuck in the car driving around The missions are so hard by the time you know how to beat them its just memerizing a boring path Its not even challenging fun It is more like boring impossible Also you cant see in front of you Im still on the first city On the good side you can go to a option you have called take a ride which allows you to go out and wreck havac in the city and have cops chase and then turn the car chases into movies Also there are driving games like pursuit and Getaway carnage surviver and time trials ect There fun for a while you can also turn them into movies Also I think this has much improovement from the PS version by far But still this game is horrible The story mode is by far the most hard boring and unforgiving Ive ever seen If you want a fun wide variety driving game for the PC reserve GTA

 So if you want a wide variety driving game where you can get out of a car and get in another and more mission variety reserve GTAThis rumble pak is too big uses up batteries rapidly its so heavy that you hardly ever feel the rumble Nintendo should have builtin rumble in thre controllers this sucksI read lots of great reviews for this game that made me want to play it  It will not play on my XP  Talked to a lot of other gamers that tried to help but nothing worked  Am holding onto it in case I can get a chance to play it on another computer  I dont think it is XP compatibleI was excited when i got this because i had trouble finding the right one However when first plugged in it seemed to work fine Then after only  min of game play it stopped working on ch Ch worked but it was fuzzy and no sound I then called the company i purchased it from and they offered no help Not happy about this productWhat I expected was another Total Annihilation but obviously I was at err I dont know who made this game but if it was the original design team of TA then they were smoking somethin that made pretty colors dance across the screen Ok bottom line TA kingdoms is by far the worst possible  stradegy game ever It is SO slow on my P mhz computer after I got  about  units or so it was ridiculas I mean it was like watching your  units walk through glue because the game slows down so bad it took my  little army of  units  minutes to reach the enemy base Also D  acceleration for this game is nonexistent In the original TA the computer  cheated but it wasnt to an extream sence here they made it tenfold  Whenever you arent looking over the enemys base they make units in   seconds or less they can make thousands of units with only one lodestone  in place its ridiculously IMPOSSIBLE in skirmishwhen you are just getting  your defences finished they will have those plus a  army coming to  attack your base and just plain weird in campaign mode Do not buy this  game buy the original TA its WAY better trust me Avoid Kingdoms like it  is a urine cup used to serve apple juiceWhen I got this game I played it for about  days and decided it sucks
Then after a couple of weeks I played it again because some friends said it was cool I thought I should give it another chance and I played it with friends but the game just doesnt appeal to me
Its quake  for me even though  was a bit disappointing
I dont get how everyone just seems to like UT
This is the game that got me back to playing games that actually have a storyI dont know what everyone else sees in this game and why they consider it so addicting and cool it like Quake  is just mindless shooting only leaving you angry Everyone in the UT community rocket jumps a cheap way of getting a quick kill and very annoying at the same time This game is plagued with rocket jumping There are alot of things I hate about this game too many to list here anywayI got this on sale and decided to have a look based on its low price and  star rating  What a joke
Its like Starcraft with bad graphics zilch instructions and awful controls  There are better games out there that are freeIm writing this review about amazoncom on this game I purchased because either Amazoncom or the Seller has issues What is pictured is the BLACK labeled for sale and under sellers or Amazoncom have no idea about these things maybe They also have the greatest hit So this pretty much is lieing to US the consumer about the product we are trying or about to purchase Everyone just watch out because if you want the BLACK label game and you may receive the GREATEST HITS version of the gameI am only left asking how long until Daikaitaina    HaHaHaHaHaHaHa
I really tried to like this game
I felt like screaming Turn the lights on during the first level What a murky morass I installed this game twice and I still cant stand it
What angers alot of gamers is this We wonder what games didnt get made because Daikajokea sucked up so much cashI rue the day this title came out for Playstation It was considered so original it influenced many many stealthtype games that followed it Too many

Where do I start with the things I hate about this game

 Its way too difficult You get awfully sick of hearing Snaaaaaaaaaaaaaake every  seconds There should have been a way to ratchet down the difficulty even further for tards like me Easy mode really isnt  Sheesh  I wonder what Hard mode was like

 Way too many cutscenes Ive never seen anything like it Theres one cut scene that goes on for like  minutes This has got to be the talkiest video game Ive ever played  And these dialogues are all so silly and youre pretty much forced to watch them or you wont be able to understand whats going on In fact I would say that most of your time in this game will be spent watching cutscenes Its not so much a video game as a movie in which you are occasionally allowed to press buttons

  I hate video games that wont let you pause at certain moments as this wont  I wouldnt advise playing this if you have a wife or mother whos gonna occasionally ask you to help her in the kitchen  youll find yourself saying Yeah Ill help you after this scene finishes    in about half an hour  Not allowed to pause it for some reason

  Even more excusably theres not way to pause the cutscenes  You cant even pause the codec dialogues

  There are many scenes in which the game disables your weapons and accessories for no logical reason other than that if it didnt the scene would be too easy

  There are far too many boss monsters  Its like every other encounter is a boss monster  The first part of the game say up until the first encounter with Revolver Ocelot is pretty great but thats not representative of the game  after that its basically an unending series of boss monsters

  Frustratingly you have to fight several boss monsters twice because they never seem to die  Having to kill the same boss monster over and over again makes you feel like youre going in circles

  The principals having these deep discussions about delicate emotional issues while an enemy is shooting at them or while a timer is ticking down Was this written by a yearold

  The system for flattening oneself against a wall is not ready for prime time  most of the time you find yourself flattened against the wall and you didnt mean to do this  This will get you killed several times as you are thus basically standing still allowing your enemies to shoot you  It should have been running up to a wall in combination with pressing L or something

  The way your guy stands there uselessly for about two seconds after choking somebody

  The way you can easily bypass critical lifesaving devices such as the thermal goggles

  The way the game takes all these cheap shots at you  you cant look ahead because your radar is jammed and then you get shot by a security camera  Or blown up by a mine

  The way you are prevented after having killed a boss from going back into the battle area and collecting the stuff you didnt collect during the battle  Is it there or not  So why cant I get it now

  The absurd antinuclear message at the games finaleI am going to make this short but true  First off this game is HARD or at least what I played this game is no Shoot them all like Quake  or anything  I found this game Repugent  I dont even want to try it again  I dont care if you have  weapons if you cant beat the first stage  with Ease then forget about the rest  The Graphics in this game are  Dated back to the DOOM age  This  year opus did not pan out like I  wanted  I really thought John Romero actually had some skill but it seems  not  The game might have good points but the save system save only if you  have a crystal is an abomination  This is a horrible idea which is seen  way too much in Console System games but never should have made it to the  PC  I admit Ion Storm Made has made a killer game Deus Ex but this one  is just a pile of turds  Bargin Bin Box  I also just want to close with  this  We can now see the real genius behind Doom and Doom  was John  Carmack not John Romero  Sorry about being rude and mean but this game  is really horrible and I just want to be honestDont ever ever buy this game I knew it was going to be bad So far this game beat the record for the shortest stay in my hard drive even beating Trespasser by  days A game that took  years to develop well you know  somethings not right Lets start with the graphics Really very dated  OpenGL graphics If this game came out  years ago it wouldve been  awesome Interface No InGame save Only way to say your progress is by  picking up Save Gems No Gems no save Control Ok so its like any other  first person shooter which is why I gave this game its one and only star  AI very very bad Talk about having your AI teammates to back you up  Youll be saving them most of the time instead of them helping you Also  there is a tendency that your artifical teammates to hit you by mistake  Story just watch the old TV series Time Tunnel Overall spend  your money on another gameAfter all the years and all the hype I expected that this game would have something to recommend it  Sure I realized it wasnt going to be the GAME TO END ALL GAMES  I always make sure to discount  for hype  But  my gods what a poor showing this is
There is next to no innovation  The graphics look like they were salvaged from Quake the puzzles are of  the annoying find the panel that opens the door way the hell over  there and backtrack etc style  The sense of immersion is zero  The  sounds are poorly choosen  The enemies are for the most part utterly  uninspired  The load times between segments which uses the HalfLife  formula are ridiculously long  Its also utterly unstable and prone to  crashing at any given moment
Well you get the point  If this were just  another generic first person shooter that was being sold from  on the  discount rack maybe I wouldnt feel so annoyed  As it was I went back  and exchanged it for Soldier of Fortune which well also not  ground breaking is solidly entertaining and at least mildly  innovative
Please folks dont get sucked in by the hype  Save your  money for something better  In the meanwhile Ill be hoping that Ion  Storms next big product Deus Ex does a better job of living up to its  reputationThis game is more fun than having a bag of hammers dropped on your head but not by much A game where you rely on stealth and not your trigger finger is a good idea but I CANT SEE ANYTHING I knew that I was in trouble on the very first mission It went like this  Me Where am I Is this a wall or a door Ill just open it Guard Hey Me Oops Guard kills me The End
Wow That was fun HooboyI have little patience when it comes to games like this  Makes me wish I hadnt bought it and I am still trying to get rid of it  Before buying take mine I will mail it to you before I hurl it through the wall  EGM  said this was a good game and usually they are right  Well they blew it  this time  Dont get me wrong it might be fun  Good concept interesting  story  Terribly frustrating gameplay and absolutely ridiculous boss  fights  I never knew the playstation load time to be this irritating until  I died  times in a row  O YE OF LITTLE PATIENCE AVOID THIS ONEStraight up this is a substandard D environment game lacking originality and fun looking to catch the little kids with its high cute factor If you want an action game this isnt the place to look This game is my worst PlayStation game EVERNever before in my gaming experience have I been turned off from a game in the first minute of game play

The biggest pro in this game is the fact that you can fart and burp and that my friends is a sad sad thing indeed

The programmers could have saved the gaming community the misery and not released this albatross at all Heck I probably would have paid them the  bucks I bought it for not to put it on the market and it would have been a winwin for everyone

I love GTA Its a great game but why does the  NES Super Mario Bros have superior graphics to a PS game from  It defies rational explanation and this game defies all rationality itself

I am ashamed to call this a GTA game or even a product from RockstarI had this game a while ago I loved it almost as much as I loved the SNES version I liked being able to play a girl and to get a cat and I also liked that this was back when you could decently play the game and turn a good ingame profit WITHOUT the optional help of the sprites all other HM recently Ive noticed you NEED themId rather do the farming myself than pay a stupid lil sprite to do itbut I was sorely disappointed that the marriage system is completely missing from this game

And thats not the worst of it

This is a real time game and after a while either it decides youre not playing enough or the time system just breakseither way unless you play it almost nonstop it will start killing your plants and your livestock will mysteriously hate you

Its good fun while it lastsbut it doesnt last long enough to even win itGiven that I have upset many people with my controversial view of this cough classic I decided to give it a second chance
Lets see lets put it through the test
Graphics  out of  it fits on the Gameboy Color thats pathetic for a PSX
Sound  out of  fairly decent sound effects bad music
Controls  out of  these are the worst controls ever
Fun Factor  out of  I still returned it the next day
So there you have it  This is a very bad game and I would rather have my tounge frozen to a pole with rabid poodles knawing at my ankles than play this again  Word of advice buy a PS and get Grand Theft Auto  you will not regret that financial investmentI thought the Clock Tower games looked interesting but I was sorely disappointed  The controls pointandclick are outofdate and sometimes do not make sense the voice acting is AWFUL the movements are SLOW the  graphics are mediocre the storyline as much as I could handle was  corny  There are many endings to the game but who can sit through  it
VERDICT  Dont even rent this one unless you are a HUGE and  curious fan of the first gameOkay is this a April fools joke this game is terrible mortal kombat in D what were they thinking this game is bad really bad mk in D that just puts the other ones to shame so midway check your mk games before bringing them out because this game just sucks dont even buy it i dont recommend it to any mk fan the controls are terrible so i could go on but theres so much wrong with this game thats why i gave it  starsThis wwf game sucks
BoringGraphics are alrightIt was just plain awful EVEN FOR ITS TIME
UGH this game was slo get this game
GET NO MERCY  BEST WWF GAME EVER
This game was very dull and boring
If I could give it a zero I wouldTHIS GAME FLAT OUT SUCKS
good thing I Baught this for a  bucksBut still that was a waste
LaterIs this series still around Why This game gets old REAL fast and is a waste a time I honestly cannot think of one positive thing to say about this game The music isnevermind Well the graphics areforget I said anything Thanks a lot MidwayThis game is fun until it freezes one two three four five times in a single day of playing I think the vendor sold this copy because it was defective Not my first time experiencing this issue years ago it was the same thing But with games going down in quality who can blame me for taking a chanceThis game is not the version I remember It feels very clunky and the load times are hardly tolerable Try another version for your MK fixI hate this game  Let me state right away graphics in a WWE wrestling game mean absolutely NOTHING to me  The graphics in WWF War Zone are pretty good and original back in the day but who cares  It seems the only thing wrestling video game fans today are interested in is looking at their television set in amazement because the wrestlers look realistic and their movements true to life  Who cares  When War Zone first hit the scene in the late s yeah the graphics WERE cool  Not now especially when the only thing the WWE cares about these days is impressing gamers with realism

You know WWF War Zone was the very first game that brought the graphics to a whole new D level  A whole new level of crap  You see it makes me sick that the WWE wrestling games for  years now are all basically the same  Let me explain why this is a bad thing

You know when you buy an updated sports video game such as football or hockey and the only thing different about it from the previous year are a couple new player names and maybe some new options here and there  Thats exactly what the WWE has done with their video games  For the last  years all the WWE games have been WAY too similar to each other and it completely sucks out the fun when every new wrestling game that hits the market only offers a slight difference over the previous years game

It doesnt matter if its Smackdown Smackdown  WWE Raw for the Xbox WWE Wrestlemania for the Gamecube etc  Those games are all the same a lousy attempt to impress gaming and wrestling fans with realism  Im all for realism but it DOES NOT MATTER in a wrestling game  A wrestling game is like any other video game in that it SHOULD be all about having fun with it  And I cant have fun with a wrestling game released today that more or less is exactly the same as a wrestling game from  years ago  It makes me sick to think  years later hardly anything has changed in the world of wrestling video games

Before WWF War Zone you had WWF In Your House which to this day is a game that completely stands apart from other WWE wrestling games along with WWF Wrestlemania The Arcade Game  Before those games you had the buttonsmashing delight of WWF Raw on the Super NES and Sega Genesis  Once again the formula in those oldschool wrestling games didnt stick around and overstay its welcome  Over  years with games just like WWF War Zone IS too much

The very second WWF War Zone came out on the Playstation and N it all went wrong  Game companies got the idea that people wanted realism in their wrestling games so from that point on ALL the WWE games had to be about having realisticlooking gameplay and wrestler appearances and the fun factor washed away like sandcastles on the beach  Its hard to have fun with a game when the year before you were playing the same thing  After a while you get sick of it

WWF War Zone is an innovative game for taking wrestling to new heights but it was the WORST thing that could have happened  Graphically WWF War Zone is the first of its kind  Being the first means its bound to have some flaws despite the fact that existing is its biggest flaw  Another MAJOR problem with the game is how SLOW it is  After the adrenalinerushing WWF In Your House we now experience wrestlers walking around in the ring VERY slowly  Painfully slow in fact  Going from WWF In Your House to WWF War Zone is like going from a cheetah race to a snail race  Your grandparents can wrestle each other faster than the wrestlers in this game  To be fair the ONLY thing WWF wrestling games today have improved is the speed  Everything else is the same as it was  years ago

WWF War Zone also started the popular create a wrestler mode  But it doesnt matter because as I mention above wrestling games for  years have had that option  Its an option that has lost its charm because of overkill and its time game companies got rid of it or did something to drastically change it  It was a fun and interesting idea at first but now  years later I dont want to have it in a wrestling game ever again

I tried getting rid of WWF War Zone at a yard sale but no one wanted it so I had to get rid of it by throwing it away  No way was I keeping such a crappy game in the same shelf with MUCH more deserving Playstation games

If only WWE was more innovative with their wrestling games today instead of repeating the same formula every year I wouldnt have to keep going back and pointing out WWF War Zone as the game where the downfall began  After  years updating the graphics and adding just a few new options and wrestlers doesnt get the job doneI first bought this game in a Hastings book store a long time ago and Ive been a Mk fan for quit some time so I went ahead and bought it thinking This is great Ive got MK trilogy that has all of my favorite characters in it And Midway makes really great gamesLOL And I managed to find it in a five dollar bin This is truly a lucky day for me
Until I played it

Then as time went on I kept it in my basement and then one day I decided to bring it out because I hadnt played it in a while and I forgotten all of the moves So I went to the options menu and put it on a pansy level so I can get the feel for it again Then I remembered why I put it the basement What I should have done was bury it in the back yard never to see the light of day again
As soon as the first round said FIGHT I might as well thrown in the towel The game was gracious enough thou to just stand there for two seconds and let me get one shot in even thou I was  dead anyway I mean what the F is the point

I dont even think the skill level even works
The only way to make it up the ladder without facing brutalities and stage fatalities is if you were to play as Kintaro hes your best bet
If you play as Motaro you will get your a handed to you literally Pun intended  The AI actually puts any character to uppercut him and send him flying almost out of view of the screen But if you were to uppercut the AI Motaro he only staggers cant have him flying into the air oh no that would require fairness in the game

MK has been known for the copy and paste routine on characters and MK Trilogy is the crowning achievement of it The male and female ninjas and if a guy has a bike helmet and armor pads that they bought down over at WalMart and calling them cyborg ninjas you know this is a cheap a game What the hell was this game made off of a  budget I guess WalMart was selling helmets and bike armor pads on a half off sale

If the Matrix was to take a glitchy  Im sure that it would look something like this For every time it loads a match I can actually hear my PS one groaning like it was trying to pass a cinder block
If that PS could talk itd say Oh lord please help me 

I can see now why it was in five dollar bin but I remember that there was a trash bin next to it and if I knew then before I bought it I would have said Hey this is in the wrong bin

Its hard to take this gory game seriously if that douche bag Dan Fordans big fat head keeps popping out saying Toasty I wouldnt be a damn bit surprised if I saw Charley Sheen popout of the corner and say Already got your money dude

And when it says on the back of the game Seven humiliating stage fatalities that sends your opponent plummeting to there embarrassing death Thats you your the opponent The AI will make sure of that

As for brutalities who the hell takes the time to flush there life away to memorize twelve different moves just to do one lousy move so a guy explodes Wow I never seen five skulls and twenty femur bones pop out of a guy a before Apparently Ed or any of the designers of this pile of  game doesnt know a damn thing about the human anatomy Its bad enough that you have to remember all the fatalities and trademark moves now this

To sum it up
The game play was awful
The AI is cheap
Glitchy as hell
They copy and paste the characters as they always do
The option menu is useless
The video resolution looks like it was filmed through a potato
The audio is awful
And the story sucked

Forget waterboarding Forget Guantanamo bay That would be considered a health spa compared to this game S force a terrorist to play this game for  hours strait and hell tell you on how to cure any form of cancer

I cant believe how these retailers on here are pricing this POS at  Hell theres some retailers on here that are ranging this torture device at  Yeah good luck with that guys You let me know how well that works out for ya
Any poor bastard that was unfortunate enough that played this atrocious inhumane intolerable game with a brain stem knows this game couldnt be given away

This game is ranked right next to the Jumanji board game both should be thrown into the sacred ark welded shut put into a create and shipped to a warehouse somewhere and there it will be dealt with TOP MEN Because this game will melt your face off while youre screaming in agony

Looking back on my teenager days where I was young dumb full of   and didnt know any better I was easily manipulated into crap like this So of course I would defend games that I didnt know anything about Of course I would deny that Ive been taken advantage of  And now we see the same types of teens that are doing this all over again Theyll read this review and say Oh how dare you talk that way about MK Even thou I didnt grow up with it bla bla bla I doubt that any one of them ever played this game on a PS  Theyd argue that theyd played it of off their iphone or somethin and say its the same thing NO By then the bugs have been fixed and its NOT THE SAME YOURE PLAYING IT FROM A PHONE It has to be from a PS Hell to them theyd considered it a retro game They cant judge a game accurately that wasnt in their childhood All they can do is look at it from a future point of view As for us s babies we grew up with this crap Its only right that we judge it from OUR timeline no one elses  And its hard even to this day to let go of something that even thou Ive been scammed by marketingploys by some cheap broken product I grew up with them But ultimately you have to say to yourself that Ive been had and its time to let go

I would not recommend this game to anyone unless you enjoy yelling at your TV screen all night then look no further
But if you care about your sanity and want to keep it intact Then stay the hell away from this thing  Youll find no entertainment from it And thats where it fails it fails at what the main purpose of this game was made for ENTERTAINMENT

All it will do is poison and scar your mind for life Youll never be the same again
Youll feel cheated lied to manipulated used frustrated raped and robbed
Thats what youll be left with EnjoyCause thats what your gonning to be doing alot in the entire game Move this block move that block Put this block over there  make sure its fits in place with the correct image matching the wall
And flip  stack them too Now pull this lever  go to the next room over  do more block puzzles Fun right Such a load crap

Everything is very cryptic
Nothing is explained

Lame powers

Poor boss fights

Easy to get lost

You have to shift inbtween worlds to advance
But somehow this also changes the areas shape too

How does that work
It doesnt Hes shifting from life  dead
Not to another Dimension

Your life bar also changes shape  size too for we reason

Your walking makes this god aweful sound

Humans you meet dont speak a lick of english  also make a annoying fake gibberish

Lame ending bossLooking for rise off of naked blue men with green capes reminding you of your hero to save you Well this game is for you I first got introduced by one of my friends I mean an acquaintance His favorite games soon showed me that he really wasnt all that bright He said In a gay womenly voice Hey try this game out So I said hey what the hell As I took it home I hid it away so no one would see it So I popped it into my Playstation and even it rejected it So after a couple of trys it finally ran So the title screen appearedI never knew this was an alienvampire porno flick The idea of impailing naked green Slaughs as their called in the game isnt my idea of a thrill After killing them their balls shoot out numbing the mind into thinking why the main character would have to eat them to gain energy Wow now I know im scared Then the mysteriousnes of tredding through the two mystical worlds one retartedanother more retarted is as amazing as tredding through a piece of sht Answer me this If a vampiregay alien has his mouth ripped off how can he eat balls or talk Its amazing Feed on the balls of your enemies Explore the vast pieces of crap and an extra bonus its a ball buffet The main character is not only a gay alien but is supposedly a vampire His arch enemy is another vampire but is aboutI dont know a billion times better then him Just a rough estimate The most amazing complex part of the gameplay is his amazing three hit combo WOW THREE HITS Then press x to dodgelunge and triangle to impale Oh the complexity My mind strains over this sht Well if you like to get off to blue alien like menGo for but I suggest you dont waist your moneyMortal Kombat Mythologies sucked just as much as the other MK Adventure games Those being of courseSpecial Forces and Shaolin Monks The storyline in this game is set years and years before the first MK Tournament took place I guess you could call it a prequel The gameplay is absolutley terrible The controls are very unresponsive and there are WAY too many cheap hits that you take in this game MKM mixes both repetive digitized graphic gameplay and awful acting in FMV sequences As many have saidthis game is extremly difficult HellI had a VERY hard time beating itwith cheat codesand with it being on very easy All this mostly due to all the cheap hits that you get hit with by different enemies There is also puzzle solving as well Most of which will have you pulling out your hair OverallThis game is crap and you shouldnt waste one dollar on it Avoid this and the other two MK adventure titles as wellThis controler stinks  The joystick is messed up and turned at a slight angle so you have to go slightly up and right to go straight up the rubber grips fall off in the first week and worst of all its confusing  I tried programing the buttons because its fully programable and believe it or not it works  sure you cant train whole sets of commands like moves in fighting games in only replot the buttons but it works  The only problem comes in when you accidently press the clear button with a light in it and all of the sudden none of the buttons perform the X action  Then this controller will probably be unplugged and sent to the attic just like mine  EnjoyI used to love playing Quake  I played it for hours on end When I heard about its impending release in  I was stoked and could hardly wait for it to come out And what did I do when it did I played it AT LEAST  to  days a week from  to early  And guess what I became freakin sick of it I do not want to play this game ever again for the rest of my existence on this earth Well at least for  years or so My point is after you log hours and hours of gameplay it starts to get old FAST Quake  may be a legendary game but I warn you dont overindulge Play Max Payne Deus Ex or Unreal Tournament  insteadWhere to begin with this train wreck of a game  Twisted Metal  is like an abomination that should have never been made   ruined the whole spirit and everything that made Twisted Metal  one of the best games ever made  The only thing I would give this sequel over the previous game was that the cars graphically look a little better  The game is so frustrating from the controls that it makes it no fun to play  Everything got worse instead of better

Story and Characters
They brought back the taxi from the first game added a grandma and a Flower Power s car  Yeah not a lot else needs to be said all  suck  They got rid of some of the fun characters from the nd game like Shadow and Mr Slam for those  and changed some of the names probably a copyright issue between the companies  Not a big deal but still why not just keep the names the same  The story is pretty much the same but uses D graphics instead of the animation theme  I personally thought the animation from  was great and added a lot of fun to the game  I loved beating TM with each character to see the multiple endings  This game is so frustrating you will get none of that same enjoyment from this game

Play Control
Is ridiculous in this game it is way over responsive to the point where it is hard to even drive the vehicles  Just driving over power ups seems like a chore to pickup when they should be easy  The wonderful freeze element in TM does not work near as well in this game  The play control in TM was outstanding every vehicle was easy to learn and play  Not so in this monstrosity

Stages  Backgrounds
The stages and backgrounds seem cramped and you dont get the feel of exploration you did in the previous game  The cars all stay pretty close to you so you dont do much searching for opponents on the other end of stages  Gone are the fun elements of Antarctica falling to pieces or environmental dangers such as Moscow or the ruins of Latin America surrounded by lava  Instead you get Egypt The North Pole Washington DC London and Tokyo  None of which is very exciting I found the background boring and uninspiring

Challenge
This game is cheap as hell but not in the way you would think  Instead of all the cars fighting each other it seems like all the opponents just gang up on you alone so the odds are always  to  or  to  instead of even  When you get a few opponents life bars way down they run off looking for your health powerups thats right they wimp out stop engaging and run for health before they start attacking you again  When I first saw this in the game I thought you have to be kidding me  What programmer would add that in  It really ruins the gaming experience and is frustrating  When I died in TM I was eager to start the stage over and get revenge on the car that destroyed me but that does not really happen in this game because it takes so much longer just to destroy an enemy car because they are running after health the whole time  The bosses are pretty much the same I thought the final boss was not unoriginal The radar in this game is not nearly as good as with the previous game making it hard to track your prey and see where they are at on the grid

Verdict
Avoid this game like the plague  The cars and graphics may look better but you will have a better time beating your head against a wall that playing this game  the endings and stories are not as good the play control is awful  The challenge is way to high because of cheap tactics The radar is not really helpful  All in All it is the worst game in the series  I hated this game save your money or just buy the Twisted Metal  or

Fun FactorReplay Value Absolutely the worst game in the excellent Quakes This certainly bombed the whole trilogy with its gameplay What I hate about this game is the nonstop mindless shooting where you dont have to think Getting killed in this game also causes alot of anger because everyone just jumps around you and constantly fires This game is just like UT bad Utterly bad I have constantly tried to like it but failed at every attempt Avoid at all costsI really like the game but the person I bought it from doesnt test the games and now I have a game that I cant even start because the first disc doesnt read please do not buy from this person because I paid good money for a paper weightIf you want yet another dogfight game here it is  If you want a game where you feel as though you are commanding a starship as depicted in the Star Trek movies you had better pass  Cut scenes  Wow impressive and  with David Warner no less  Graphics NONE BETTER  Neat way to blow stuff  up  Oh yea  A great game for those under  with cat like reflexes  No  cunning needed here  However you had better be more practised in an  immelman turn than the corbomite bluff if you want to suceed at this game  and that precisly is the opposite of what is advertisedAlthough a lot of people liked this game I hated it For one thing this game was WAAAAYYYYYY too easy I beat this game in three days playing only   hour a day The first game had me playing for mounths  Youre supposed  to find this fairy to give you all your powers back and yet you start the  game with all your powers Plus I dont care how good the graphics are  Rayman does NOT look good in D and does not belong in D So get the first  game I dont recomend this game to ANYONE  And you know whats worse  This Nintendo  vertion looks WORSE and plays WORSE than the Dreamcast  vertion  Now thats sad Even though I never liked NGood gravy  What was Squaresoft thinking when they made this one  Its terrible in almost every aspect

First of all the battle system involves having to siphon off magic spells from the enemies and grafting them into your abilities  This means that if you use them your skills actually decrease  Not only that but because the maximum level your characters can reach is  instead of  youre actually susceptible to the nervewracking Level  Death spell

Secondly the cast is shallow and characterless  The main character is grumpy and unsociable and this reviewer could not relate to him as a player should be able to  Also none of the other cast are very memorable like the characters of the other Final Fantasy games

Lastly the story is about as intriguing and deep as a pile of well you get the idea  The story begins all right but then lapses into a nauseating mismatched soap opera between the main character and his rivals ex  Not only that but the main characters attitude prevents the gamer from learning what the villain is really after they never give you a deep enough look at her

So really if youre a Final Fantasy fan skip this one  You didnt miss anythingThe way the lightmagnifier is mounted on the gameboy places the lens too far away and thus you have to be looking straight at the gameboy it cant be tilted left or right Also the lights do brighten the screen but again unless your looking straight on the lights will leave hot spots on your screen Hot spots is when light reflects off the screen and makes it difficult to see This product eats batteries and makes gaming harder Not a good purchaseI hadnt played an FF game for a long time so I picked up FFX hoping that all the good pub this game got would be true  Alas it was not  FFX was a wretched game no doubt  Disgusted after spending  hours I went back into the series having heard that the earlier games were better  My best buy had FFVIII on sale for like  so I bought it figuring it couldnt be worse than X  I was wrong  Where to begin  Ill start with the music which is really repetitive  Its really not even that good  Next the storyline which is SO bizzare  So Edea is the enemy  No shes being possessed by some other person  Who youve never heard mentioned  Not once until the rd disc  WTF  The drawjunction system is horrendous as well  Why cant I use the MP system  But my biggest complaint with this game is the GFs  At least by FFX they were smart enough to have the option to eliminate the intro scene  NO such option here  And I looked HARD  Each one requires a year and a day to summon so you just sit and watch Leviathan materialize create a slide and drop water down it  How impressive  If each character is summoning a GF you could get up drive  hours away to pick up some shoes on the side of the road come back home make dinner eat go to the bathroom and sit back down and Pandemona would still be firing its attack  And you cant avoid this because your characters are so weak physically that you must use them at least twice a battle  In the event you find enough items to improve your weapon this amount decreases but you still use nothing but GFs during boss fights  You dont even use real magic  Why  because using magic takes away defense points from your junction system  You may use heal and status magics but blacks are out of the question  Besides theyre weaker than the GFs  Even when triple cast a triple cast blizzaga is weaker than Shiva  Who thought of this  Im about  way through the rd disc and I really dont even want to finish it  When I found out the same people who designed this game designed X it came to me as no surprise  So many bad things about this game were evident in X it was eerie  Shame on square for allowing the makers of this game to make XBefore buying this game I strongly recommend downloading the demo off their website first  As a fan of many of the God Games out there I found this one very unintuitive  In short all of the people are  stupid and the game itself does some very dumb things
For instance  there are points in the demo where the farmworkers just sit there and drown  as the Nile River rises  The question isnt whats causing this  person to just sit there the question is why is this even  occurring
Thats just one example there are many many more  Another example  Ok I got to a point in the game where half of the  population would just leave  Then six months later theyd all return  again just to repeat the same process again and again year after year  Does this make any sense
I found all the micromanagement to be very  tiring  The object of the game isnt to build an empire its to figure  out all the stupid little workarounds it takes to make these people do what  they should be doing without any thought
This is just the demo folks  I strongly suggest you see for yourself before you drop your cash on the  real deal
DerekThe Game is sow Boring the story is not good at all final  is so much beter get that It sure does Old boring hard to play and hard to control This game is more fun than a sharp stick to the eye but not by much And the price when it first came out Sheesh Im betting that the only reason some people buy this is Laras chest and that doesnt justify purchasing this accident of a gameGood gravy This is the absolute worst game that I have ever played in my entire life Not that the game was even that bad but It never lived up to its own hype I have played all of the Final Fantasy games Since I beat the very first game I have been a loyal follower and a ruthless critic I cherished IV and I absolutely LOVE VI which is indeed the very best one in the entire series in terms of story and music And Final Fantasy VII blew my mind The Final Fantasy In a whole different perspective with three dimensions on the battlefield When FFVIII came out I already had a copy reserved I held the glowing package in my hands looked at the back of the cover and drooled over the beautiful graphics and in my head I could imagine the enchanting score that my ears would soon be treated to But as my best friend and I put the disk in and beheld Final Fantasy VIII There was a voice screaming in my head My mind kept saying something to me over and over again as I walked through Balamb Garden And then my friend said that very thought Jay this game sucks Yes it does This game is a disgrace to the series A storyline that is so slow so pointless that you actually look forward to the battle sequences There was no Final Fantasy VIII Theme The battle theme and the boss theme pale in comparison to the vicious relentless music of the FFVII Score There was not one piece of music that ever persuaded me to continue the journey The disgustingly weak plot was made tolerable only by the CG movies The character development was never there Never did we ever find out why Seifer was such a jerk Or WHY the GFs Ha ha erased the memories of the characters The lead character Squall answered every single question with the word whatever Compare that to the strongwilled heartbroken Cloud from FFVII and it becomes obvious Allow me to say one more thing Final Fantasy VI gripped me I captivated me with a spell that bound me I played played and played that silly game with its cute  bit graphics as if I were possessed The same goes for VII I wanted to know what was going to happen next at that moment I got as far as the mission to Timber in FFVIII and never gave it a second glance Only a year later after exams were done in college with no car or friends around Did I pull Final Fantasy VIII out again to give it a second chance How sad The only time I ever cried over a video game was when Aeris died in Clouds arms But when I first played Final Fantasy VIII I know that I wanted to just bawlCould have been a lot better to put it simply to perhaps the biggest final fantasy fan everme i was totally diappointed by this game i hate the whole modernfuturistic look that this game has even ff had this to a point i want this to be like fantasycastles swords mages kings knights wizards i hate that there is no armor or accessories plus i hate that there are no magic points and magic is not earned the experience points thing stinks leveling upmoney mean nothin in this game  my favorite part of RPG is building up wrecking machine armies  ergo my sabin celes edgar and terra army from ff  in this game the enemies level up with you so theres no point in leveling yourself up  this game is soooo dumbed down  the villain or lack thereof is horrible  BRING BACK KEFKA  the gfs take like  years to finish making battles so annoying instead of fun like in ff and chrono cross  the storyline is terrible and the characters are too real looking  plus every character is essentially the same each character does not have unique abilities except for the limit breaks maybe if square had released this game under a different title not final fantasy  i woulnt have been disappointed this remains the only ff game ever that i havent finished i stopped playing on disc  if u want a good RPG to play get FF which goes back to hardcore fantasy and the original ways that made final fantasy so great also i recommend ff which is undoubtable the best FF game ever and arguably the best game ever i also recommened chrono trigger and chrono cross which are totally awesome games  dont waste your time or money with final fantasy What a poor excuse for a Final Fantasy game this game should have never came to america Sure the graphics are great but the characters make me sick and the plot seems like it came right from a Baby Sitters Club Book The main character Squall is suffereing from teenaged agnst please Oh and the magic system the draw and juctioning system great idea ahahahahahahaha If you want a GOOD Final Fantasy get  and  or    and  for those people who think that they know Japanese Just stay as far away from this game as you possibly canok I admit if I known how bad this game was I still would have bought the game but I wish I would had waited until the game went down to  before I wasted almost  for it I hope Square makes FF better before they waste millions of dollars on another crap  shoot
Now for my reasons for the  star
 It was a rip off of FF if you want to get FF  but havent played FF get FF
 Why no voice acting  I sooooooo recomend it  Cmon Square at least on the CG moviespease let FF have voice acting
 The characters in the game not just the playable  ones but all of them seem to have no life to them its just boring how the characters are so dull I just cant  explain it
 Rushed rushed rushed and rushed Cmon  Square where is this quality gaming I remember from your other stuff like Chrono Trigger and old classics like that
 I dont have anough time to tell you the rest but there  is alot of other stuffwow i bought this game hoping that blizzard had stopped going half way on their games which is clearly evident in games like starcraft warcraft diablowell i bought this game and it was stupid this is what i affectionately call a clicker game you know i left click on youi hit you i right clic on you i do a magic thing boring they try to make it interesting with the whole unique character thing but the fact that itll always be the same thing every time you play it doesnt really give you much replay value also a killer is the mandatory questsyou must complete every quest in order to move on in the already dull plot if you really want a real RPG buy Baldurs Gate its cheaper and you get to completely make your character and theres a totally nonlinear plot do waht you want or dont but be prepared to suffer the consequences Baldurs Gate puts YOU the gamer in control while diablo  you are just kinda along for the ride diablo  is deffinitely a game for those simpleminded gamers who dont really like the whole variable plot thingthe ones that dont like having a choice where to go or what to do when they want to the ones who just want to click their way to victory this game gets one star which is many  many more than it deservesIf you like clicking banners and advertisements off your screen you will love this game cause thats all it is clicking annoying flyingpopping graphics off your screenIt IS point and click  Yeah the greatest RPG of all time  It certainly makes you gain weight faster than any other RPG  All my friends have been fattened and dumbed by this marvel in brainwashing  They are all now one with the chair that they sit in  Greatest RPG  Not even close  Those who say it is are probably physically dependant upon it by now  I observe people play with their eyes two inches from the monitor and their mouths slack with saliva dripping from the corners of their mouths  The only thing that moves is the hand making quick convulsive movements  I say that even if it does expand your brain Ha ha the other negative effects far outweigh the goodPoint click point click point click  Need I say more  Incase you missed that it was point click repeat  THIS GAME SUCKS  I doubt the expansion will be any better  I guess if you are twelve and you get your rocks off by having super items and being able to kill anyone in the game then its sorta fun but wheres the challenge  It took me ten minutes to master this game  I cannot say enough bad things about this waste of moneyThis game is Civ II meets DD Its horrible One of my five LEAST favorite gamesIts unfortunate that you have to buy these cards second hand now Sony will do anything to make you buy newer versions of their PSthat have had constant complaints from customers There are a lot of Very Good PS  GAMES OUT THEREAND YOU CANT PLAY THEM WITHOUT THE MEMORY CARDwEITE TO sony AND COMPLAINMy best advise is to never buy a memory card online I couldnt save at all with out it needing to be reformatted each time I suggest not to buy memory cards onlineNow let me tell you straight that Rayman is one of the best games I have  ever played  With wonderous worlds challenging levels and memorable  charicters make it a game to be hold  That where Rayman  comes in  Gone  are all the great stuff I mentioned above clearly a fatele mistake on Ubi  Softs part  We have none of the returning cast Except for Rayman of  course choppy D graphics A lot of the graphics look like they were  painted on the game and very little challenge makes this a tradgity  Ive had this game for little over three days and have unlocked all the  secrets AND beat the game  The first had me playing for months  And  when I was finished with it I shed a tear of joy and said Now THAT  was a game  Im still wondering how this can be called a sequal  its terrible  Im truly offended by this game  All those who praise this  game have probibly never played the first game  I beg of all those who  read this reveiw please play the first game first to see what Rayman truly  has to offer you  This game is just a wasted game  I hope Ubi Soft wises  up with Rayman  or Ill just have to shelf the game as A game that  got killed when turned to D  Boo hooAs a Myst fan I looked forward to this game and was sure that since it was so difficult to find in my local store that it must have been great Boy was I wrong I played through and found that the puzzles were pretty difficult simply because were totally unrelated to each other and the rest of the game in general Running a PII  MHz machine the game gave me no problems and the graphics ran fine I am not an extremely picky gamer and with a bit of a plot this game could have been tolerable  Totally hate this game  Maybe its because Im over  and have very little patience for action platformer video games these days  I dont know but this game is exceptionally frustrating to say the very least  And I grew up on the old Nintendo Super Mario platforming days  This game is nothing like that  Its extremely difficult to the point where it does nothing to help my temper issues  If you want to seriously throw your controller down the block then get this game  Otherwise please do yourselves a favor and pass it up  You dont need the aggravation in your lifeTHE X BUTTON DID NOT WORK

I believe i received the controller  that you returnedThanks to Nintendos bright idea to make a system and double the graphics from the bit Sega Saturn and Playstation systems we get stuck with one of the worst sytems out there  True Sega Saturn had lousy D graphics and  bad thirdparty support no one can deniy the fact it had some great games  on it  And I hate Playstation but because they shaped their graphics just  right the games somehow came out looking better than N  Not only do we  get a really cheesy system they also had to turn many classic D games and  turn them into horrible D games Like Earthworm Jim D Zelda Donkey Kong   Kirby Rayman  and so much more  Plus the controll drove me  bonkers the way they controll it  Sometimes the controlls bother me so  much I have to stop playing the game  Plus because the games are in  cartriges Lousy sound and space because of this they cost a lot  and the games are usally short and dont last more than a couple of hours  before youre finished with the game  And this is from someone who has  loved all their other systems they made  Which is why I was crying after I  played this thing I still think once was too painfull at a friends house  Complete waste of money  I do not recomend  Lets hope the Nintendo Cube  Box turns out better than this piece of trashThis is argubaly the worst system EVER The music is horrible sounding comparing to the beauty of the playstation There are no good RPG games for  this system The graphics in most games are nowhere near they could be and  overall a pathetic system The best game it had was Goldeneye  and in my  mind that is the ONLY good game besides Perfect Dark to appear on the  entire system during its  years on the American MarketThis is not a game It is manure masquerading as a game Smelly manure  Im all for a sense of wonder but when that sense of wonder is bogged down by an insurmountable wall of bugs bad bugs an extremely clunky physics engine nonexistent gameplay and a bunch of other gaffes who needs it  This is an excellent boxstacking simulation but is nothing elseTrust me Do not buy this game  I am the local TM lover and knowall  I bought TM TM and TM sadly I cant find a copy of TM  After i bought TM I was looking forward to cool characters cool battlegrounds and semipixated graphics  I found none of these things  There are only  new characters Club Kid Auger Flamethrower and my favorite new driver Flower Power  The levels especially Washington DC is a small open level which is no fun  The North Pole is annoying and I hate the boring London level  The graphics are cheesy and  studios tried to make them look too real  The cars flip over with every tight turn you make when another car hits you or you drive onto a hill  This game is not realistic  This game should have  stars and is a disgrace to the TM title  I warn you do not even look at this game  It is the worst  The car combat genre is in shameTwisted Metal  is overrated  because its not normally considered the worst Playstation game  I cant believe how unfun this game is  The  control is laughable  The gameplay is incredibly boring  The music is Rob  Zombie which is bad enough before you hear it  times in a row  The  game also adds almost nothing new  Dont even rent this oneAs Im unable to fully review this game let me just say the game is not compatible with WIN XP  If you are lucky or foolish enough to still be running Win  then you may be able to get the game to loadgame is crappy and unfair enemys cheat and respawn making it impossible to compleate missions you either defend your man all the time or diehorrible system Graphics suck Get an xbone COD is way better than these crap games Xbone and ps are a go DONOT BUYYYYPlease hear me out Let me try to explain why I gave this system such a low rating

Had this console not been remembered as being fantastic and interesting I would be giving it  stars But unfortunately there really isnt anything very interesting about this console The graphics arent very good compared to the PSX or even some of the better stuff on the Saturn like Panzer Dragoon Saga or Virtua Fighter  the Shenmue Saturn demo Sega Rally and Daytona Championship Circuit Edition to name a few Lots of games Ive played have very low resolution textures often sprawled out The games themselves just arent very interesting or fun to play even in multiplayer

Im also not a huge fan of the controller While it has an odd design it is fairly comfortable and the joystick is very precise

Finally theres the value The games themselves are not at all worth the high prices they demand Super Smash Brothers simply isnt as fun as Powerstone or Bushido Blade Mario Kart  isnt as much fan as Ridge Racer Type  or Crash Team Racing Mario Golf is nowhere near as good as Neo Turf Masters Hell even Mario isnt as fun as the Crash Bandicoot games And just about all of the games listed with the exception of Powerstone  or  are all marginally cheaper than their N competitors

For the final verdict this is a system I would recommend avoiding The prices are far too high for their own good and the games arent good enough to justify the prices If it hadnt been for the huge disappointment all the games I had brought me this would have a higher rating

Take off the rose tinted glasses peopleI own this game  I have gotten a  star rating once but it is dumb because if you run out of money and go into debt you cant get your money back or build anything  The people get impatient and stressed out and then they start taking your money away  I would recommend that you buy Spider Man or the Spider Man Movie Game instead of this annoying game that never endsIt is really a shame that this game was never updated for windows XP You can run most of the features but the practice shooting range no longer works and this is an important feature You need to practice to do well in solving the puzzles I wrote to them a while back but they showed no interest in providing a fix I guess they made their money and dont careThis seller named woodhec sent me a DEFECTIVE N Console and I was very disappointed for Christmas Dont ever buy from this seller unless you want to get robbed of your money This deserves a FLAT this game is the hardest game ive ever played and that takes away the fun also graphics very poor even for nintendo  cannot even recommend for people i dislike dont waste your time or money worst n game everIm giving  star because this is one of the cheapest packages I have ever bought it looks like a pirated copy No wait a pirated copy would look better
All the disks came in a single case onve over the other which caused scratches in almost all of them
Oh and all the cool covers on the disks horrible black and white labels
I regret buying thisthis is the stuppidiest game ive ever played I advise everyone not to play it or buy it It really suckedDoesnt work I was told it was in working order and just needed cables now I am being told I need to purcdhase more for it to make it actually work which I dont believe I had  of these systems for  yrs and had no problemsNES is the best ever SNES was great but N for me had no games that were nearly as memorible  I enjoyed Doom  WCWNWO games MK Trilogy Goldeneye Banjo Kazooie and thats about it but again nothing really memorible  The grapics were new at the time but look like total garbage now and I have no desire to play the N but I still play NES to this dayI like adventure games but I like them to follow some sort of logical  puzzle solving so dyou can kind of get inside the mind of the creators  figure out how they think and figure the game out that way These puzzles  are completely illogical obviously designed to be frustrating and keep  you trying different senseless things to proceed in the game  Also  although the D backgrounds were interesting at times calling this a d  game is quite a stretch by any definition Even the d cutscenes were  crappy and the graphics during regular gameplay were just terrible  Supposedly the game made game of the year in Europe they must  be pretty hard up over there now I know not to take that as a  commendationThis game is very fun to play but be warned off by this review from me  It has the highly severe computer worm in its installation cds that Symantecs Norton web site refers to as IRC W Tibick Activity  Also the XP update for it also has a computer worm in it
To check out the details off what it does to infected computer systems go to 
That page at Norton doesnt specifically refer to Final Fantasy VII but for those that want to know for sure that what Im stating is correct you can use the shorter web site address at Norton by using the web address of 
In the web page that pops up into view enter Final Fantasy VII  into the search box on that page and hit the enter key on your keyboard  A page with three options will comeup  The top one is about the worm in the FF VII installation cds  The next one is about the XP  version upgrade and that has an additional worm in it  The final option refers to a worm that infects FF XI  FF XII  That worm is even more dangerous than even the one on the FF VII installation cds  Thast one will automatically go to the computers  email section and send ZIP versions of itself to every contact listed there  Also all three worms will every time the computer is turned on check for a specific website to get upgraded versions of itself
My advise though Norton doesnt state it is to destroy every copy of the PC version of Final Fantasy VII that you have to prevent infecting the computers in the world
In the file about IRC W Tibick Activity the Norton people mention how to completely remove the computer worm from infected computer systems  That process can take a while though as that worm infects several other programs on the computer as well  Norton lists all the programs that it infects as well
I myself have two copies of FF VII and even a copy of the cds I made as well  Im going to destroy those cds as well to follow my own advise  Those people sure did a very mean stunt to the makers of Final Fantasy VII in ruining possibly the best rpg game they ever made  Personally I think those people at the least should be sent to a federal prisionsp for the rest of their lives grrrI bought this game at a fairly low price and when I started playing I was totally amazed  at the incredibly bad graphics

 The game featured a basic HUD with two annoyingly large bars placed above and below it That was the first thing I noticed Next I saw that the terrain was sort of fuzzy and my gun wasnt all that impressive either

 OK I said to myself Why dont I try walking around and see if this gets any better So I did Guess what No gun sway Every stinkin FPS game Ive every seen had some sort of movement with the gun Ok maybe not Wolfenstein d but still

 So anyway I tried firing the gun  barely any recoil at all I tried a pistol just to see if the hammer would pull back but it did not

 Anywayz terrible graphics  boring game Enough saidGet it through your head THIS GAME stinks First of all the graphics suckboring gameplayI usually like realistic military games coudnt acess campaign takes forever to install I would give this game  stars I just bought it about  hour ago played it for  min and then got bored Try the Unreal series  half life or rainbow As with the Final Fantasy Origins disc for sale through Amazon this is a bootleg disc It contains silver backed discs versus trademark original black PlayStation discs I should have known better for the price and condition These are considered some of the greatest Final Fantasy titles for crying out loud

Everything still works The case is complete with bootlegged manual and the games play fine in my OG PSX console but I didnt want no dirty illegal software when I paid for this so it gets one star  Do yourself a favor and get a good used copy but be careful these pirated copies have proliferated Amazons used store and eBay

Look for the Squaresoft logo and black discs

Amazon you need to pull these from your storefrontOkay here it is in a nutshell  The graphics bite and bite HARD  The spell component system is so difficult that playing hack and slash by default is much more preferable  And there is little if any help by the  GMs  My two cents  Buy at your own riskThis game should have NEVER been released in its current state Its load times are unacceptable Both games feel like chores playing because of how long everything takes due to very poor emulation Squaresoft wanted to make as much money as they could with the game without having to spend any money to hire someone who could make the game work properly with the PS This is an extremely bad port of FF and FF FF freezes very often when you try to save Also its load times are long Not to mention this is the original translation of the game so be prepared to have a certain character talk like a drunken brain damaged pirate the entire game FF just butchers the English language FF is the same as it was on SNES except for extremely long load times It becomes a chore trying to open the menu to heal your character or whatever The long load times really take away from the games and just makes the whole thing a bad experience Stick to the SNES or get these games on gameboy advance Also FF is exactly the same on PSN as it was in anthology LONG LONG load times as well as being incompatible with your PS half the time Shame on you square soft shameNot even owning a Game Shark can make this game fun Without it you have to drop an elbow on your opponent  times to get the pin With a Game Shark a mere  times All jokes aside gameplay is extremely slow and irritating In the time it takes to execute one complicated move I could have made a hero sandwich grabbed another drink and went to the mens room Controller response is so slow it feels as if someone spilled a soda on your controller last week I like what one reviewer said about the punches taking  hours to deliver I couldnt stop laughing when I read that By the way I sold my WCW Mayhem game at my last yard sale for  And that people IS TRUEBelieve me I would give this game zero stars if Amazoncom allowed me
I received this for Christmas as a gift and let me tell you  This is possibly the worst piece of garbage put on the market  I mean the questions run out fast leaving the game to replay old questions which are easy once you get to know them which means the replay value isnt very high  If you want a fun game try the Sims or Delta Force Landwarrior  Your time would be better spent with those games Would have a good review if the developers spent more than five minutes slapping this together  By the second or third time through the questions were already repeating themselves  awful  Plus multiplayer is just a fastestfinger question to determine who plays solo  Big deal
The worst part is the game only runs about two or three times before it crashes on startup  This is on an Intel PC with namebrand components no cheap swapmeet stuff  The only solution has been to uninstall and reinstall the game  A visit to the Disney Interactive site for tech support umm where is it  Because of this I cant recommend anyone purchase this game
Theyve come out with a second edition of this game wow so quick  Perhaps this version worksMan I never knew Phil Regis could be this ANNOYING  Since some of the first few questions are ludicrously hard which is totally unlike the show and it gives you  seconds to answer the question which is ALSO  totally unlike the show I have to restart the game A LOT which means I  hear Phil Regis A LOT  A skip button shouldve been put into  the game  I havent recieved any repeat questions after about  months of  owning the game  How  I uninstalled it after  minutes and never played  it again  Trust me youd get more fun out of an electronic whoopee  cushion than this gameand its  cheaperThis is the most meager cashin attempt Ive ever seen There may well be hundreds of questions but itll take you a thousand games to see them all I was receiving a couple or three repeat questions by the fifth game and a  majority of repeats by game  There seems to be little or no gradual  increase in difficulty which was proven when I saw a  question later  repeated as a  question later in the game
An example of the  games inadequacy runs thusly I am cruising through the game easily until  the  Fine by now Im expecting them to be tough I use the   then the call a friend who says she is  certain the answer is A Just  to be sure I use the audience poll as well Guess what  say that A  is their choice Well now Im convinced and go with A as well Im  WRONG its B That is just stupid beyond measure If they wanted to  throw me off make the audience rating more like  or  something
Nice graphics nice sounds atrocious game mechanics Wait for  the improved version or play it on the netI have to admit that I never was a victim of the Tomb Raider Hype Machine I liked the idea of a rd person perspective game where your character can do alot of tricks but the whole idea of the bigboobed Lara Croft just turned me off  I bought this for  bucks at the used software house and played it for about  hours I liked the save game feature somewhat it should be more specific I felt like banging my head against a wall after be killed for the th time because I didnt hit the jump button in the right sequence with the run button at the correct prescribed time  The interface is just too rigid for a game like this it reminded me alot of that old Dragons Lair game And I got real tired of the stupid puzzles  I think the real reason for TR being so popular is that its the first nonadult game with a overlyendowed female protagonist It cant be because of the gameplayI could not play it as it did not want to be downloaded on either a  windows or an ME windows so beware as you could be out of pocket money and not be able to use it  the saving grace I didnt pay much for itWow I expected something decent when I bought this at my local HalfPrice Books store I was on a Mortal Kombat Craze hell I even bought MKAnnihilation at the same place on dvd BUT THIS IS GOD AWFUL

The Presentation is terrible You only have a Choice of  characters Scorpion Kano Liu Kang Raiden SubZero Sonya No Johnny Cage The Game itself is just a  fighter tournament About  fights of the same thing then last  is Endurance rounds aka tag team fighters Then Goro fight where Goro just gropes you then Shang Tsung fight THE END

Back  sec pause Back  sec pause B  Dont try and speedrun this game

The music is just an abomination take a listen



Overall dont waste any money on this If you decide to buy this pick up some peptobismo on your way back to the grocery store Or just get an SNES or Arcade emulator if you want to play the real MKThe game boy port of Mortal Kombat was just awful The music and graphics were decentbut the gameplay was super slowthere was absolutley NO blood OR sweat like in the SNES versionand the fatalities were just dumb Another bad thingfor ME anywaywas there is no Johnny Cage in this versionwho was one of my favorite characters from the first game The only good MK game for game boy was MK IIJust pass this one up It sucksEternal Champions is an awesome gamefor Sega CDThis version of it for Genesis is total crap First of allthe game is almost IMPOSSIBLE to beat Youll have one hell of a time just getting past the first fight What makes it even worse is there is no way to adjust the difficulty level on this game neither Another bad thing about this stinker is when you lose a matchyou gotta keep hitting reset over and over again if you wanna change your fighter This game sucks There IS some history behind this game though This was the very first exclusive fighting game that went straight to Genesisand that wasnt in the arcade first But that little history lesson doesnt save this terrible game Oh and did I mention that you need a six button controller to play this game tooYou can play it with a three button padif you like to keep hitting the start button over and over again to change your punches into kicks My best advice to you is to stay as far away from this game as you canand pick up the Sega CD version of itThis game is the worst fighting game ever You have to press start to change from punch to kick the players are original but just damn dumb and the game is hard You will be lucky enough to even pass the first person The graphics are ok but its horrendous mechanics destroys any hope for this game and you cant even change your character if you loose so that forces you to hit the reset button every time you want to change charactersThis game seems like it was thrown together to keep as much speed as possible Back in the early s Genesis was the blistering fast system As per the SEGA gargon Truth is it was slghtly faster then SNES but couldnt handle the colors So now was know why they left over half the colors of the orginial Now we are stock with this thing They kept most of the moves and all the colors but doesnt have any intro or ending animation which means it looks half done Before you defend this game think of this Super Street Fighter looked great but they they just didnt take the time porting this game And much like Mortal Kombat it looks drab choppy and well peiced together

 On the other hand if you are a collector and you want a PR port check out X It is one of the best ports out there This is one of the most ported games of all time and the Genesis is one of the ones to try to see how much they took out and how bad it wasLooks and plays nothing like PC or arcade version and the moves are too complicated  Get MK instead TerribleTHIS IS THE VERSION OF MORTAL KOMBAT  THAT YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY AVOID THIS GAME WAS HORRIBLE AND IT MAKES THE SUPER NINTENDO VERSION LOOK LIKE A GOOD GAME IN COMPARISON THE GRAPHICS ARE AWFUL THE MUSIC IS ANNOYING HERE THE CONTROLS ARE BAD AND UNLESS YOU HAVE A  BUTTON CONTROLLER FOR THE SEGA GENESIS YOU CANT DO MUCH OF ANYTHING THIS IS A MAJOR DISSAPOINTMENT TO THOSE THAT HAVE THIS GAME ON GENESIS AVOID THIS VERSION AT ALL COSTS THIS IS A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME THIS VERSION JUST RUINS THIS SOMEWHAT DECENT SEQUELThis is just too bad For such a cool character Batman has had some bad luck with video games This is probably the worst and thats saying a lot  This game is no fun did you see the one star and is not worth anyones timewhen i was a kid i thought this was fun but i played it lately this is so boring and dullthe games okay although i dont think making the charactersin d was a very good idea plus at some points game gets outrightboringand all the main characters smoke  although the game will crash sometimes and it might get stuck overall the game is pretty much okay if you dont count crashes and how the characters act and look  ENDAnother lousey boring basketball game where do they come up with these games this game was stupidmischief makerswhat does make you think ofteenagers who get bored and break stufffirecrackerspractical jokesprankshow aboutnone of the abovehow about some crap that looks like it belongs on the original atarino mischiefjust a very poorly animated and quite bright super mario bros rip offsave your money a buy a box a paper clipsyoull have more funThis is exactly what everybody has said already about this game Its bad REALLY BAD The intro movie alone is enough to let you know what youre in for which is a whole lot of crap

The game only features geometrical shapes and solid colors for graphics Seriously it really does look like if you tried to make a D world out of construction paper The controls are waaaaaay off as in if you start running its near impossible to turnstopmaneuver your character and jumping on enemies consists of landing directly under your shadow or you will get hit and die Gliding is a smaller jump that makes you float a little its completely USELESS unless you need to use it on those floorfanenemies to float up And the sounds ugggghhhh oh my atrocious

But heres the thing about this torture devise its entertaining to a certain degree Now I may be crazy but I bought this just to say I own one of the worst games in history but Im actually compelled to beat it to  A challenge that may result in brain damage but Im no quitter If you plan on getting this for the lolz get some beer and call a couple of friends over This is the videogame equivalent of an Asylum movieMy older brother and I enjoyed the Bubsy series for Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo growing up  Now that those systems were no longer creating any new titles in favor of the Nintendo  and Playstation it was time to move on to the  bit world  When Bubsy D was launched in  we were so excited to try it out but little do we know that we were being  tricked  It was a pixelated D mess  My brother got it for his th birthday and it was probaly the worst gift he receieved in time  After trying to figure out this crappy game by enduring the confusing camera rotations boring music crappy navigation and Bubsys annoying random comments throughout the game we just went back to playing the original Bubsy on Sega Genesis  I may have been the worst friend in the world because I gave Bubsy D to my best friend in exchange for Marvel Super Heroes game for Playstation  This game tarnished the reputation of the lovable sarcastic Bobcat  Just stay away from this piece of s and go back to your Super NES and Sega titles because they were untouched timeless classics and a whole lot more fun than this D garbageWell here it is guys the WORST Mortal Kombat game of alltime  Yup the honor goes to the Game Boy version of Mortal Kombat II

I bought this game when it first came out because I was stupidly riding on the success of the Mortal Kombat series at the time  I was very naive all my friends were right

Time hasnt been kind to this game but who am I kidding  Time wasnt kind to this game the day it came out because it was an absolute piece of plastic trash then and its trash now  It will forever remain trash  Its so trashy the trashman wont even take it  He says it stinks too much and its not worth the risk of potentially sniffing the horrible odor just to put the game in the back of his truck  Even if he were to wear the thickest pair of gloves in the world he doesnt want to risk the smell remaining on his skin permanently

So why am I bashing the game so hard  Because you get fewer fighters fewer levels HORRIBLE black and white graphics and the worst part an extremely slow framerate  The blood doesnt even exist  Okay theres blood but watching it on a hardtosee black and white screen would you even call that blood  No you wouldnt and shouldnt

I would rather have a job being a janitor in an elementary school and having to clean up barf on the cafeteria floors every day than play the Game Boy version of Mortal Kombat II ever again  Its really that bad  At least then you can swirl the puke around with a mop and have some fun

For the love of God and all his wonderful adorable Earthly creatures DO NOT BUY THIS GAME  Just when I thought the Mortal Kombat series couldnt get any crappier it happenedI heard this game is crap I have it for NES and its cool But this is weird Why would they make a stupid easy game for GBA Why wont they let you play as the cool people like Baraka You stubborn retards can make a better choice of system and game then thisI bought this game way back when the N was in its heyday I thought it wasnt very good and traded it in Now I see somebody is trying to sell it for  If anybody is considering buying Quest  at this ridiculous price I urge them to think twice There are plenty of far far better games for your money I know there werent that many RPGs for the N but that doesnt make this game a classic IMHO Youd be better off looking for some of the excellent SNES RPGs like FF II and III or Legend of Zelda A Link to the PastWargods is a much better game made by the same people for the N This game is somewhat glitchy and straining Save your money Buy a better Mortal Kombat game for a newer system Not worth havingblends  mortal kombats in one not the first three games that i expected game play was lame Not for beginners very hardIt didnt not work i had to send it back

Ive ordered another one I hope this one workswhat a joke this game is worthless I wouldnt have taken this game if it had been for free let alone  dollarsThis is not what youd expect from Rare or from the Donkey Kong series The game has a really basic plot The bad croc is going to blow up Donkey  Kongs island Everyone including me was expecting super graphics from  the expansion pack which you need to play this game Not true The  graphics are a bit better then the average game but not as good as they  could be The game is remarkably similar to BanjoKazoie another  star  game in that you learn moves as you progress through the game something I  HATE The characters also speak in mumbles that get annoying However  probably the worst part is that the game play is boring and it is hardly  challenging I beat the first level fully and almost beat the nd through  th levels in the first week I had it and I havent touched it since The  only good part is the multiplayer mode So if youre going to buy an N  game look elsewherethe graphics is pretty good on this game but the game play sucks its not worth your moneyThis game is so stupid i dont understand why people like it There is no real fun in it For one thing you cant jump wich is dumb and the attack moves are really duel it sucks do not buy this game

If by any chance you liked this game then check out all of the other Bomberman gamesNot as advertised My wife was scammed the same way when she bought me  controllers as a gift THEY ARE NOT NINTENDO CONTROLLERS It doesnt match up to the yellow  green N official controllers I have They have a grey connector not the blue as in the picture meaning its a knockoff I am not bothered about buying knockoffs but do not assume this is a nintendo controller Will work fine sometimes and not others
Simply not good enoughIf I could give no stars I would Controller shipped quickly but was not as it was described in the listing Quality was rated as acceptable with a loose joystick When we opened the box the controller had two cuts with somewhat exposed wires in the main cord dirt in the joystick and memory card areas and other spots that could have easily been cleaned in less then  minute When we plugged the controller in the loose joystick greatly effected game play We sent the controller back within a few daysI borrowed this game from a friend I played for half an hour then got bored Im glad I didnt pay money for it Its pretty much just BanjoKazooiewhich I also didnt like I was upset especially when I got to the first door requiring gold bananas Why couldnt they have just put out another BanjoKazooie game and make an ORIGINAL Donkey Kong game for the N

BanjoKazooie was fun until the difficulty spiked out of nowhere Also the idea of making a cartoonish adventure somewhat nonlinear is poorly executed in it

I didnt play far enough to see if Donkey Kong corrected any of this but it looks like it didnt It just changed the setting from running around inside of a mountain to running around inside of islands Great

If you liked BanjoKazooie Im sure youll love this If not definitely skip Donkey Kongdonkey kong is a stupid game the charaters are monkeys for the love of God monkeysthis game does not have a story line do not try this gameI wish they would make a Gamecube sidescrolling Donkey Kong effort like the SNES games just make the graphics better retain the music quality and make more levels and longer They included some lovely old games like the original DONKEY KONG arcade game and a spaceman game for computer There are big worlds but that seems just about it Theres a lot of collecting but the problemsolving is no fun This series became really removed from its huge SNES appealI bought DK when it first came out in  and from the moment I started to play it I did not like it at all It is way too complicated and difficult to play and I would not recommend this game Every time I tried to play it I just kept getting frustrated and I had to stop playing it Instead I would recommend BanjoKazooie or Mario Simply confusing and I dont see how any non year old kid in the s could like thisI remember burrowing this from a friend because I ran out of N games to play so I burrowed this and some other games for a few days I have to say it was fun at first than it became frustrating and than I felt like I was going to throw up because of the weird controls and this and that moving around in weird places which I didnt intended in doing It was also because I was really young then and I really didnt know what the game was really about which is puzzle solving sometimes

I advise not buying the game instead tell your friend to buy it because its the best game ever and take it from him when he wants to throw it out Of course youll lose a friend but well worth it Game  Friendship Im just playing kidsI was looking for ace combat
not air combat It popped up and I did not bother to read the few letter difference
I also sent it backIm an avid gamer but Anno  is an INSULT to gaming  It is so buggy and halffinished that the first campaign doesnt even work properly and the DRM is INCREDIBLY frustrating to deal with

Once you manage to work your way past the massive amounts of bugs and get through the DRM HOURS later you finally figure out that the game has no real tutorial so you stuck just clicking around randomly

Sad sad sad example of a game that could have been great but FTWShaq Fu is a game that should never have been created Horrible D fighter and miserable plot Great for a gag gift for a classic gamerThere are evil forces in America that will try to sell you anything and these evil forces understand the publics fascination with sports heroes and celebrities and so take a sports hero and a video game and shouldnt that be a winning combination Listen this game is simply retarded A basketball player does not a martial artist make At first glance you might think this game is pretty cool after all the graphics are very well done and the animation is very fluid But when you realize that you have a total of three movespunch kick jumpand that you can defeat any evil kung fu master just by endlessly jump kicking across the screen and bouncing like a pogo stick you realize this is not going to be a very deep fighting game But yeah the graphics are pretty good so this game doesnt suck as bad as it possibly could And then you remember that its about a basketball hero who just happens to be a worldclass martial artist and that that martial artist is none other than Shaquille ONeil And you realize that you have too much free time on your hands and that maybe youre playing this cart because youre really desperate to be entertained and then you realize you were having more fun with Bimini Run which you go back to OK to be fair this game isnt nearly as bad as Bimini Run but its still pretty ridiculous Recommended only for those who enjoy a nice steaming pile of crapThe game looks fine but it doesnt work I bought  games from this seller  of which did not workThis game is insainly hard

wow xxLara Croft games have NEVER been any good  I remember when the very first one came out  years ago  Teens were practically DROOLING on their controller every time they saw Laras pretty face  Tomb Raider must have been advertised like it was the most groundbreaking video game to ever hit the freakin market  The thing is the games are boring and Lara Croft isnt very pretty

If polygonbreasted girls are your thing go for it  But they arent MY thing and I know Im not the only one to think so  Lara Croft isnt goodlooking to the millions of internet gamers who understand that a blockylooking computer babe isnt going to automatically make a game any fun to play  Ill give Lara Croft SOME credit  She was one of the originators of the running around halfnaked female shooteradventure type of video games  In fact you might even say she was a MAJOR influence because soon after her very first adventure more and more game companies were making the main characters in their games halfnaked chicks  Lara brought something new to the world of video games and I will give her credit for that

Sometimes influence doesnt matter when a game is really bad  This is one of those cases  The Tomb Raider series on the original Playstation is a joke  I absolutely groan when I think about playing a Tomb Raider game because I remember how ugly and dark the environments are the glitchy problems that dominate all three Tomb Raider games the annoying and difficult jumping style of Lara Croft which makes it nearly impossible to progress to the end of the game  Good luck she NEVER jumps where you want her to and of course mentioned above Laras supposed beautiful face shes NOT pretty remember

It also doesnt help that the puzzles you have to solve are ALWAYS really awful and appear frequently and because of the jumping problem very frustrating to complete  Trying to aim your gun at an emeny isnt exactly a walk in the park either  The whole series has been an overrated disaster up to this point

By the time Tomb Raider  was released people were REALLY getting fed up with the series  Now these same people will tell you this was because they kept releasing more and more Tomb Raider games but I actually think people got sick of Tomb Raider because games like Resident Evil and Silent Hill came along with a similar style and improved on it drastically making Tomb Raider look awfully dated by comparison

At least the third Tomb Raider game has SOME decentlooking background levels  I guess the company who created Lara Croft finally understood that Laras pretty face ALONE isnt going to get the job done anymore  I mean at least in some places the backgrounds LOOK good   Not exactly the prettiest environments available on the Playstation of course and most of the time all you see is darkness or candlelight  But whats THERE is okay to look at at least

Tomb Raider  features a challenge that is mostly only challenging because of the abovementioned jumping problem  She simply doesnt jump the way you want her to  Youd THINK the game company wouldve dealt with this problem with all the new moves for Lara they added to the game but no none of these new moves make the game any easier  The artifactfinding storyline had potential but unfortunately the frustrating challenge ruined it

BOY am I glad I never bought any of these games all these years Ive been watching OTHER people play them  Reading reviews for the more recent Tomb Raider games on the Playstation  I see NO improvements have been made  Let the series END alreadyI remember renting for the weekend at our local video store ages ago It took about an hour to figure out how to make the grappler hit the sweet spot so I could get to the second floor That was only the first level In case youre wondering I had no problem getting past the first stage in other video games So it wasnt my lack of experience it was the abysmal game design The music or at least the music I heard as I stopped playing after the first level was mediocre If you really want to play a Batman Game for SNES I recommend Batman Returns and The Adventures of Batman and Robin Some bad games can still be fun but this one isntAs the other reviews have stated this is a very boring game You are Batman or Robin set out to save Gotham from the Riddler and Twoface An interesting thing to this game is that the buttons are set up like Mortal Kombat high punch low punch up to jump and select to use your grappling hook When you start each level you make a choice of two extra weapons like smoke bombs gas guns and baterangs Theres not much to the game you move straight through on a set side scrolling platform path beating up bad guys The graphics are pretty amazing being that the game is so much like Mortal Kombat so are the graphicsSo after the success of Batman Returns there would be a movie adaption of Batman Forever  The graphics looked interesting  Almost a next gen feel for the SNES  And it would be a brawler  So how could it go wrong  Well first off it feels like they are trying to rip off Mortal Kombat
But the worst sin is that the controls are horrendous  They are so frustrating  I remember spending most of my time mashing buttons just trying to get my grappling hook to work  Still brings up bad memories all these years later
The story is fine  And it is a good challenge in game play  But its never a good game where the main challenge is the broken controls  Game better left lost to the sands of timeAnother blast from my past  No matter how far I got I could never beat the game completely  So i figured id change that by pairing it up many years later with the game genie and play the game  Unfortunately my copy of the game is so distorted from use and abuse it cant be played  What little visual I have on screen is just a pixelated blob  Had the store I bought it from quality checked the item before they sold it online then this would be a better review  But since it cost less than a box of chicken nuggets I didnt bother and threw it awayIts never reissued it doesnt seem or else there would be cheaper used copies for common people out there why only the machines reissued but not the gamesthen everyone fights over few available copies urr disappointingonly ones out there are like  of some games that are classicslike was so hard to find a copy of  just Mario kart even I finally found a Japanese super famicon which I found out luckily worked on my retro duo super nesnes consolebut geez please reissue the classics to make them easier to find to buyThis game is ok but mostly mediocre This is the best that the N had to offer alongside the wrestling games and resident evil  Just goes to show that the nintendrone cult are way off the mark The Sony playstation  had better games and far better immersion due to having the CD storage  This game like i said is ok but hardly as good as the nintendrones have made it out to be The production of the game is basically weak with the menu intro being pathetic and the music repeating over and over and over on each board The gameplay is ok in that i can mow down enemies while running but the aiming sucks and it gets boring having to mow down enemies that keep spawning over and over while i figure out how to complete the mission
Finally the multiplayer is wayyyyyy overrated I remember playing it with  other players all day for  a couple days and never feeling into it the quad split screen was a big nuisance  Thank goodness for online play today  the games today completely own goldeneye in every category especially the funfactor
So yeah  there you go nintendrones  the playstation brand rightfully won that gen and your crowning achievement in console gaming has turned out to be a dated and weak title Oh yeah Rare is now exposed as being mediocre  your cult like devotion to nintendo made them rich at least They havent made anything decent since thoughMario Kart  will always be the best I dont consider myself fully biased though This game really is that badThe game looks fine but it doesnt work I bought  games from this seller  of which did not workNothing at all like the SNES version Bad graphicslimited character rosterlimited moves and danger movesunresponsive controlsdreadful soundjust all around bad I wouldnt wish this port of KI on my worst enemy What a terrible disgrace to such a great gameWhat can I say this game was dumb  Its just a copycat of Mario Kart  and Mario Kart  has freakin fun  Diddy Kong Racing is a joke  I would have rated it as  stars but unfortunately I dont have that option  If you want to give someone a hate gift I recommend this  But dont blame me if they surprisingly love itPlease dont get extremist on me but I dont really like this game Its overrated and I will stick to the first Legend of Zelda thats way better than this Newer Zelda games are NOT my thingAS I ASKED WHO IN HISHER RIGHT MIND WOULD BUY THIS FOR A THOUSAND DOLLARS  Ill admit that Im a fan of Transformers  would buy any of them without a second thought  But Power Rangers  Its not worth a thousand dollars  dollars at the most and thats pushing itThis was the most boring game Ive ever bought  Dont let the description of multiple games with multiple characters fool you  Its one game that you go through with various times with different characters  The valiant  effort of a very nonlinear storyline was marred by the fact that it was so  nonlinear that the stories were often left being incoherent  Its tedious  going through the same miniquests over and over  Most of the characters  could have been a good choice to have their own full game
This was a  good idea playing through multiple games where you meet up with past  characters that you played but the games needs a huge overhaul in order to  give it more variety
If you have a LOT of time to kill and are very  easily amused and find this game for very cheap give it a whirl  Otherwise find a decent game or play Final Fantasy VII for the th time  It will be much more interestingDoesnt match the pic and I dont remember any mention of this by the seller Again European version Im sure it would work on a European SNESdefinitely came in rough shape the sticker practically peeling off the game and when you put the game it doesnt even work sold me a broken gamePeople say this game is great To what extent its great horrendousness if that is the case then yes this game is so hard and cant be beat unless cheated after world  the game is impossible just stick with sonic on sega genesis the graphics look like the NES even genesis is better just dont waste time with a snes console or gamesThe fact that those two wrestlers arent in this version of WWF Wrestlemania The Arcade Game is reason enough to avoid it  Yoko Zuna is a big guy with very powerful moves and Bam Bam is yet another big guy  Its odd how they didnt include either of the two BIG guys on the Super NES  Its not like this game has a lot of options and wrestlers anyway so to take away two wrestlers and leave you with only six is just ridiculous  Get the Playstation versionSo i bought this game and when i recieved it it was tucked away in a paper envelope just the disk and nothing elseand lo and behold when i take it out it has a huge crack in it making it unplayable so not only did i have to pay for an unplayable copy of it i had to pay for a brand new copy of it at  I might review the game when i actually play it but dont buy it without a case make sure when you order it it comes in some kind of protective casing not just a disk in a sleeve

Actual Game Review Duke is still the man even today
Score  out of 

Ok the only DN game i ever played fully was Duke Nukem Zero Hour so i decided to try antoher one and TTK seemed like a great choice since it resembled Zero Hourand its just as awesome the weapons are amazing with my personal favorite being the shotgun and the level design is fun and not to repetitive Graphics wise its not that bad but its a PS game from  but graphics dont make the game look at Metal Gear or Resident Evil and Duke Nukem is just as fun as those two If youre an action game fan a Duke Nukem fan or just want pure action big explosions bigger guns and Duke with an even bigger ego check this game outI sadly remember the day when this game was released  I had waited long enough and finally I had the game in my hands  I remember being so excited until about  hour into the game  It was then that I realized that  this game was terrible
The graphics were nice and the cut scenes were  above average  The voices sounded good and the combat was a little fast  but adequate
But I wasnt having fun  I realized that the game was  pretty deep and dwelling deeper into the games cool storyline would  require more of the bad AI terrible  I mean HORRIBLE combat system and  scrappy mouse driven interface  I couldnt take it anymore  I wished I  could just watch the game instead of play it then I would of been  happy
I did what I had to do and finally uninstalled it  I thought of  all the money I spent and went to find another game  What a tradgedy that  a game with that much potential had to be ruined by an obvious rushed  product  If your a gamer who likes fast action and addicting gameplay  then go buy Icewind Dale or Diablo  not this gameWhy do I rate this game  star There are several reasons First and foremost there is NO SAVEPOINT In short youll have to beat this game in ONE SITTING Talk about patience The second major problem that I have with this game is that it is trying to do too much It is a topdown shooter AND a firstperson shooter The graphics in the topdown mode are fine but the graphics and textures in FP mode are DREADFUL Doom has FAR better variety texturewise Personally I got headaches after playing in FP mode after  minutesand remember you cant save So the bottom line is this if you want to kill dinosaurs Id recommend Jurassic Park for the old NES and the Carnivores series for PC N has a Turok the Dinosaur Hunter series out Pass this game youll be glad you didIts not X I dont know what they were thinking when they released this piece of garbage X is a monster in this game and he sounds like an assThis review is hard to write because I am so mad that I wasted my money on this game Oh whoopie you can play as Zero the fighter butt zero is how much I shouldve payed for this game There isnt one thing about this game that I like The story is bad and the fight and graphics are absolutely awful If you want a real game dont waste your money on this Dont even rent this game This game is so bad it make Pong look goodthe game came in and had another persons name in white out on it and didnt even work waist of my cashNext to Sega CD the worst version of DOOM  The graphics suck and you can barely tell what anything is the sound is decent the one star the controls are horrid the gameplay is horrid and the shores of hell freezes up on start so all you really have is a butchered port of Knee Deep  Inferno with horrid controls  TerribleFirst of all Here are the PROS and CONS

PROS

Good for the people who own a SNES not PC

CONS

really bad graphics

slower animation than PC

you cant save the game

It is shorter than the PC version of doom

Overall 

This is a pretty good game but not for SNES

Get it on PC That version is alot betterWhat a disgrace to Marvel Neither Spidey nor the XMen come out of this with integrity left Its seriously one of the worst games I have ever played on the Genesis Terrible graphics worse gameplay and awful music Dont be like me and assume that it must be good because Spidey is involved I guess I should have researched it first coz it seriously is a bad bad game  It is sort of a cross between a sidescrolling beatemup and a runandgun game but succeeds at neither

It really just feels like any other generic platformer that was reskinned as a Marvel game halfway through development as very little of the gameplay feels unique to the characters Why is Spidey jumping up ledges to climb buildings Why is he not wallcrawling There is some crawling but it feels like an afterthought The character sprites are small and puny with little weight to the animation or impact to the action and the level design is haphazard repetitive and generic Sometimes youll even have difficulty identifying exactly what the environment is supposed to be As for the music wellits not memorable Its just noise honestly

Stay awayI bought this game a long time ago when it first came out  I wish I would have rented it first but I bought it anyway because it had Spiderman and the XMen in it  I have to say this game is just weak in all aspects of the game  The levels are boring and unimaginative and the characters and bosses are dull  I DONT recommend this game at allWhile this is a terrific game concept with some nice features it is far more work than play The core of the game is a standard X space empire builder with colony management a complex tech tree tactical space and  ground combat espionage and diplomacy But there is no centralized  display of colony status A building must be supplied with both power and  workers in order to operate and if it doesnt have enough of either it  will simply shut down and the game gives you no warning or announcements  You are forced to pause the game every few months and personally inspect  every single colony to discover these problems But the tech system is even  worse and has not been improved from IG There are three types of tech  and so you have to have three types of labs But you can only research one  invention at a time so while youre developing a new hyperdrive in your  ship labs your ground unit and colony facility labs are sitting idle  sucking up your colonys power and workers If you cant afford that waste  and most of the time you cant you have to once again personally remember  where you placed each one of up to  labs go to the colony display for  each planet on which you have a lab and turn the idle ones off one at a  time If you decide to develop a new building next you have to go around  and turn off all the ship labs and turn all the building labs on again And  I dont have room here to go into the games futile diplomacy system or  the sluggish screen redraw or the constant nagging interruptions by  messages regarding random events and spies demanding orders No offense to  the other reviewers here but only a hardcore strategy addict with a fetish  for micromanagement could enjoy this game I returned it four days after I  bought itFroze every  seconds and thats If I was lucky enough to get it started Good condition was hardly the correct description for this gameWhat the people who praise this POS software bundle dont tell you is that there hasnt been an update to download for over a year and there probably wont ever be another one The TRUTH is that it only runs a few games None of which anywhere on par with a real PSX
Its a complete waste of money unless your some techhead who wants to marvel at its shortcomings Get Conectix VGS if your looking for a Playstation emulator on PC What good is d card capabilities if it doesnt run any games to begin withthis game is too old to work on todays OSs After many attempts with dosbox and other emulation software I gave up

I did however get it to startoncebut it locked up and pixelated then crashed with a fatal errorso I looked online and it says that those of you hearing little rattles inside yes thats also a battery thing guess thats why it was glitching out and wouldnt save I dont have the ability to replace it or work on this game at all this looks like a shipping problem to meI thought originally the size of the files for the game just wouldnt load onto my laptop with a lot of space was taken Now I have a brand new desk top and the disk will not even begin to upload on to the desktop

Second game I have got from online that didnt workThis is a terrible game but good for the star wars collector now that everything in it is non canonI thought Red Alert was a pretty fun game This was just a clone of red alert though The people that make CC need to come up with some more ideas All the CC games are exactly the same I didnt like Red Alert to start with so Tiberian Sun has to be worseUnless you intend to cheat and mod the game dont waste your money Uneven gameplayand few options plague this gameit is also way too short even at this reduced price Spend your money on a gamejust not this one Hope this helpsI hate to have games collecting dustbut this is one of those and I own about  recent games so I know whats whatTheres many that love this socalled masterpiece but the only thing I like about this boringrepetitive game is the great soundtrack Sticking to the superior originalGetting this game would be a waste of time and money  For halfthe price of this Id rather get a game that offers better graphicsbetter realism and better everything  If you havent already guessed its Red Alert  Even though it looks pretty good after about a week you wont want to play it anymore  With Red Alert I continually go back to try just one more strategy I think they just sat down and set a deadline for this game and the guys making it waited until the last week to do it  Right now all you need to do is type in the search box up there Red Alert and buy that game You will have a way better game and not spend as much
