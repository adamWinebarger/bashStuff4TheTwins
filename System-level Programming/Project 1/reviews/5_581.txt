The one thing people are missing to consider about this game is that, if you notice, the collection is a collection indeed, and a fine one at that, but mostly shows how the Street Fighter series evolved.  If you note that it goes from Super Street Fighter II, to SSFII Turbo, to SF Alpha 2 gold.  Well, my point is that it shows in order how the series evolved to becoming more complex and technical with Super Combos added.  1st it starts with Super II, no supers at all, just classic, then goes to Super II Turbo, where the super combo made it's debut, and every body had only one super, then goes to Alpha 2 Gold, where it really shows what you can do with a super combo, plus more characters, and every body had atleast 2 super combos.
Lets go over it:
1st - classic with no supers lots of characters
2nd - classic with supers making debut same amount of characters
3rd - advance from 2nd with more characters and 2 supers for each
Not only that, but it's a classic game, mostly to me, just an example of the evolution of the series, if you are still looking for what you thought this game would be, get the 2nd one, otherwise, it's a wise decision to go with this one.
