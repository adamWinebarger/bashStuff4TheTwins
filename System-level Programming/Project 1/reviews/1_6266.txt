The way the light/magnifier is mounted on the gameboy places the lens too far away and thus you have to be looking straight at the gameboy, it can't be tilted left or right. Also the lights do brighten the screen but again, unless your looking straight on the lights will leave "hot spots" on your screen. "Hot spots" is when light reflects off the screen and makes it difficult to see. This product eats batteries and makes gaming harder. Not a good purchase.
