I found the game to be alright. I love the real board game, so the I was pretty excited to play the computer version...But if you are expecting a version exactly like the game, this isn't it.  There are some changes, like  payback and all that. ITs fun to pick your people, and get your house and  all that.  Its cool how it goes through the decades and all that.  If you  liked the game, I think you'll like the board game, but be warned: Like the  game, the mroe people that play, the better.
