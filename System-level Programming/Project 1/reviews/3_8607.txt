Is that pretty much the entire game was based of the movie "Bloodsport" with Jean Claude Van Damme. And as you may know, they filmed actual people to do the moves in the game to give it a realistic look, well they originally wanted Jean Claude to be Johny Cage. You may have noticed Johny Cage wearing the exact same outfit as Van Damme did in the movie, and also having the same moves, mainly the splits nut shot. Anyways, Van Damme turned the role down due to other obligations, but I found it very interesting anyways.

The arcade game was insane, I can remember the massive lines at the arcades to play it. You would have to wait a good 30 mins to get your turn, and if you knew the fatalities, you were golden. I only knew sub zeros, which was my favorite so i was fine with that. The gore was so awesome back then, it hadnt been done before so you can imagine the frenzy.

Unfortunatley, the SNES screwed us all over and censored the best aspect of the game. Imagine buying this expecting something you know to be awesome, only to see everything you love about something to be completly changed. Lets be honest, the actual fighting in Mortal Kombat is not really good. Its not fast paced and does not require much use of tactics. Street Fighter had it beat in that department. What it had going for it was the graphics and extreme gore. Take away the gore, and at least half the game is in the toilet.
