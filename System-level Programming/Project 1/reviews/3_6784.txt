This is the ultimate ant farm for those who can't afford one. You get an ant and you dig a nest. You bring green food to feed your queen. You avoid the spider. You repeat. You can while away hours and hours with this game,  digging away happily, but then you will suddenly realize that you were  digging for naught. Why?
- When you switch between yard quadrants, all  you work is replaced with a randomly-generated nest.
- The "warp  spot" is always in the same place.
- The ants do just as well with  your control as they do without such.
- The ultimate secret - tell to no  one: you can win the game by setting it to max speed and just waiting. The  ants will oust the reds, the humans, the dog and the lawnmower completel  without your supervision.
This game gives you the illusion of being an  ant. It also gives you the feeling of how worthless a single ant is. Try  this game. It grows onto you.
