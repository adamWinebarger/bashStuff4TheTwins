This review is hard to write because I am so mad that I wasted my money on this game. Oh whoopie, you can play as Zero the fighter, butt zero is how much I should've payed for this game. There isn't one thing about this game that I like. The story [is bad] and the fight and graphics are absolutely awful. If you want a real game, don't waste your money on this. Don't even rent this game. This game is so bad it make Pong look good.
