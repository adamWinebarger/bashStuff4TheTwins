Not even owning a Game Shark can make this game fun. Without it, you have to drop an elbow on your opponent 967 times to get the pin. With a Game Shark, a mere 960 times. All jokes aside, gameplay is extremely slow and irritating. In the time it takes to execute one complicated move, I could have made a hero sandwich, grabbed another drink, and went to the mens room. Controller response is so slow, it feels as if someone spilled a soda on your controller last week. I like what one reviewer said about the punches taking 3 hours to deliver. I couldn't stop laughing when I read that. By the way, I sold my WCW Mayhem game at my last yard sale, for $2. And that, people, IS TRUE.
