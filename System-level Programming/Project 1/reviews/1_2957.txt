Superman 64, after playing the game and reading the remarks made about this game - I question the existence of Titus why it was made!
Alright, on with the Review:
Graphics: Eye-bleeding! Don't look at them!
Controls: Don't start with me - they are slower than Molasses to make Supe perform his punches! Even the Multiplayer controls are near-unfinished!
Sound and Music: Ugh, don't question me -uninspiring; The Superman theme is nonexistent! Sound is low-budget, voice/acting is from the series but I'm definitely not in love with either them or this game!
Plot: Lex Luthor has trapped Lois Lane, Jimmy Olsen and Prof. Hamilton in a virtual world with Kryptonite fog in it and Supe has to go in and rescue them while putting down the Super-Villains Luthor purposely put there.
Fun Factor: This is not fun! For one, neither I nor my brother can beat the first level.  Supe both flying and running moves slow - if you try to fly: You'll have only ten-percent control over it! Not to mention the objectives you do are only for monkeys, you've got a timer for most of your objectives, this game is repetitive above all else, you have a health meter, a meter for all of your special abilities minus flying and you're gonna have to really try to get over your anger and impatience to beat this game!
And so: This is one of the worst games I've played, it literally ruined the Superman experience, pick up Spider-Man for the PSX, N64 or Dreamcast and enjoy the greatness it has to offer!
