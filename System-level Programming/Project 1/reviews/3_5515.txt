i think metal gear solid was THEE greatest video game ever and so i had to have this addition.  i was a little disappointed.  some of the msssions are a little drab.  the really good ones, where you play the ninja, do not happen till late in the game and so the fun is short lived.  some of the missions are so basic that i blew through them in no time and others so boring that i could finish them in my sleep.  this was not awful but not great and that leaves you with three stars
