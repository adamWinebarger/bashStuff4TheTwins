...I finally broke out of the hyptnotization that the game had gotten me into, and now I realize this game for what it is...I didn't like the game...battle.net is a JOKE. Yeah, you heard me. B.net gets about as FAR AWAY from 'quality' as you can GET. Yeah, I just love getting disconnected every 5 minutes and racing straight into the Black Wall of Death, and not seeing my messages appear for 5 minutes, and not being able to pick up items!
For another, this game gets extremely tedious after your first month. It's fun, and then, after you've beaten the game 60 times, you realize it for what it is- clicking. Over and over. Then clicking some more. OH GOD THE CLICKING NEVER STOPS. EVEN IN MY HEAD. AAAARRGHHH ITS DRIVING ME INSANE.
Really, though, I can almost guarantee that for 60% of you, in 6 months, you will no longer be playing. Either that or you will have gone insane by the CONSTANT CLICKING ...This is not an RPG, not by a long shot. About the only thing it has in common with an RPG is choosing classes and experience points. For one thing, it has none of the complexity that many loved RPGs have. Some of us LIKE flipping through inch-thick manuals, thinking 'OMGZ THIS IS SO COOL'. Plus, I have not seen a SINGLE person role-playing...Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. And this game is an enjoyable, wonderful game...for the first 3-5 months. Then the varnish all soaks off and you see the paint falling off the wood.
I would suggest buying this used, or waiting until it's somewhat lower priced...because you probably won't be playing it for a long time in the long run. ...
