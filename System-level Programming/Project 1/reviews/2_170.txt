the graphics aren't very good and the ship to shore radio is so distorted and accented that it is impossible to understand what is being said.  The game can be fun, but if you are looking for an ocean going version of microsoft flight simulator this isn't it.  It's not a lousy game, nor is it a great game, it's just okay.
