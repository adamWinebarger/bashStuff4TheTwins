This was exactly what I needed.
I have a Wii and PS3 and I needed to switch between them.
Well this does just that.

The connectors are well labeled, and gave a tight fit.
The switch is BIG and well marked and I really like that (so does my 6 yr old).
Works great.

The 'complaint' is not against the product at all - I'd buy another.
The thing to consider is the placement.  I would have liked if all the connections were on one side - or maybe the OUT to TV was at the bottom.  When this is on the shelf all the wires are visible and not easy to hide behind something.
