The 5 star review is for the n64 version only.  I liked the pc version ok, but somehow in a weird backward move, I believe that nintendo actually fixed this game.  I will probably be in a minority in this comment, as many hardened ID fans would vehemently disagree with this statement.  Fun times on the n64.
