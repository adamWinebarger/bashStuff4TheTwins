An interesting aspect of the Final Fantasy series was that all of the games were essentially an experiment. The first game was the ultimate experiment: will this game succeed or will Square go under? But each game was a stage in development.

FF- Choosing party, and character sprites in battle

(Before that, the Dragon Warrior games had battle head-on)

FFII- wound-developable characters

(Romancing SaGa later employed this, when you survive near death your hp goes up, when you fight alot attack goes up, etc.)

FF3J- simple job system (completely changes characters, no permanent skills)

FF4- Changing characters (a dark knight becomes a paladin)

FFV- Advanced job system (level up with one of the non-command skills to default class, and you permanently learn it, for instance the run skill you can learn from the thief, and then de-equip it)

FFVI- basic GF system (mainly just boosts skills)

FF7- basic weapon system

FF8- GF system

FF9- I heard it had some sort of advanced weapon system where different weapons learn different magic, never bought the game

Likewise, the plot in each was experimental. They fiddled around with the crystal concept in FF1, FF3J, FF4, FFV.  They had ruthless kings, dark overlords, and the occasional malicious squid. But the most intense game I have played so far was Final Fantasy 7. Why? Well, when halfway through the game your character doesn't even know who he is anymore, it is pretty interesting.  Not to mention you have combos to build, chocobos to raise and race (never was good at this), and some pretty weird items to collect (I mean honestly, what other game has you give some girl digestant in exchange for perfume and a dress for your male character to wear).
