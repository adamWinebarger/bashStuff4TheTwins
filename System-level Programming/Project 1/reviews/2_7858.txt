What a weird game.  I got this expecting the same type of thing that was going on in those great super nintendo games.  But hey, if you like confusing and weird puzzles than you might enjoy this game.  I suggest that you get it anyway but only to see how different it is than the dk country games.  This is a puzzle level game, not a dk country game.  I got bored and annoyed with it and stopped playing after having it for a few weeks.

These are my updated comments.  Recently, I challenged my review above and my view of this game.  I decided to learn how to get good at it, thus, leading to enjoyment of the game.  I actually got hooked, playing it for over 80 hours so far.  Point being, this game is not awful, it is, however, tricky.  If you enjoy Glover or even if you somehow found a way to enjoy Mario 64, you will like this game.  I would say that my new rating of fun would be 4 of 5 and my new overall would be 3 of 5.  The overall is still low because of how frustrating this game is.
