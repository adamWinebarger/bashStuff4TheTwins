I have played few games that were as funny as this one. Why? Take a bunch of game developers who hated the average controls of survival horror games, get a bunch of inept writers to scribble down a derivative plot with a nice hook and horrible dialogue, music composers who aspire to be better than John Williams, game designers who played WAY too many Super Mario games and anyone in marketing or professional game reviewing to pass the game off as a Survival Horror game and you've got a painfully hilarious game on your hands. This game doesn't do Sega any justice and don't believe the lie that this was their first Survival Horror game, they made their first two years before this on the Saturn and that game, Deep Fear, was art compared to this. I felt absolutely lied to when I played this game thinking I was in for the scare of my life when I found myself rolling on the ground after witnessing some of the silliest character models, inconsistent soundtrack, awkward dialogue, non-existent atmosphere, incomprehensible plot and obnoxious controls I've ever played on a DreamCast game. Your characters run so slow you'd think they had weights tied to their ankles, but their steps look so played out it's almost like they're waddling away from danger! You'll kill monsters who, despite being four legged monstrosities, will literally sprinkle you with gold coins! The overly dramatic music will play on and loop over and over again when nothing is happening! You want a farce? You've got nothing but farce in Blue Stinger.
