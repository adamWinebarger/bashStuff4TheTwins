Well, I must say that I was really disappointed by this game! I got my hands on it as soon as it became avayable. Having played for interminable hours with the original Civilization game I had great expectations from  this title. In the end it really turned out to be one of the worst sequels  ever!
The MAYOR SHORTFALLS ARE: 1- Game speed. By the time you reach the  space age you will not have been able to explore much of the world, and  will not have been able to build an army from a particular historical age.  Since the speed is so fast, by the time you have an army of, let's say  musketeers, you have already discovered planes and the nuclear bomb. THIS  IS VERY FRUSTRATING!  2- Units: Fewer than its predecessors and less  realistic. 3- The space age: It is only confusing and doesn't really help  to make the game interesting. 4- Unconventional units: You have now lawyers  and eco-warriors that work something like the spies in the original game.  In the end they end up beying only annoying and totally confusing! It would  have been better to add a more sound political and economic sistem to the  game and add a few varibles afterwards (i.e.: political movements and  private enterprise). 5- Customization: It is now impossible to customize  the game, like create new units as it was possible in CIV 2. I hate that!  6- Maps: Lacks a map of earth!  It used to be the only map I played on in  CIV 2!
IMPROVEMENTS 1- Graphics: Way better than the predecessors. Too  bad that the other features in the game didn't get quite to the same level!  2- Soundtrack: Improved somehow. 3- Combat: A tactical display now allows  you to actually play battles. Nice idea to start with, but it is somehow  badly put to work and has some incredible bugs (like archers that shoot  down stealth bombers! ).
My suggestion?  Wayt for a sequel or buy CIV 2!
