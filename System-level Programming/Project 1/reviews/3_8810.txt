This game is one of the good thriller's i've ever come across. It's a cooooool game with a good storyline but once the story ends the games over. I didn't feel like playing it more than once.
About the  problem people are having with the save game feature -all they have to do is press the "Esc" button on their keyboard and a box will appear asking them whether they wanna save their game or quit. So whenever u wanna save your game during game play at given time hit "Esc" on the keyboard and save your game, as soon as u do that u can continue with your game immediately. I didn't need to download any patches for the save game feature.
This game is a good buy. For those who haven't, try it.
