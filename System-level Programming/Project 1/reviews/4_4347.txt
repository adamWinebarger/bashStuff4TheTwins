half-life was efficacious in improve my hand-eye coordination which is compromised as a result of using narcotics for three years.  i'd like to find something that will improve my memory, but i've resigned myself to the fact that i'm going to have to re-study everything i've already learned.  yep, oxycodone does make you stupid.  just look at rush limbaugh.
oh - i'm getting sidetracked.  let's not digress.
ok, why did i give it only 4 stars ?
because after the patch to 1.1.1 and then 1.1.2 - the final comprehensive patch - freeman would still get stuck on lifts and elevators and die.
when he gets stuck you can't move him, or make him jump, and he takes damage and gets crunched.  i don't know why the patches never resolved this problem.
but the problem of getting stuck on lifts and elevators has a fix.  read some of the faqs.  if you jiggle the controller around a bit, freeman won't get stuck.
what else ?
every time i tried to load a saved game from the game, it would crash my system.  i had to exit the game, and restart the game i wanted.  i could save without a problem, and quick save and quick load (f6 and f7) worked fine.
the endgame was a little far fetched.  the game was well thought out, but the ending wasn't commensurate with the game.  it was episodic.
aside from the few snafus, yes, it was fun to play.  the health and hev dispenser are somewhat unrealistic.  i mean, getting health from a dispenser ?  only in a game.  but it was fun.
i'm glad i had an opportunity to play it.
and yes, i think it helped my motor skills.
