If the game defines multiplayer, this is the one.

Other than outdated graphics and poor single-player experience, it revolutionized first-person shooter with slick controls, intense difficulty, and fun multiplayer with up to 4 players and more than 10 maps and characters to choose from.

GoldenEye 007 was a blast from the past. The best movie-license game of the 007 franchise!
