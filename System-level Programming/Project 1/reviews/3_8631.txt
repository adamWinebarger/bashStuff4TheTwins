I must admit I have never been a huge Mortal Kombat fan, I obtained this game from my brother not working when he was moving.  I got it working and played it at bit to my surprise no blood!  I personally could care less about this because honestly I never cared about the gore factor anyway.  Aside from that and I know for some this is a major buzz kill, the game looks great and moves are easy to pull off just like another reviewer said.  However two major down flaws your character's walks and jumps aren't very fluent.  Also it seems kind of slow I remember this game being a bit faster, the game looks wise is amazing however (given the time context and the original arcade version).  To be honest tho I remember this game in the arcades and not being a fan really I say this one is the best.  I have 2 and 3 on an arcade classic pack for Gamecube and the controls are pretty bad as well and the matches end fast.  So all and all if you have the patients for this game and you don't mind the no blood and some what shoty movements you will want this game.  As for me I mark it as just your average fighting game for it's time.  I would suggest over this game Street Fighter Turbo!
