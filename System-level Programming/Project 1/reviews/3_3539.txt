So how does Resident Evil Code: Veronica compare with the previous RE games? Despite the new look and outstanding visuals, Resident Evil Code: Veronica hasn't really offered anything new, and instead delivers more of the same RE gameplay.
The story is very awkward. As the game progresses, Code: Veronica's storyline begins to lack the cool plot twists and startling mysteries found in the last Resident Evils. RE:CV relied on too much puzzle-solving to drive the story. There aren't any interwinding plots like before. Instead, the story reveals a weak cast of characters. This includes transvestites and unnecessary characters who have nothing to do with the main plot and RE storyline.
As you might expect, the graphics are mind-blowing. Its the best-looking Resident Evil yet. Gone are the pre-rendered backgrounds and still perspectives of the old games. Code: Veronica's sound is good, but has some bad voice-acting.
What's disappointing is that the dodge feature from RE3: Nemesis has been removed and the auto-aiming is so annoying, causing you to aim at unwanted targets and wasting ammunition. RE:CV's puzzle-solving, box-pushing, and switch-pressing will eventually become tedious especially to experienced Resident Evil players.
Resident Evil Code: Veronica pales in comparison to the other Resident Evil games in almost every area. Once you forget about the awesome graphics, you're left with nothing but the same Resident Evil we've been playing all along.
