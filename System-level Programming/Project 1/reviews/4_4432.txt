This game is great.  It has the same basis as Sim City only you control all aspects of an amusement park.  You are given objectives for each level that you must complete in order to unlock more levels.  Once you have completed all the levels, you gain the right to build your own amusement park with no restrictions.  The best part of this game is the fact that you build the rides individually.  You can create your version of the best roller coaster ever, and see if the guests like it as much as you do.  This game does get repetitive after a while though, as every Sim City type game does.
