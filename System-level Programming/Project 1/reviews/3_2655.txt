This game is great fun, especially if you've ever wanted to see the nintendo characters up close together, or just like simple, fun multiplayer. I like the powerups especially, like the home run bat from earthbound, a lightsaber, a bobomb, etc... However, there are some cons to this game as well. Mainly, for all other people claim differently, the characters aren't balanced. Link with an experienced player will whoop most other characters, and certain characters, such as the big and lumbering donkey kong are way easier to knock off the edge. Also, some characters like the unlockable jiggly puff are lame, single player is boring, and some of the arenas are tiny, making it near impossible to avoid getting knocked off if your character lacks some sort or float or teleport move. Still, great fun can be had by all. Also, samus is balanced in this one, as opposed to smash bros. melee where she has been nerfed.
