Being a big Wot fan, I couldn't wait for this game came out. But I only had a 386 PC! Then I got a much better PC, which left me with nearly nothing moneywise. Or I simply couldn't find the game. So I downloaded the demo--as one person said here, the demo is a horrible representation of the game, I'll take their word for it. But from what I did play, I was most impressed at first, playing it often, then there was a several-month period when I didn't play that game at all. The architecture is FANTASTIC in this game. Not exactly how I visualized it in the books, but pretty close. Multiplayer is Okay, but not great. The battle system, I think, is kinda clunky. When you need a certain ter-angreal right NOW it's hard to get to it without accidentally skipping over it. There isn't much of a variety of bad guys from what I've seen. Where's the Draghkar? Myrddraal? Darkhounds? Gray Men? etc. The atmosphere is nice in this game, though. Very dark at times. I'll probably still buy this game--hence the 3 stars. But if you want my real opinion, I feel that Robert Jordan's Wot series should be made by SQUARESOFT (the company that makes the Final Fantasy series). Squaresoft has EXPERIENCE with RPG's and if anyone could do justice to RJ's masterpiece, Squaresoft can. Like many of you have said, there isn't much of a quest element in this game. Anyway, I don't know about you, but I'm going to e-mail Squaresoft now and see if I can convince them to make something that will be what this game should have been.
