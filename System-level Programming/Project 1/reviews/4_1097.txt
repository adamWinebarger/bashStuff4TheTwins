Good graphocs, multiplayer mayhem, secret levels of which the first is kind of like a part of the movie "Moonraker" (earn this level by beating the game on secret agent) and the second of which is where you have to beat Baron Sameidei with the Golden Gun (earn this level by beating the game on OOagent). The game is not overly gory. If you shoot someone a red patch appears on there clothes, but it is hard to see on most of the 3d characters. With twenty levels in all and ten or so multiplayer areanas it is no wonder this game was voted game of the year in "Nintendo Power" magazine. The music is excellent and can really get you excited and it can also get you scared. The AI is pretty dumb on the agent setting, it develops about a fifty percent intelligence upgrade on secret agent setting, and on OOagent you had better find some cover! The game can take a while to beat if you want to get all the secret levels and secret codes for the game by beating the main game missions in a certain time with all of the objectives met. Have and watch out!
