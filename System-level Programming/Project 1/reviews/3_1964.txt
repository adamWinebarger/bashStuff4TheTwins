It doesn't get much better than Crash!!  I love all his games!  note to those ps2 UNsavvy people as myself... this will play on ps2 but you CANNOT save!!  You can write down all the little shapes they give you to save but be careful... one mistake and you loose your game! This was irritating.  So... I got out my old PS1... Memory cards from ps2 are NOT compatible with PS1... so I ordered a PS1 from ever reliable Amazon and all is good now in Crash bandicoot world.  People who live and breath Playstation... stop rolling your eyes at me and saying "duh".  This is just a hobby.  Live and learn!  Happy gaming!
