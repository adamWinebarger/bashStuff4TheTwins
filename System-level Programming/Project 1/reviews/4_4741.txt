If you've never played the Quest for Glories, then you're missing out on a lot.  They're really great games, with a combat system that is quite addictive.  My own, personal gripe with this collection is that I can't get  Quest for Glory 4 to work on my computer (it's too advanced).  Sure, I  could start all over, but my guy's a Paladin and he's got 300 points in all  statistics...  Still, these games are some of the best, and if you haven't  played them, or if you've wiped them off your hard drive, then this  collection is really worthwhile to get.
