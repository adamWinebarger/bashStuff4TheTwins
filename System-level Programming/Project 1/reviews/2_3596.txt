I simply find the game ordinary and boring. I really love the TV-show and was very much looking forward to the game.
Man I was  dissapointed!
There is nothing new in the game. It is simply an ordinary  shoot 'em up including the characters from South Park.
Admitted: There  are a few funny features in the game, the cow-shooting gun, Mr. Hanky the  christmas Poo but even these things gets quite boring after a very short  while.
My advise is: Enjoy the TV-show and use your playstation for  something else.
