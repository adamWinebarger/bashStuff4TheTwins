Bought a Gameboy Micro here on Amazon. It didn't come with a charging cable. So in a pinch I ordered one of these. It was to my house within 48 hours and it works great!!! This product does not work with Gameboy Advance or Advance SP, or the Nintendo DS/DS Lite/3DS/2DS lines. This is specfically for the GBMicro
