This game is one of two reasons to buy an N64.  It's excellent multiplayer, with enough shortcuts and tricks to perfect that's it's also a great solo game.  If you have an N64 and you don't have this game, then you should stop wasting your time and go out and buy it.  You could play the other games, but they are terrible...
