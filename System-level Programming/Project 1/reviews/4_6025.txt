Quake 2 was one of my first PC games and I loved it, even after all these years I still play it...A little..
The games plot is alright in some specks...I really didn't care for the story to be honest with you but The graphics on this game were great for the year it came out.
The game play was just OFF THE HOOK.  The game plays like doom but BETTER.  The enemy A.I was good too....Not the best but good.
The Best part of the game is of course...THE GUNS!!!!!!  The Guns just plain Kick a$$...
Also the game is fairl long...I enjoyed it..The game is pretty old..Probably 5 years old now.  I doubt you can find this game but if you can GET IT!  This game is not the best game ever made but it will be a solid fun filled game with top notch violence...yea the games pretty violent.
I haven't seen many FPS like Doom Or Quake 2...There great games
IF YOU CAN FIND IT GO OUT AND BUY THIS AWESOME GAME!!
Gameplay 5/5
Graphics 4/5..for its time
Length 4/5..
Over all.....4.5 out of 5
