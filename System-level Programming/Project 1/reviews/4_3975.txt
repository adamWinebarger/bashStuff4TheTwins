Great game but really hard and takes a long time to develop your skills, etc.  Very innovative for its time though... creating you own armor, weapons, and even food.  Also many characters to choose from given your decisions.  It's a bit old now so given everything not many people would play it through.  I believe I got to the last boss once but got demolished so gave up and deleted my file.  That was some years ago.  I have the PS2 version too.  Think I had the same issue but actually did better.  For some reason the last bosses in these games just pulverize you.  Give Rotney anotha chance! LOL... Jackie the Joke Man from Howard Stern reference
