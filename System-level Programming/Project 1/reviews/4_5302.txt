Fans of the series will tell you its worth the money it's going for but I think if you missed Suikoden II, you missed it.  Suikoden 3 is better afterall.  Even the reviewers will tell you.  I'm not saying this is a bad game, it was actualy a very good one, but it's not worth shelling out 150 dollars for.
