Showtime is a good game with all the pushing and roughhousing and all the mayhem. What i am trying to say is any basketball fan who whants to play basketball games where its played the rightway do not buy showtime. Here are some examples for instance,you can pretty much punch the living pulp out of the player to steal the ball and the dunks are unrealistic and last but not least everybody shoots way over averege in the game. So anybody who loves basketball with no rules get this game the only problem is that the options get old real fast.
