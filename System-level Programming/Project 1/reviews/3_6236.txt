Rayman 2 is a decent game.  I bought this game mostly for my younger brother, but ended up playing it a lot myself, remembering the first Rayman game I had on PC a few years earlier.
The graphics on this game are some of the best suited for the N64.  There are other games, with better graphics, but those are games like Perfect Dark, which has realistic characters that under 64 bit graphics still look choppy and somewhat ugly compared to the newer consoles.  Rayman 2's graphics are cartoonish in nature, so the lower quality display does not effect them too much, therefore the game wouldn't look all that much better on the PS2 or Gamecube.
The one thing that I did have a problem with in this game was the camera!  The camera usually places itself dirrectly behind the character, but seems to have a mind of it's own 75% of the time.  And although you can control it to an extent, it always snaps back to the over the shoulder view once you start moving again.
All in all a good game, both for younger gamers, and older gamers who just want to goof off and have a little fun.
