Story
 wasnt  impressed        concept Ive      vague   section   potential buyers wont   story spoiled  

GOODUnique
  boil     basically fighting   ecoterrorist  thats   concept

BAD
  integration   story   poor   look     background stories  doesnt  sense          spent     discussing     common goal   ECOterrorists   fit  Aside        ecoterrorists  live    beat  community      common

         introduced     playing Cloud  incredibly angsty  selfcentered   beginning   found   social scenes centered     unpleasant  friendship  Tifa doesnt   sense    Tifa   sweet person  portrayed  kindhearted      obsessed  Cloud      emotionally Barret um    racist Barret   black person    consistently beats  chest   gorilla Yes    black person look  act   gorilla

Gameplay

Mediocre

        people   tend    story   nearly       story  bad    phenomenal      engaged         average    pretty typical timer setup   write home  Im      invented timer    Kudos  Square Enix  timer     beginning       literally thrown      instructions     little     hang       figured      hr        scenes  quickly grew tired   

Summary
   average   terrible story horrific graphics    late    pretty pathetic   played   hours        free   limited    waste     arent fun      Maybe FFVII  picks   hour          disappointed     Im  incredulous    reviews   Amazon    gaming sites

UPDATE
Barrett   Cloud  introduced  headquarters Barrett beats   chest   gorilla   found    poor choice    black       doing   overall portrayal     racist    played   hours   claim   treated
