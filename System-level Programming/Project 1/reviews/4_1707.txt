I din't get this game until almost a year ago, but I still find it to be pretty fun. It has a tiny roster (with only ten guys) that is EXTREMELY outdated, but I recognized most of the guys, several of them being among my favorite wrestlers. (The only one who was completely unfamiliar to me was Ahmed Johnson.) I think the graphics are really good although the wrestlers aren't very large on the screen, and the gameplay is done pretty well. No, the game isn't very realistic, but I think that just adds to the fun! Some people seem to have issues with the load times, but I don't really think the load times are bad at all. I've played games that have much longer load times! I think this game is much better than WCW Vs. The World (which is one of the only two other wrestling games I have for PS1), even though that game has many more guys on it!
