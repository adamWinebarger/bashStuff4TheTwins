This game is alright.  It is pretty fun and kind of scary but the game has alot of backtracking that gets annoying.  Dinos become very smart and mean.  This game is fun but just get ready for a couple of hours of boredom before you get to the real action.  The puzzles are pretty hard as well.  The music is pretty good.  This game is decent over-all.  Buy if you are looking for something different than zombies chasing you around.
