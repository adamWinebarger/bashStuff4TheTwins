Never having played a spyro game before, I figured I'd start with the first one which I downloaded off the Playstation Network on PS3.  At first I was turned off by the camera control and graphics, but once I realized how fun the game was, it was no longer a problem.  I did everything in the game for 120% in a matter of days, as I found it to be very addicting.

The gameplay consists of exploring a few hub worlds which are connected to various levels where you must free dragons, collect diamonds and defeat the bad guys.  Some levels include full flight, which adds some much needed variety to the core gameplay.  The boss battles were the weakest part, as they didn't really stand out and were pretty tame.  Games nowadays are so complex that it was a pleasure to play something so simple.  Running around colorful worlds, collecting multi-colored diamonds and discovering secret areas are always a good time, and Spyro is the purest form of these ideas.

The simplicity of the gameplay combined with the variety in worlds/levels ensured it never got boring.  Just pure light hearted fun!
