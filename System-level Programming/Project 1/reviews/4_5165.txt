One of the things that always made D&D annoying for me to play was that the GM could rarely be completely cold and fair in regards to die rolls.  sometimes the GM would pick a favorite class or a favorite PC and  they'd always come out better than others.  Well, in Baldur's Gate the GM  is the computer so everything is fair and impartial.
On the singleplayer  aspect the game is fun.  You can be whatever type of person you want to be  and do whatever you want.  You can be a noble paladin ot a scoundrel  thief... it's up to you.  As you progress through the game you gain  experience and abilities and learn more and more about why people are  hunting you.
On multiplayer it can be fun if you have the right group.  The story is the same as it is in singleplayer except one member of your  party is the main character while the rest of the group are backups.  If  you have a group with enough imagination you can have a game that lives up  to any tabletop D&D game.
In actual gameplay, a lot of what you do is  travel from place to place and quest.  Sometimes you encounter people who  want to talk to you and sometimes you run into a pack of monsters to kill.  The interface reminds me a bit of Diablo, but the games are not clones of  each other, I assure you.
Although the game is slightly buggy that  cleared right up with a patch.  I also like the ability to customize your  character portraits and sounds, it makes the roleplaying aspect all the  more real.
