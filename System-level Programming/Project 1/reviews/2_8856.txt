Given the pre-release hype from game sites, I was really anticipating this game as the contender for the best RTS this year. I'm pretty disappointed.
The good first: The game looks very nice. It has that same  techno-organic look as Battlezone 2, not surprising since the same guys did  it. It runs fairly nice, aside from the crashes. The framerate and overall  running is probably the smoothest I've ever seen on a 3D RTS, even  Homeworld. The interface is also quite well thought out, and a step forward  over other 3D RTS's, particularly the ease of camera movement.
Other than  that, the game is a dog. Sorry, fanboys, but I have to call it like I see  it. Gameplay is a real snoozer: Tons of dicking around and not much combat.  Everything is just deliberately slow--aircraft move as slowly as infantry  on foot, et cetera. If you are looking for fast, furious, exciting  gameplay, this is not the place to find it.
The unit pathfinding is set  up in such a way that they all move one at a time so that they don't  obstruct each other. Thus, you'll move one unit, and if any others are in  its way they will all, agonizingly, move one at a time to new positions so  the mover can get through. In any movement of groups this problem is ten  times as bad. You'll watch in frustration as your units get ripped to  shreds while they stupidly maneuver into position before they start  returning fire.
No real story is going on here; there are no characters  and nothing happens inside of a mission to alter the plot. There are some  vague cutscenes between the missions, but they're so irrelevant that you  could have just played the missions and made up your own story to string  them together.
Overall, I regret having bought the game. I can't  recommend it unless you're compelled to get an RTS fix.
