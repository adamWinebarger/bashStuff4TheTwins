While some reviews hail this as a Resident Evil with Dinosaurs it's much more than that. The characters were great,and the story line is awesome. The only complaints I had for this game were the camera angles, some were very infuriating! The game play is solid, and this game is an instant classic. I would recommend picking this game up at the cheap price it is being sold for before it's too late! Fast shipper as well, and prompt service!
