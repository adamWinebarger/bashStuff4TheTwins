The Good: Fast fun gameplay, nice graphical style, some of the best video game music ever created, long, good story

The Bad: Extreme difficulty can really turn some people away, the age here shows quite a bit

I never played this game before until now. I was too young at the time to really understand the game. Now that I've played it I understand why it got it's praise and I don't understand at the same time. What really makes me not like this game as much as other people is the extreme difficulty. Either that or I just suck at the game. I'm not really good at 2D platformers to begin with but this game does deliver on all accounts.

It has a great story, great graphics, fast fun gameplay, you can equip stuff on every body part you have (ahem), you can buy things! While I'm not a huge Castlevania fan to begin with (first CV ever was Lament of Innocence (PS2). I'm not saying this game is terrible but for me the difficulty was way too hard for me. I just couldn't get past the third stage.
