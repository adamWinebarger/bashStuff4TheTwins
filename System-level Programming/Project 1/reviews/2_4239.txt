On the face of things, "X-Wing Alliance" has the makings of an extraordinary entry into the Star Wars franchise.  The characters are engaging, with enough backstory given in the accompanying written material  to start a small movie.  Conveniently, there *is* actually a small movie  which opens the game off with a real narrative bang.  It makes one wish  that Lucas himself had taken a page from the game producers when he was  making _The Phantom Menace_.
Unfortunately, after this high point, the  game soon degenerates into endless missions which advance the  plot--painfully slowly.  Oh, there are cool points along the way.  The cut  scenes are interesting, and the sound environment throughout the missions  is superb.  But the in-play graphics engine is fairly ordinary by  LucasArts' own standards.  The missions themselves are endless variations  on the same themes.  And the game's conclusion is less than satisfactory.
But there's another side to the game--multiplayer action--and for this  the game deserves some praise.  As a vehicle for capturing the gaming  possibilities of the Net, "X-wing" is worth the purchase price.  There's a large, loyal player base for the whole "X-wing" series,  so you'll never be alone on the Net.
Still, there are better options to  get what you want out of a Star Wars game.  "Rogue Squadron" is  an infinitely better single-player space game.  And the upcoming  "Force Commander" promises to be something of a new standard in  multiplayer action.  By comparison, "X-wing Alliance" merely  feels like a solid update to an aging series.
