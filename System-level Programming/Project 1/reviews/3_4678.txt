Outlaws was released in 1996, and was one of the last 1st-person shooters to retain a sprite-based game engine over a true 3D polygonal one. It's also one of the few western-based shooting games on the market.

You're Marshall James Anderson, a former lawman who takes up the badge again when a railroad baron's goons kill your wife and kidnap your daughter. You'll fight through nine stages, including ghost towns, mines, cliff dwellings, and saw mills on your quest for revenge. Bonus missions send you on bounty-hunting quests for those thugs you never saw during the main game. Lucasarts really nailed the spaghetti western atmosphere and trappings with lots of animated cutscenes and excellent voice work. You can also pop the game CDs into your CD player and hear the highly memorable full-length soundtrack.

But there are problems with Outlaws' gameplay. The environments are still pretty decent, but the enemy sprites were average by 1996 standards, and look pretty bad today. Some of the levels can be disorienting and confusing, and the missions fall into key hunts that aren't much better than the original DOOM. There's really no sense of direction except to run around and open passages until you meet the boss. Bosses aren't as distinctive as in other games, and you might not know you've killed one until the game jumps to a cutscene. To its credit, Outlaws included elements that later became staples of the shooter genre, including having to manually reload (bullet by bullet!), a sniper rifle, and a stamina meter where your character becomes slower and out of breath the longer you run.

I can't say there's much reason to buy this title today if you've been raised on shooters like Half-Life and Halo, but if you're a collector of Lucasarts games and want to experience the high-quality cutscenes and soundtrack, Outlaws is a must-have.
