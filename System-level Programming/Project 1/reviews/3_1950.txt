Product arrived far sooner than I had expected, and arrived in great condition, save for a few scratches here and there on the disc.

Aside from a little scratch or two, the game plays perfectly, and just as well as I remember it in the good old days. Back when game developers focused on the structure of the game and not just the graphics or any fancy sh** like that. This was back when 90% of the games at the time were all good, simple, and had such great repetitive value. Back when the ruling mascots were Crash, Mario and Sonic. Damn, it just brings tears to my eyes I tell ya.

My only real nitpick for this product was the case it came in, the jewel case was flimsy, and the tape holding it close was not really necessary, so it broke when I tried opening it. Aside from that, I am satisfied in the long run. I recommend this seller.

[UPDATE][UPDATE][UPDATE]

A little update on the product. The game plays alright up until a certain level very close to the beginning; 'Rolling Stones' to be specific, then it just flat out freezes and sits there. This really doesn't surprise me, these games are almost 20 years old, and it is rare to find a used one in perfect condition. I'll give this one game a little extra time and try multiple times to see if the level will play.

I won't change my opinion about this seller, I am not frustrated, or anything. I got the game in a great time window, it was cheap, and it works at least. Just a little advice to anyone distributing aged games like these; I'd suggest trying to at least play these used games through and make sure they work 90% at least. Time consuming? Maybe, but in the end, the seller gets money, and the customer gets their money's worth and their satisfaction is guaranteed. Fair trade, everyone wins.

I'll give it another week or two of trying it, if I can't get it to play past that point, then I may be returning it.
