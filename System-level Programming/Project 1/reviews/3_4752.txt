If I had a choice between SC 2000 or SC 3000 I'd have to say I'd choose 2000 though its graphics are not as good it's a lot more fun and easier to start.  I'll have to admit when I first began playing I was shamelessly addicted.  But after two days of playing I had my map completely filled and no more room to build.  The game is fun for a short while but gets old real fast.  I still highly reccommend this game for a boring tuesday afternoon.
