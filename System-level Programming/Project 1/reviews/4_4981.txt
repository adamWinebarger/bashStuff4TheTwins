One of the best FPS for PS One.  Great graphics with a surround sound option.  Comtrols leave a bit to be desired as far as customization goes.  Not much for scares or surprizes and still mildly inferior to the legendary original.

Highly recommended to anyone who still plays the old PS.

Great shipping and condition of product.
