you just drive tanks around and blow stuff up.its just like that.the objectives are very decieving.itll say like just go over across the bridge.but the bridge is across town and on every corner is a team of tanks armed with lasers, nukes,mines and all kind of nasty stuff.me and the ol lady beat it in one afternoooooooooooooooooooon.so what to do then?well theres a really great deathmatch section.go there and play your friends.the computer is a bit more powerful than on the regular game.by a bit i mean HELL KICK THE CRAP RIGHT OUT OF YOU.so be careful.whats also fun is to go into a big city on death match like san fran sisco with a buddy and kill all the computer players as a team.then just go around and level the whole city brick by brick.one very cool thing is the nuke.you set it off and well.......youve heard all about it in school.try it out.its awesome!
