I don't know, I bought this game way back when thinking it was going to be like Baldurs Gate..... Big Mistake.  While the graphics and interface where similar I just didn't comprehend it.  Maybe if they would have had a thing  where you could travel to other plains like Dragonlance or the Forgotten Realms it would have been better, but all in all the game seemed... moderate at best.  Like I said, maybe it is just me, but where Baldurs Gate succeeded, this game failed.
