This has to be one of the best multiplayer games created for the Nintendo 64. This kind of game is great for all ages. I'm 18 years old and my friends and I still, to this day, continue to play Mario kart. It is a perfect racing game that has great sound effects and can keep you entertained for hours. You can play it by yourself, but to get the true experience of this game its best to play it with others. There is really no story line to the game, just a bunch of maps and characters to choose to race with. If you get bored of racing over and over again, there are several mini games, known as battle games, to choose from. Honestly, I like playing the battle games more than I like racing because its fun to take down your friends and family! So, overall I would definitely say get this game if you don't have it! It is a must buy for avid Nintendo 64 users!
