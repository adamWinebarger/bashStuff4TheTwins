The following is the review of the SYSTEM, not the games that can be played on it. First off, at first I thought that the controller would be pretty clunky due to its size. But in actuality, it is fairly light and fits nicely in one's hand. Bigger-handed people might have a problem, though. What I REALLY like about the controller is that ALL buttons are accessible without having to remove your hand from ANYTHING. Unlike that stupid N64 system that has buttons in the most unreachable places in the heat of battle. I didn't see the point behind the little video-game screen on the controller, though. To me, it just weighs it down more and--let's face it--why bother playing pixally games when you can play your Dreamcast? One thing that I like about Playstation is that the memory cards are inserted into the system, not the controller. Wise move. But unfortunately, Sega didn't have the foresight to do that. As for the system, it is slightly smaller than a Sony Playstation. Graphics run really well on this system and I'm surprised at what it can do. There is one thing that I have to say about the 4 Megs of Video RAM on Playstation /PS2 versus the 8 Megs of Video RAM on Dreamcast. When I watch a Final Fantasy FMV on Playstation, I know that they are pushing that system TO THE ABSOLUTE LIMIT. If Dreamcast has TWICE the Video RAM, then I expect to see something TWICE as impressive, something that is so graphically intense that it threatens to overheat the system. But sadly, I haven't seen any Dreamcast game do that. In fact, some of these games look like the regular Playstation could handle them. Overall, this is a nicely designed system, but now that Sega is putting an end to its Dreamcast games, it's not worth buying. I'd buy a Playstation 2--Metal Gear 2 is around the corner (and FF X) or maybe a Nintendo Dolphin.
