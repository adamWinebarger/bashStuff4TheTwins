After playing Heroes of Might and Magic 2 for years I was excited about Heroes 3. But, after I got the game I thought it was just Heroes 2 all over again. All that was really done to the game was add several creature, take away a few creatures, mix the towns up a little, and slap better graphics on it. Though I must admit that it was just as fun (and pehaps even more fun) than Heroes 2. One of the greatest things about this game is the plot and story (much better than Heroes 2.) If you're thinking of buying this game, and don't have Heroes 2, then know that it can be very addicting. If you do have Heroes 2 then only buy this game if you want better graphics and a few new creatures then go ahead and get it.
