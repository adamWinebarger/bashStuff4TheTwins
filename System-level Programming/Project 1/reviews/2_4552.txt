I loved the first two Gabriel Knight games ("Sins of the Father" and "The Beast Within"). They were creepy, well-researched, and had great atmosphere.
Well, "Blood of the Sacred, Blood of the Damned" had great potential -- Rennes-le-Chateau and vampires! Neat! But poor gameplay really squandered that potential.
To give you an example of what I mean, one of the puzzles involves getting a vehicle so Gabriel can get from one place to another. A perfectly good motor scooter (I think; it's been a while) is available. But noooooo ... Gabriel refuses to ride something so wussy. He has to have a big motorcycle. So that's the puzzle -- getting the selfish jerk a motorcycle to ride.
Let me get this straight. He's a detective trying to solve a case, but he's going to waste time finding a cooler ride?
That was the point where I threw the game out the window, so I can't comment on how it ends, unfortunately. The voice acting was pretty lame; I don't know who told Tim Curry he could do a New Orleans accent, but he can't.
Now that [the price has dropped], it's worth trying if you're really into Gabriel Knight. Otherwise, there are much better adventure games out there that are also dirt cheap. Try one of them.
