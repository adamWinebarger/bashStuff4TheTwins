Literally too, expect your clicking finger to be tired after playing this game.  It's just hours clicking on the screen endlessly to hack and slash the enemies.  I don't even know why this game is called an RPG...it's more action than RPG...
The good thing about it is the CG cutscenes.  Flawless, the best cutscenes in any game.  Period.  Other than that, not worth the money.
