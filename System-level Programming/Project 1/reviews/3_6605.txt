I actually really liked this game -- or most of it.  The scenery was beautifully rendered and the locations were interesting.  The story line was not really very compelling, however.  It was more of a reason to put you in the game in the first place than a driving factor, but that didn't bother me too much.  I also liked the puzzles, many of which involved lateral thinking and looking around the environments for hidden clues.
However. There were an awful lot of bugs in this game and it crashed frequently.  And it seemed that just when things were starting to get interesting, it was over.  The ending was abrupt and dissatisfying.
If you're jonesing for an adventure game, go ahead and play it because there are many enjoyable moments. But you might want to borrow a friend's copy rather than buy it.
