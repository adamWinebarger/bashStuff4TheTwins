This is the best N64 (R.I.P.) game I have ever played. It's full of vast 3D worlds, cool characters, and has a deep storyline. The worlds are huge. Take Hyrule Field, A place which has absolutely nothing to do with the story but going there to get new places, is soooo much fun. When you aren't doing anything and are just playing around, you can have hours of fun running around hunting skullkids and running from those flying spikey flower thingies. When you're an adult, you can hunt poes (ghosts) in the field and get rewards and stuff for it! Anyway, the story is about a boy named Link who is destined to save his home world, Hyrule, from A powerful wizard. The wizard wants to get ahold of the Triforce, an ancient artifact which has the power to alter the world. He does, and changes the world to a "hell". Link then has to go through many dungeons and meet many people and eventully save his land of Hyrule and return peace. That's about it. Peace.
