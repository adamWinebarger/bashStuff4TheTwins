A Game that is still in my library with its sequel..  Yeah I like it that much, found it addictive and imaginative as well.  It is date by today's standards and likely the online play is dead as it was when I attempted to play there.  Not to mention those out there playing online are usually hardcore and own any new people as well which was a major frustration when I finished first person a long time ago and attempted to go online haha.  This game was fun with its story and is one I consider reloading at times after so many disappointments with newer games that just don't satisfy someone who has played for so many years nor someone who wants to spend so much for so little these days.  Today's game are pretty much knock offs, level racing, mindless hack and slash, limited originality, limited character uniqueness and profit versus gamer motivated today as well.  If you want to give it a try I'd say it is worth the ten bucks..  If you really like it the sequel is good as well.  Space Command and Conquer is a good way to think of this game with a mobile mother ship for game play though it is more multi-directional that c and c..  Control might take a little to get use to but who expects a game to practically play itself lol..
