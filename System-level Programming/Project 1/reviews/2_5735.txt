This game is way too hard!  I enjoy a challenge, but this is ridiculous!  I grew frustrated on the easy setting and anything above that is more  infuriating than fun.  What is fun is playing with two players, but even  that doesn't make it any easier.  I would say if you can get this game for  under ten bucks and only want about five or six hours of gameplay out of it  it is worth it.
