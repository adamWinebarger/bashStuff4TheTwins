Let me start off by saying, I am not "FanBoy"! I am not into the name brand war. I am a gamer, I play on any console and format (PC/Arcade/DC/PS/PS2) Reasons to buy a DC:
1)The console is the cheapest out of the consoles coming out.
2)The games and the graphics for them pretty much hold there own against the PS2. Awesome sports lineup and online play! Being realistic of course, eventually the PS2 may surpass the DC due to the advanced harware on the PS2, its now up to the game makers to utilize the full potential of the PS2, which is probably around a  year away. The PS2 still needs to mature before you see its true power.
3)The console is available now. While you wait for the PS2/Xbox/Gamecube. You can have and play a DC now, with plenty of great games! Plus by waiting the price of these other consoles will come down and there will be plenty of titles for them by then. Good things comes to those who wait(Cheaper price, more games, more availability!)
4)Online play. The best opponent is a human opponent.
Bottom line: It's cheap (for the console and performance it provides, it can't be beat), Plenty of titles to choose from (3rd generation titles coming out soon), It's available now and it's got online play.
