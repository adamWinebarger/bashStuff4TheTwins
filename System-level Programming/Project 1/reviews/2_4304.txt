In the exact sense of the word, the game cheated me. The suspense built up by the time you finish the third level culminates in one of the most shocking and innovative pieces of plot I have seen to date. What's the  problem? The remainder of the plot is a piteous attempt to bring the  innovation and tie it onto the "and all was well" ending.
The  graphics are amazing, although there is way too much green, and you spent  less time in original-looking levels than in the "normal" ones.  Nevertheless, from the beginning, they look quite surreal and amazingly  life-like. More than that - they are aesthetic. The main character is  pretty much non-existent, snce he has no lines, and his only role in the  game is to capture monsters. The battle engine offers far too few choices,  since upgrading your character's equipment is nonsense (he rarely enters  actual combat), and you can't equip your monsters. Therefore, the game's  central and only concept is to go through level after level, capturing and  merging monsters. There's nothing more to the game. Oh, yes, there are  several original parts (you earn money by selling the captured monsters),  but they are too few.
