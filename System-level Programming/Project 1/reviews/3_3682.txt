Eh. Sorry but this title does not deserve the title RE3. While the gameplay was exceptional, this game did not capitalize as a follow up to arguably a top 3 survival horror title in RE2. The story is to simplistic and replay value is horrendous. While the other games introduced different and compelling stories, this did nothing but introduce Nemesis following you around.
