Back when this game first came out, it was a groundbreaking effort for extreme sports video-games, most of which were, (and for the most part, still are) mediocre at best.  The tricking system was simple, and easy to learn.  The level design was the best in the genre, and the level objectives were fun.
  But that was three years ago.  Today, even for the incredibly cheap asking price I just can't recommend purchasing the original game in this series, beacuse for just a few dollars more you could do a whole lot better with any of the sequels in the series.  Provided, the latest two sequels (3 and 4) were primarily designed for next-generation consoles, but they did come out on PLaystation 1, Game Boy Advance, and dare I say, Game Boy Color, so you should be able to find the game of your choice on the platform of your choice.
