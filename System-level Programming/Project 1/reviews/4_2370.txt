THERE ARE SIX LONG TRACKS TO RACE ON. I'VE ONLY SEEN FOUR.. COVENTRY COVE, MOUNT MAYHEM, INFERNO ISLE & SUNSET SANDS. THE TRACKS I HAVE YET TO PLAY ARE.. METRO MADNESS & WICKED WOODS. MY FRIENDS AND I LOVE THIS RACING GAME. IT IS WELL MADE, NICE LOOKING & EASY TO CONTROL. YOU MUST BEAT THE INDIVIDUAL TRACKS ON CHAMPIONSHIP MODE FOR THEM TO APPEAR ON SINGLE RACE & TWO PLAYER MODES. I LOVE THE BOOST BOXES, THE SHORT CUTS, THE CAMERA OPTIONS & BEETLE BATTLE MODE. IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A QUAILITY RACING GAME AT A NOW AFFORDABLE PRICE.. "BEETLE ADVENTURE RACING" FOR YOUR N64 IS AN EXCELLENT CHOICE.
