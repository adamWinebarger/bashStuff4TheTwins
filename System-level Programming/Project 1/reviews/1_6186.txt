If you want yet another dogfight game, here it is.  If you want a game where you feel as though you are commanding a starship, as depicted in the Star Trek movies, you had better pass.  Cut scenes?  Wow, impressive, and  with David Warner no less!  Graphics? NONE BETTER!  Neat way to blow stuff  up?  Oh, yea!  A great game for those under 30 with cat like reflexes.  No  cunning needed here.  However, you had better be more practised in an  immelman turn than the corbomite bluff if you want to suceed at this game,  and that precisly is the opposite of what is advertised.
