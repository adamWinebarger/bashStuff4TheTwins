This is one of the best games I have ever played.  Even shooting the arrows is fun, you can actually use your shield to block getting hit.  Just incredible.  The only bad thing I can possibly say is you almost have to buy the strategy guide or else you will likely get stuck on some levels.  There are a few dungeons that I could not find my way out of without buying the guide.  But overall great game!!
