This is the best platform game I've played, and eliminates all down sides of its two prequels.  You're a bandicoot and jump on / spin baddies you encounter.  This game is kind of like old Mario games, but has awesome graphics.  They've added a type of box to the prequel and give one move, such as bazooka or tornado death spin, for each boss.  The game is easy to beat, but offers extras for breaking all the boxes or beating a level quickly.  It's extremely difficult to collect all of them.  I recommend this game for everyone, especially people with a lot of free time on their hands.
