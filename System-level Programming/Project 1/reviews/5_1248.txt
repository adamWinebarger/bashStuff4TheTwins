The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of time is the best zelda game there is! You go from being a kid, to being an adult! Link must beat five temples as an adult, the forest temple, the fire temple, the water temple, the shadow temple, and the spirit temple. The bosses are awsome, and all the characters are cool!
