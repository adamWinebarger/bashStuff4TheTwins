Final Fantasy 7 is another excellent game made by Squaresoft. The same company that made Bushido Blade and Saga Frontier. It was the reason many  people bought the Playstations they own and defiantly the one of the best  during the year it came out.
As far as game play goes its excellent. The  controls are standard to RPGs. Combat basically is turn based (which I  highly prefer) with a little bar that goes up as it gets closer to your  turn. It has several very fun mini-games. Also there are many characters  who show an actually personality during the game. There are several  Vehicles you get as the game goes by to help you with your long trips  across the large world.
As far as plot it's well done. Plot being the  most important part to an RPG its good to see this game was strongest in  this area. Even though I won't reveal much on the plot I will tell you it  surprises you many times. Like most RPGs you don't get a lot of control  over the plot but that's fine it's still a good game. The plot doesn't  start to shake and get lost around the end it keeps you stuck form  beginning to finish.
The graphics are wonderful for their time. However  newer games like final fantasy 8, Parasite Eve, and Metal Gear Solid are  defiantly better. Often the characters seem a bit boxy in it. The  backgrounds almost always look beautiful though.
And finally as far as  length of time it can stay interesting is a long time. Final Fantasy 7 is  not a game you well beat in four or five games. You well defiantly have to  buy this game to beat it. It's well worth the price though.
Overall this  game is good. I am one of those self-important jerks who things ff3 was the  best though, but it did come close. It is defiantly worth playing.
