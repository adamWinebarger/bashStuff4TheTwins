This is one of the best kids video games i ever played! The graphics were pretty good for the n64. The things you have to do are a little challenging but not to hard. I don't know why it labeled as a kids game just because it based off a kids movie. Its a great game for kids and adults. The only thing that is frustrating is that its one of those n64 games that actually needs a memory card! Other then that its a great game and a must have if you want a fun game and are a fan of the movie!
