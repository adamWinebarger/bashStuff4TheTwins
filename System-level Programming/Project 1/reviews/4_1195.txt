I got this on the GameCube Collector's edition and really, it's confusing how they DIDN'T make this the best game of 2000, 2001, 2002 and 2003. They DID make it the best game of 1998 and 1999 but anyways, there's a master quest version out there for GameCube. The sites are beautiful. And when u get inside the Deku Tree, let the action/fantasy begin!
