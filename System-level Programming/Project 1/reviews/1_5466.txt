I don't know what everyone else sees in this game and why they consider it so addicting and cool, it, like Quake 3 is just mindless shooting only leaving you angry. Everyone in the UT community rocket jumps, a cheap way of getting a quick kill, and very annoying at the same time. This game is plagued with rocket jumping! There are alot of things I hate about this game, too many to list here anyway.
