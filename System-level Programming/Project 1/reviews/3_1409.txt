This is a totally new spin on Quake II. It is different than the computer version, new levels, new missions, but the same new enemies from Quake II on the computer. There are around 16 levels with 30 missions. What I mean by missions, is that in each level you have stuff to do, such as collect explosives, then place them to blow up a power grid, or realign a satellite dish. If this sounds complex, don't worry just walk up to something and it is done (quite brainless). This game is your stereotypical shooting game, you run in a first person game, with one of seven guns you can pick up and with this game you get a full 360 degrees motion with your gun, so its more than shooting straight. With other shooting games you fight against waves of monsters, in this game there are pretty much 10 - 20 creatures per level, making the levels go by quickly. This is a pretty good game, the only real downfall is that there are only 10 - 20 enemies per level, making the game go by pretty quick and easy. However the second to last level is totally different from the previous levels making it nearly impossible for the player to complete (Several death traps when the previous levels have no death traps).
