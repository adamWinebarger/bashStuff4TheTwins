Plodding first-person shooter with tons of fog to conceal thegraphic weaknesses.  One-player missions are tedious.  Only redeemingfeature is to play the two-player game with other "South Park" fans, and then only if you've gotten the codes to unlock favorite characters.
Even with friends, you'll tire of it in a day.
