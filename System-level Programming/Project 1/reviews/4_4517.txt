I've enjoyed StarCraft ever since it came out. I loved it, and even to this day, I enjoy playing it. StarCraft is just one of those games that I've continued playing over the years. It has everything a great game needs: good graphics and sounds, compelling story, well-developed characters, and balanced, interesting units. If you're interested in getting StarCraft 2, but have never played this, do yourself a favor: skip out on StarCraft 2 and buy this instead.

For the most part, I play StarCraft for the single player campaign. Not only is it fun, but the characters actually make you care about them. For me, the characters are the most compelling aspect of the single player campaign.

Gameplay-wise, I can't really say that StarCraft is much of an innovator. Nevertheless, the three races are well balanced and packed with interesting units. There are only two resources, but the resources themselves actually managed to be fairly interesting to me for a while. The single player campaign has well over 40 missions (with StarCraft and BroodWar combined). There are also a few cutscenes for each race.

The voice acting is fantastic. The characters end up being well developed, and like I said before, they make you care about them. The voice actors really made their characters come to life. The unit sounds are also very well done, and are fairly distinct.

As far as video game plots go, StarCraft's is pretty good. There's nothing really amazing in there, but it still manages to be interesting.

The graphics are pretty good; they bring the dark, gritty universe of StarCraft to life.

Good as it is, StarCraft still has its share of problems. For starters, you can only select 12 units at a time. This ends up being fairly irritating, as more often then not, the player will have a large force but will be unable to select all his or her units, which can be a pain if you're in the middle of a large battle. The unit pathing isn't that great, either. The units in StarCraft can't take care of themselves very well. Total Annihilation's pathing is quite a lot better, and you can select more then 12 units at a time.

Those two problems are my only real gripes with StarCraft. The units are interesting, the characters (and voice-acting) are fantastic, and the three races are very well-balanced. There's a reason that StarCraft is one of the most celebrated RTS games of all time; essentially everything about it is almost pure excellence aside from a few issues.
