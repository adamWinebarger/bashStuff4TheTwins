Real official game for just $20! I have the 3DS version of this game so I was curious about the original. I say it's worth the money, unless you feel it's to pricey then just get the 3DS version that's also $20 at Walmart. My only complaint is that it looks a little blurry on my TV. So I suggest if you want the best 64 games Nintendo has to offer, this is definitely a don't miss! I also recommend getting the N64 redesign analog stick, hyper pak plus, and a expansion pak for the best N64 gameplay experience ever!!!
