This is a rather decent fighting game starring DC's premier superhero team. The roster of characters is a bit limited (What! No Green Lantern?) However all the mainstays of the JL are here-Yes,even Aquaman. But the computer A.I. is pretty cheap. It's fursturating to be trying to land one hit, and geting pummeled by the Flash quicker than, well...The Flash. Also, the special moves are rather tough to pull off, and when you do a special you usually have no ideal how you did it. If the game were more balanced, and had more characters to choose from, it would be more interesting. As it stands, it's good, but could have been so much more.
