I just got done playing Duke Nukem: "Land of the babes" and noticed a few reviewers where saying that game was nowhere near as good as Time To Kill or the other title. So after enjoying Land of the Babes, I couldn't wait to get into this one and see what made it so much better? But to my disappointment... what the heck makes it any different or better????

This one here I say is pretty much the same game as Land of the Babes, apart from different stages and a few enemies, only a small amount of guns are different from the other title, but none the less, they could easily have both been part of the exact same game.

Now, I'm not bagging this game, don't get me wrong, but I think it's just as equal to Land of the Babes. Maybe this one stands out a little more because some stages resemble that of Zero Hour on the Nintendo 64, but lets be honest, Zero Hour is a far superior game on every level. Literally.

Maybe Time to Kill requires a bit more searching around to get through levels, that part may be a little bit harder, but in the end, I felt like I had played the same game twice, and was a little bored by the end of it. By the time I blew away the final boss, I expected the ending to be disappointing, and low and behold, possibly the most disappointing ending in Duke Nukem history.

Of coarse, maybe had I been playing this 10 years ago or around the time this game came out, maybe it might have seemed a lot better at the time... but no wait, Zero Hour was made too, and that game rocked my world... but this one here, euhhh, I can see why some might like it better than Land of the Babes, but it's only by a small fraction.

Overall, if you play another DN title on the PS1 before this, you may think either "Ummm, this is the same game" or "Oh, goodie! More levels!".
