This is my favorite game in the Crash Bandicoot series, but there are some things I really, really hate.

First, the graphics are great. This is one of the better looking games on the PS1 in my opinion, and it has aged fairly well.
The sound is excellent. The music is very enjoyable to listen to, and Crash isn't full of the 'tude that most video game mascots in the 90's had.

The gameplay and controls are really nice, however the jumping and spin hover physics can get a little wonky sometimes.

But what really chaps my ass are the non-platforming levels. This game tries to add some variety by including jetskiing, motorcycling, and flying levels. The control in the motorcycle levels is too tight and its hard to make sharp turns. The flying levels are extremely frustrating because the enemy fighters can drain half of your health in one go, and there are a limited number of health powerups.
Thankfully, these are only about 5 total of each of these levels.

This is one of the best Playstation games ever, and I recommend it to all owners.
