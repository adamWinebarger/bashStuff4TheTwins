While there's very little storyline to speak of, VR Missions provides a plethora of challenging objectives that test strategic skills, quick thinking, and patience.  The controls are solid, the missions are varied, and the sense of accomplishment is certainly there.  Graphics and sound are minimalist and serve the game well.  Sure it feels like a small expansion and not a full game, but it's worth a look if you enjoyed the training missions from MGS.  I found the "confidential" image displayed after achieving 100 % completion to be a nice treat, and surprising as well.
