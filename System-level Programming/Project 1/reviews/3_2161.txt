This game is pretty entertaining for the first couple weeks that you have it.  After that is doesn't really have much to offer.  The game just gets really easy to beat and extremely repetitive with all the says of the various characters.  Although the characters, with names like Slippy and Peppy, give some extra flavor to this boring game.  Multiplayer mode is just plain bad.  All of the escape moves make it too easy to dodge your opponents fire, so the game takes forever, and the multiplayer levels themselves offer you nothing interesting.  This game does have it's value for a little while so if you want to try it then rent it, don't waste your money buying it.
