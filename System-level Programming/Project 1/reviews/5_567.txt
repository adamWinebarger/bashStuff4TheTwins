This game is amazing!!! The level design and all the awesome puzzles make this game the best TR game I've ever played!! This one is perfect to start if you are too young and never had a chance to play the Tomb Raider classics from PS1. After playing this one, play #5, then #1,  then #4. Tomb raider...THE BEST SERIES EVER!! (ESPECIALLY THE CLASSICS ONES FROM 1996 - 2000)
