I bought this because my HDTV only had one S-Video/AV input. The rest were HDMI/DVI-Audio/PC/USB inputs. Seeing as though I like to play game consoles such as Dreamcast, N64 & the Wii, I've decided to buy this to hook up such consoles into it. The AV selection works nicely. You just switch and that's it. This device is highly recommended.
