Graphics: 9/10
Very impressive, with smooth animations and the requisite cool lightning effects.
Sound: 8/10
While there's no Street Fighter-style semi-incoherent yells, the sound effects are better than what you see in most fighters and the music isn't too annoying either.
Gameplay: 7/10
If you're new to fighting games, this is a good place to start, with lots of easy combo strings and flashy moves, with enough depth to justify spending a week or two learning the ins and outs of your favorite character. Unfortunately, hardcore fans will be disappointed with the emphasis on uncounterable pokes, double reversals and insane float combos.
Replay: 9/10
Lots of new (actually interesting) modes, and plenty of characters for you to trash a friend with. It's just plain fun playing as a giant bear or breakdancing fighter.
Overall: 8/10 (not an average)
If you're reading this review, you probably don't care about the finer gameplay aspects. Go ahead and buy it, even novices can have lots of fun. If you're experienced with 3D fighters, you'll probably want to buy a Dreamcast instead.
