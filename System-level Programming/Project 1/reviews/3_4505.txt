I bought StarCraft as a Gold Box deal. The price was right but again I have learned the hard way. The nestalgia of playing an older game is tough to get back when the game runs in a much smaller resolution than my current systems. Even a High Resoltion hack doesnt help. It is best to remember the older games and move on.
