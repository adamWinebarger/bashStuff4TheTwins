Spyro the Dragon was the game I got right after it's sequel: Spyro 2 Ripto's Rage. I know it's a bit too late, but I just think that the Spyro series are too fun. Spyro 2 is better than the first, but this game is still great. The graphics and sound is nice, the gameplay will leave you hours into this game, and the story is original. Spyro is one of my favorite series, and this game is great and fun for everyone.
