After passing Gabriel Knight 1 and 2 long before this game came out I was very "into" the gk series, then the third installment came. I was expecting it to be like the first one, cartoonish and not very realistic, I was right. In my opinion, gabriel knight 2 is the best of the series only because the personalities of the characters stand out the most in the gabriel knight series. Gabriel knight 2 uses real actors whom gave a great performance, the use of 3d and going back to Tim Curry in GK3 was going down a step. Gk3 is basically Gk1 in polygonal format with a less interesting backset.
I was very dissapointed in the story of this game, in the end after I confirmed the whole story, i said "nice try". Nice try as in, 'nice try, but the story just doesn't work out'. One thing that makes the GK series good, is gabriel himself. He was protrayed well in this game, because they used Tim Curry as the voice, as they did in GK1. Another character you play in the game is Grace, very frusterating when it comes turn to play her, the game totally changes from fun and comical to extremely boring. In all fairness though, playing Grace is boring in all 3 games.
So to cut things short the only incentive to play thie game is for the 3d graphics, they are indeed nice eye candy. I recommend playing "The Longest Journey", or if you want a taste of the GK series, Gabriel Knight 2 is the way to go.
