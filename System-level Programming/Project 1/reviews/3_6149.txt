This game was kind of disappointing. I am not sure if it was the story line or the characters themselves that did or did not do it for me. Aside from the beautiful cut scenes and graphics this game left me feeling sort of aching to play a good rpg. Which is sad because this is a Final Fantasy game and I should not feel like that after having playing it.
