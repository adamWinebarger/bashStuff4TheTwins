KEEP AWAY UNLESS YOU ARE A FAN OF THE ALIEN SERIES!!!

This game is old, and it shows.  There is no Dual Shock capabilities, and pretty much everything is sprite animation except the walls and doors.  It really looks like it could be a cell phone game.  The story is: there is no story.  You are pointlessly taken on an adventure through the areas of the first three movies in the series (the TRILOGY at the time, obviously) and pit against tons of enemies including human foes as well as the Alien creatures and their varients.  This game isn't very creative, or well designed, but it is classic.  In the end, and as a fan of the Alien series, I must say DO NOT play this game.  It will only alter your perception of the series.
