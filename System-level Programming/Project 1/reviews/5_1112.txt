The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time is really awesome, but how awesome? Is it the best of the Legend of Zelda series so far? Oh, undeniably, but that is not the point. My point is that it was the best game for the Nintendo 64, with Super Mario 64 and its direct sequel, Majora's Mask in a second place draw. It shows how the franchise began. Link sets off on a journey to save Hyrule from the evil Ganondorf for the first time. He meets Princess Zelda on the way, and when she flees from Ganondorf, she leaves the Legendary Ocarina of Time in Link's possession. He uses it to travel through seven years with the help of the Master Sword. The graphics were neat for the time, the storyline was really exciting, and there is a lot of stuff to collect. The dungeons were challenging, and the boss fights are neat. If you are a fan of Nintendo, please pick this up. You will be glad you did.
