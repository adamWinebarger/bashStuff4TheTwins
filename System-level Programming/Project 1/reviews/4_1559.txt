I enjoy playing this game for the most part. I have spent hours glued to the computer watching my cities grow. Unfortunately as the cities increase in population, so does the chances of the computer crashing - a very annoying problem. Also the parades last too long, the seaports are difficult to develop, the terrain for some cities, such as St. Louis, are unusually hilly, and the buildings look alike. The game is not that challenging. But overall a recommended game.
