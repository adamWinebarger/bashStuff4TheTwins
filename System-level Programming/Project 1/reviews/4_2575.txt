This type of RPG was easy to master, because at the start of the game, I chose Bulbasaur for this type of match.  I used him in the first 2 stages of the game, but sometimes the rest of the game.  Whenever you use a fire-type attack on an ice/water type, it will either say "It's super effective" or "It's not very effective"  Otherwise, this game's a blast to play, with 150 different pokemon characters to choose from.  Go buy them both.  You'll need them to link up to Gold/Silver.
