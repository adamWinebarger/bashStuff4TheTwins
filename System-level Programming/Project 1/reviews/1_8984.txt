I bought this game a long time ago when it first came out.  I wish I would have rented it first but I bought it anyway because it had Spiderman and the X-Men in it.  I have to say this game is just weak in all aspects of the game.  The levels are boring and unimaginative and the characters and bosses are dull.  I DON'T recommend this game at all.
