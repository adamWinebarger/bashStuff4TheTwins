This is definitely a fun platformer and a good first attempt at the genre by Naughty Dog.

Graphics (8/10) - The environments look very lush and colorful. From what I've seen, the game has none of the typical warping PS1 games are known for. It still holds up well today.

Sound (6/10) - Mostly average tunes here. Nothing I'd demand to put on my iPod, but it gets the job done and fits the game well.

Gameplay (8/10) - The game controls well even though you have to use the D-pad, since the analog support didn't exist when the game came out. The game itself is a challenging, fast-paced platformer that moves fairly linearly. It's a lot of fun.

Overall (7/10) - This is a solid game by Naughty Dog, and a great start to an awesome series.
