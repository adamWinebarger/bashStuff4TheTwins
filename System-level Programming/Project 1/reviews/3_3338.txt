This is a decent game, but it quite overrated.  The linearness of the early game is strangleing.  The lack of a pause function also hurts the game.  Many of the characters are sorely weaker than the others.  Plus, there are far too many subgames that are annoying that you have to waste lots and lots of time to accomplish something that should be quite simple.  Being able to make all you characters steal or cast great magic (usually from the Enemy-Skill materia) is great, but it kills individuality.
If you need your RPG fix, get it, but be forewarned that it is nowhere near as good as FF6, FF9, or Chrono Trigger.
