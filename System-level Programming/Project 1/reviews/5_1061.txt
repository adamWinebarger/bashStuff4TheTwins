Goldeneye lookes like just another shootem up game, but it is more than that. Goldeneye takes James Bond to the next level.
Pros: graphics are great
4 player is fun
lots of cheats to make the game even better
alot of characters to choose from
Cons: a little to easy to beat
no voices during game play
not alot of multiplayer levels
In the end Goldeneye is a great game and I recommend it to anyone.
