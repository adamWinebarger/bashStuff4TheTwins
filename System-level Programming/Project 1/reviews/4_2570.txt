Let us be honest with ourselves. This is an old game. And yet it rocks most hard, say thankee. It's also highly addictive.

The point of Pokemon is simple: catch cute, little, animated talking monsters with magic, plastic balls, and use them to kick the living daylights out of the cute talking monsters of your enemies. So in truth, it's a lot like real life.

Plus, said monsters are fully changeable. You can give them a name, teach them special fighting skills, and even control how much they grow. This makes them much better than hamsters as pets go.

Plus, its got ninjas! I'm not only talking about a ninja master who uses Pokemon to duel you (I guess he never learned how to use shuriken or swords or stuff), I also mean you can name you Pokemon things like: Mifune or Hayabusa or Zatoichi or Swordsman with an Umbrella (that probably won't fit). Of course, you can also name it Winky-dinky-do, if it do please ya. But I digress.

Yes, Pokemon shows its age among modern video games. But so does Pong. And Pong is still mildly amusing. But without Pong, there'd be no Pokemom. And without Pokemon, there'd be no modern video gamage. And without video games, I'd have to actually face my family, friends and problems, and learn actual skills! So play Pokemon! It's better than Pong, and many other video games. Trust me. I've been there.
