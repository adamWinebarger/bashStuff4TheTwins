First things first.  This game IS fun, and it got two stars for that only.
Diablo 2 was fun for a while.  Not a long while like Neverwinter Nights, but a little while.  I didn't make it too far into the game because I lost track of the plot, and the game itself was far too repetitive.  Every battle seemed to be the same, and it was all too easy.  The battel system was just point and click, and there was no strategy to it at all.  I know, this is just supposed to be a hack and slash, but it fails even at that.
The graphics are moderately good, they are not bad but not real good either.  The sound is good, probably one of the best parts of the game.
If you want a hack and slash to be addicted to for less than a week, this is the way to go.  You'll be back.  If you want a hack and slash to play for a while, may I reccomend any of the Icewind Dale's.  If you want a hack and slash with a real good plot, try Neverwinter Nights.
I do reccomend this game, but don't go wasting your money on it right now, wait until it is in the bargain bin, so's you don't get mad when you end up geting the game and becoming sick of it in three days.
