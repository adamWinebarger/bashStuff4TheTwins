This is an awesome set of deluxe The Legend of Zelda video game guides. The box it came in is just great and I'm so happy they took the time to add to some of the books. While I did have some of these books already, the new and thicker Skyward Sword guide is really top notch.

My only complaint is that the box comes full. I have other guides and Zelda books like the historia book that I can't cram inside it with the others, but that's ok. They need to sell the chest on it's own as I could fill another chest with the Zelda guides I already have.

If you're a big Zelda fan and love the hardcover deluxe guides that they release with each game, this is a great box set and totally worth it!
