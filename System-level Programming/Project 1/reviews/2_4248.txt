With a form-factor nearly identical to the original PlayStation  controllers (but minus the analog sticks of the "Dual Shock"  controller), this controller's obvious benefit is to owners of  "Connectix Virtual Game Station", the PlayStaiton-on-Macintosh  emulator.  It's also handy for arcade-y titles and MacMAME, the emulator of  classic arcade video games.
The one place Gravis makes a change is very  much for the worse -- the four separate directional buttons are replaced by  a single pivoting directional-pad.  As too often happens with designs like  this, the D-pad pushes two switches at once, and ALWAYS comes through as a  diagonal (eg, right + up, when you thought you were just pushing right).  The frequent inability to enter a true right, left, up, or down is annoying  in some games, particularly in navigating the menus of an RPG, and deadly  in others (PSX "Asteroids" is unplayable when rotating your ship  sometimes inadvertantly puts you into hyperspace, since that's what  "up" does).
Also of note is the fact that this controller works  only with games written to use Apple's "InputSprockets".  That's  true of most late 90's / early 2000's games, but not of some earlier titles  ("Descent", which used to be bundled with Mac Performas, comes to  mind), and it's not clear if Sprockets will be supported in the upcoming  Mac OS X.
That said, driver installation is easy and has been hassle-free  on my two iMacs and my iBook.  USB plug-and-play almost always works  without a snap, though I've found it's better to plug it in once the Finder  is up instead of during the boot cycle.
If you play lots of Mac games  (and by the way... HOW?!), this is better than relying on mouse/keyboard  alone, but the D-pad problems are a major aggrivation.
