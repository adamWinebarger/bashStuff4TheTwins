Final Fantasy VII was a revolutionary title to say the least. The game contained several things that wowed gamers everywhere such as beautiful graphic, new battle system(limit break, materia) and actually engaging plot. When I played it in 1997!!, I absolutely loved it and thought that it was one  of the greatest game ever made.

  However, I can't say I should recommend this game to new gamers right now (2006). Once beautiful graphic looks horribly jagged in today's standard (i.e. Cloud's hair) and frankly, battle system is just another japanese rpg battle system (now, gamers are more exposed to Japanese RPG than ever so it doesn't feel so special. In another word, you have seen it before).

  Many aspects of game are outdated and I am not sure new generation of gamers would appreciate Final fantasy VII as we older gamers did. I am sure about one thing though. It is not worth 70 bucks.

  So if you are looking for new solid rpg to play, look elsewhere. A lot of innovations have been made over 10 years and most of it is for better gaming experience. It was a great game in 1997 but you will enjoy other newer rpg more now.
