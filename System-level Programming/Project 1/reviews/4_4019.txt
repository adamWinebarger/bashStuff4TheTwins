Sonic Adventure is one of the most important game's of Sonic's History, being it was the first 3D Sonic the Hedgehog game.
If you recall on the Sega Saturn-
Sonic Xtreme was going to be 3D, but it was cancelled.
Sonic 3D Blast was isometric, not 3D.
Sonic R was 3D, but it was a racing game.
Sonic World was 3D, but it was in Sonic Jam.
Sonic Jame was a compilation of the first 4 sonic games.

The Hub Worlds are amazing, and so are the action fields.
It makes sense to have you complete all the stories to get the final story, It was repeated for a few until 2006. We ALL know what happened then.
The Camera, oh God the camera, I have SO MANY TIMES due to the camera, which is why my rating is 4 stars.
