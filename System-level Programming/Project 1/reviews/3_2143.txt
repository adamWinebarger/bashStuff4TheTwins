Everyone tells me that Starfox 64 has it all: a great story mode, creative bosses, well thought of voice samples, and a fantastic multiplayer experience. Starfox 64 is another classic game on the Nintendo 64. It's designed to be a space shooter, where you fly through levels shooting down enemies and occasionally saving your friends behinds.

Now, never playing this game until very recently, it was hard for me to judge the game based on my opinion. All I've heard about this game is that it is a classic, but when I played it for the first time recently, it was hard for me to consider this game a "classic". The game play was very easy and also very short. I've heard that there are some secret levels, but none that I have discovered yet. During the game you are accompanied by some of your fellow pilots, who constantly need saving. A few times is ok, but in my opinion the creators of this game should have made pilots that knew how to take better care of themselves because there always whining and complaining. Don't get me wrong, this game was really fun; it has great graphics for when it was made, and definitely managed to keep me entertained throughout it. The only problem is that I'm not a valid reviewer because I didn't play it when I was a kid and I have been influenced by the greater technology and systems we have today.

Overall, I rate this game a 3 out of 5 for its graphic appeal, but its lack in greater story mode. I only wish my mom got this game for me as a child.
