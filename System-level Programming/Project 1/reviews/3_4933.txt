Tony Hawks Pro Skater is a fun game.
  PROS:
  1)really fun
  2)levels are huge
  3)2 player mode good
  4)alot of tricks and specials
  CONS:
  1)graphics are choppy
  2)characters are jaggy
  3)controls get difficult in small areas
  4)gameplay gets a little repedative
So if you have a playstation and are looking for a good skating game don't go for Tony Hawks Pro Skater (go for the new ones). It was good for its time but is now old and out dated.
