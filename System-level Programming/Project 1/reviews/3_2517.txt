I loved the game the first time i played it through, but as with MOST (not all) games, it got boring the second time around...:(...It strays far from the movie. It has the basic characters, but is not like the movie. You will recognize a few items and place from the movie...like the palace, of the last part of the game, where you defeat Darth Maul, but it was just kind of a game to sell and make money...It's fun, but doesn't last
