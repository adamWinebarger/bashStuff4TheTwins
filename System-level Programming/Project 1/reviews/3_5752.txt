Plagiarizing makes the video game world go 'round.  Sega had Streets of Rage, Nintendo had Final Fight.  Before that, there was Double Dragon and Renegade.  And that's just one subgenre.  It is perfectly common for a game to be released on the heels of another game, utilizing the same structure, topic, and style of gameplay.  In the case of Carrier, it is obvious that their developers stayed up a lot of nights playing Resident Evil.  But if you're going to rip off a game, at least attempt an improved version, not just a pale knock-off.
This game does nothing better than the Resident Evil series.  The graphics are worse by being so simple (and dark, dark to the point where I had to turn up the brightness on my TV to see necessary objects.)  The premise is twice as hokey as RE's S.T.A.R.S. group.  It isn't nearly as scary as RE.  The long stretches of dialogue exposition in Resident Evil were tolerable because they were interesting and revealed plot points.  Here, they are tediously boring.  RE has minimal backtracking, this has copious amounts of backtracking.  And, most comically, Resident Evil had one of the most cheesy, hokey, unbelievably delivered dialogue of any video game EVER.  So Carrier should have at least got THAT right, huh?  Well, sadly, no.  How Jaleco managed to find voice acting even MORE uninspired, boring, and wooden than RE, I'll never know, but they did.
So that's the story.  Gameplay is a mirror image of Resident Evil.  Same artistic backdrops, same wanky control, same "spooky" atmosphere and gradually revealing storyline.  Just twice as boring and unnecessary.  Especially now that RE2 and RE3 are available on Dreamcast, you might want to make Carrier the last of the "survival horror" titles you obtain for the Dreamcast.
Well, it is better than Blue Stinger.  That's a plus, right?
