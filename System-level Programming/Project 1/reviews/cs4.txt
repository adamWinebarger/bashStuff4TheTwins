I must admit This game hasnt aged too well the N was well known for having the cleanest looking polygons Despite this this game isnt lacking in pure fun and its one of the best multiplayer experiences on the systemI own Rock Band  for Xbox One and I learned that you can add more vocals to tracks  I saw that this was cheaply priced and has a high rate of success from other buyers

though the mic does work and had no problems with utilizing the tambourine my only real complaint is that the USB Cable length is too short when compared to my original Rock Band Mic from RB

I fixed the problem by adding a usb extension cable to each mic  This added an extra  cost per mic and gave me ft  For ft it would have been a  increase and for ft   Even with the extensions youre still looking at a cost savings over the Rock Band mic of Turok  Seeds of Evil has a lot to love about it  The music rocks  The graphics are still quite good for N standards especially if you have the Expansion Pak  It controls just fine get used to the Cbutton controls  Theres some good multiplayer  Its a bloody gory mess  And the weapons are freaking awesome just wait till you see the Cerebral Bore

But theres a big problem with it DESIGN

Im not talking about the art direction or graphical look  Turok  is still a goodlooking game with gruesome enemies and solid lighting effects  But these levels are confusing as all hell with the exception of the st one  If we had a better story to go along with it then maybe thered be a reason to plow through  But for whatever reason Acclaim  Iguana decided to force the player to scour every inch of the  levels and if youre stuck youre stuck for good

You will be required to light beacons find keys and rescue children  Again Level  isnt so bad but Levels  are gonna be a pain in the butt if you get lost  The map youre given sucks  And to make matters worse you cant leave or quit levels once youve selected them

But if youre not too proud to grab a strategy guide or go online then Turok  will be more fun than perhaps some of us had back in   The combat is still a blast although the final Primegen boss is impossible without cheat codes  The presentation is sharp  And the Turok world is still very unique from todays overload of militarywar shooters

Turok  was one of the Ns most criticallyacclaimed titles for the console rightfully so  But be warned itll test your gaming logic more than you expectThis game is really fun but I honestly enjoyed Crash Team Racing for the PlayStation a lot more One thing that annoys me about this game is that you cant look behind you I pressed every button and I cant get the camera to face behind the racer and this makes it impossible to shoot green turtle shells from behind without proper aiming So nine out of ten times Im going to miss my target How did Nintendo screw up this badly And the racers are prerendered much like how Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong were in Donkey Kong Country for the SNES I was wondering why wasnt it computer generated like Super Mario  Its still a nice little game a little pricey but still nice to have in your N collectionThe movie Goldeneye was a boxoffice hit and now it comes to nintendo Every wonder how James Bond found Natalia how Xenia died or how Bond killed Trevalyn Now you get to do it yourself You travel to Siberia to recover blueprints go on a battleship to save hostages launch a space shuttle and shoot all the bad guys you want with over  weapons from Gernades lasers all handguns machine guns and rocket and nuclear bombs Try out the game to see what you would do if you were Bond Heres your chance to be Love this game  So much fun  It is even better with the cheats  One of the best games for the N  I can play this for hours apon hours  I love this gameThis is a musthave for your N  It is fun to play by yourself but the most fun is when you play with  friends    The graphics are not the greatest but it usually doesnt affect the gameplay  A classic N gameI have to be honest Normally Im not into these first person shooter games  Theyre just so clunky most of the time you cant tell where youre going you dont know if an enemy is behind you Or at times even in front of you if you get a weird camera angle and plus might I add that you cant see your character which does not really For me most of the time give that whole imaginative feel that you ARE that character
  Well Goldeneye is an excellent and well made game
  I dont know why people complain about the graphicsits actually kind of cool and plus the enemies in this game are from head to toes so detailed that you think theyre real  The scientists in the facility level are well detailed and most all the characters are animated incredibly
  Besides you take on the role of James Bond  James Bond The hero that defined action This game is not dull and at times it is so scary when you are overswarmed by a bunch of enemies in one small room
  The multiplayer mode is of course wonderful  You can choose from power weapons sniper rifels Dostovals Shotguns PPs proximity mines hand grenades laser guns and basicly everything else that you can think of  It is an entertaining game and it is well worth the money
  The camera angles rock  you never get lost
  So why didnt I give this game Five stars  Read below and find out

  THE BADS OF THE GAME
  There are some major glitches  You can see your enemies literally walk through walls not completely but almost there
  At times the doors when I command it to open with the B button it still wont open even if I already DID get an access card for the door in the first place  The reason behind that is the fact that an enemy is probably trying to open the door as well but how am I supposed to know that So I stand back the enemy comes in and oh guess what it turns out that there isnt just one of them theres thirty so they all shoot at me and I die  You can easily die in this game just due to glitches which makes it very difficult and frustrating
  If you forget one thing on a mission just one small thing which most of the time has nothing to do with the story then you have to start the whole mission over again  You dont just do the thing you forgot either you have to do all the things that you did do as well as the things you did not
  The game is predictible due to the fact that it follows the movie although when it does not follow the movie Which it does a lot then it gets kind of dissapointing because what you expected did not happen
  The puzzles can be frustrating  Im still trying to figure out how to get the bottling room on the facility level
  The game is also very gory  I dont know why they gave this game a TEEN rating instead of a matureit should of been rated mature

  Now for the GOODS of this game
  GOODS
  Use an incredibly large arsenal of weaponry and more weaponryprepare to save the world its gonna be a rough ride
  It follows the movie really well Most of the time anyways And if youre a big fan of james bond you will really enjoy this game  Even if you arent youll still enjoy it
  You play the role of james Bond which is worth it within itself
  This game is the greatest First person shooter game for the N  The controls arent so difficult that youll get lost and forget which buttons to use while youre losing but they are simple and easy and at the same time fun  And even if you dont like the controls you can decide which buttons you want for which ones the controller screen
  Theres nothing that you cant shoot or destroy
  The cheats are FUNNY  I mean honestly try the invisibility mode You can shoot a near bye dashboard when a Gaurd is near and that gaurd will start freaking out and look around to see who did that  This makes the game easier also and the invincibility mode is good too although I tried and realized that you cant have the invisibility mode and invincibility at the same time  You can also make the bad guys heads small and stuff which is really funny to see
  The way that the characters are animated are almost identicle to the characters in the moviethey look exactly like the actors
  At the end of every level it tells you how many kills you did how many limb shots how many head shots and how many body shots you had
  The artificial intelligence with the badguys arent all that challenging but when theres a whole crowd of them watch out
  This game is excellent  Did I mention that its excellent Let me repeat it again This game is excellent Excellent I tell you excellentI got this game because every person said it was the best game ever For  it is but now its just good Not as good as wind waker or twilight princess The level design is good Parts are d others are resident evil camera In short it works okay but I screwed up many times becaus of it the graphics were good several years ago but now they are muddy and polygonal Aside from that its zelda Nothing new If you buy it dont expect it to live up to all the hypeGood graphocs multiplayer mayhem secret levels of which the first is kind of like a part of the movie Moonraker earn this level by beating the game on secret agent and the second of which is where you have to beat Baron Sameidei with the Golden Gun earn this level by beating the game on OOagent The game is not overly gory If you shoot someone a red patch appears on there clothes but it is hard to see on most of the d characters With twenty levels in all and ten or so multiplayer areanas it is no wonder this game was voted game of the year in Nintendo Power magazine The music is excellent and can really get you excited and it can also get you scared The AI is pretty dumb on the agent setting it develops about a fifty percent intelligence upgrade on secret agent setting and on OOagent you had better find some cover The game can take a while to beat if you want to get all the secret levels and secret codes for the game by beating the main game missions in a certain time with all of the objectives met Have and watch outThis mario kart changed all mario karts in the future This is the first mario kart that has mini games and computer generated graphics I mean the  as u can tell the graphics have changed allot from the snes This mario kart has many more features and great graphics The sound is great also If i had a choice of which mario kart to have for free if i did not have any of them it would be this one I dont know why but for some reason this one is really fun It has a great multiplayer especially on mini gamesI liked it and had fun with it played for a while and got my moneys worth  You can certainly go further than I did but I got frustrated with the fact that here we are in this new start and still taking from the earth rather than living with it Better than simcity in that respect and maybe the best we could hope forMario Kart  is one of that games that is hard to find but that effort has a very good reward cuz this is one othat games that began the real player madness you know its also considered as one of the best Mario Kart games ever better than Mario Kart Double Dash and maybe as good as Mario Kart Wii The only thing that I didnt give the  is that this game is a bit tedious Yes I know that graphics forget about the graphics cuz first its the N and second graphics are not important in this game that focus on fun If you have a  and you dont have already MK you must find it now Everybody with a  must have this crazy great game dont forget four controllers for the real madnessGoldeneye has to be one of the best multiplayer games ever  I still play this game against friends even though i have a ps now  The graphics are still ok to look at even though i have seen far better on dc and ps It has excellant replay value and is very challenging to defeat on all difficulty settings  Pick this up if you want the best fps on nWhen I had this game I did not stop playing until I got to winning the game Its fun for awhile to throw objects at people that are racing against you It has a four player mode which is not bad but sometimes gets a little confusing when youre watching other people racing The split screen should never be included Although that it is which is easy to get distracted But Mario Kart is fun and it should be in one of the handheld games too I wouldnt mind playing this Oh I have the one on Gameboy Advance which is cool but not like the one from Nintendo  Now that confused meThis was a great replacement mic for RockBand We always had a hard time with the tapping portion of the game with OEM This picked up the taps perfectly for that  score while singing More cowbell anyoneId recommend buying it used to save some money  The tracks are nice and the game play is all right  Its just not the same as playstation racing games thoughMario Kart   It is such an improvement from the Super Nintendo version  The graphics are quite detailed in comparison to the other  games out  I would say above average  However the graphics is not what sets this game off above the others  It is the enjoyment level
Not only is it fun to compete with others like your family friends or even the computer player AI but its got a great Grand Prix mode in which you can compete for a Gold Cup  Get all gold Cups and you gain a bonus
The only complaint I have about this game reason why I gave it a four instead of a  is that the AI are too smart  Races sometimes seem to be unfair  You throw items at them knock them to the side speed ahead of them and it seems like whatever you do it doesnt matter  This can be frustrating  Though the controls are WAY improved over the Super Nintendo version it still is hard to control the carts karts around corners
Overall this is an addicting game
Have a Super Nintendo Buy Mario Kart for Super Nintendo
Have a Gamecube Definetely buy Mario Kart Double Dash for Gamecube
And finally if you have a N Mario Kart  is one to deeply considerThis game is defanitly worth the time and moneyYou can choose from either mario grand prixVSbattleor time trial

 In mario grand prix you choose from a wide selection of characters wich one you want to be You Can pick from four different cupseach with four different race tracks Then its time to race as you play against the  other characters Up to  people can play mario grand prix
 In VSyou play against one computer character or  family members or friends You can choose any course is the game Up to  can play VS

 In the battle mode up to four can play You get  balloons and the other players try to pop them The last one standing wins Up to  can play battle mode
 Finallyin time trial only one person plays You can choose any courseyou try to make a good time and if you wantyou can try to beat it Only one player can do time trial

 Mario Kart is a Great game and if you have a NGET ITI got this game in  and it is still fun to play Unlike the original Mario Kart for the SNES or the new Mario Kart Super Circuit for the GBA both of these games you have to use a control pad to driveyou can use the control stick on the N controller ot drive your gokart which is a hundred times easier than a control pad The game is easy in the begining but it hets much harder as you get closer to finishing it The graphics are spectacular and so is the music In one course you can go off roading and drive around and look at Princess Toadstools castle form Super Mario  The tracks are cleverly designed and all to often youll find yourselft barely winning or completing a race The game does offer a good challenge with eight drivers to choose from which onclude the following and their speed Mario average Luigi average Peach average Toad fast Yoshi fast Donkey Kong slow Wario slow Bowser slow The speeds come to play in the later levels where only Toad and Yoshi are your best bet for first place Again with the GBA and the Gamecube which launched today as I am writing this Mario Kart  is a must have for N owners who cant get the Gamecube or the GBA for now Also each character has his or her own course and the game has race and battle multiplayer modes where in the battle mode each racer has three balloons arround his or her gokart and everyone has to try to knock out everyones balloons Have funAhhhh I love this game Its so great My friend gave it to me and I fell in love with it fast I played Mario Kart for the SNES and thought it was the best thing since sliced bread When I found out Mario Kart was for N I went bezerk This was the first game to my N collection You choose between  characters You can get over  different powerups including the legendary star which makes you invincible banana peels which make opponents skid out of control lightning bolts which makes characters small so you can smush them mushrooms that boost your engine and  kinds of shells A green shell will go and bounce off anything A red shell will do its best to find a character and smash them and a spike shell with automatically find the player in st place and destroy them without fault The reason it is  stars is because they didnt go the extra mile If you play  or  players you can do a Grand Prix but not with  or  In player  mode you cant do a battle or do a vs with the CPU Battle only contains  tracks I guess what im trying to say is that i wish it was more open Taking shortcuts wont work because Lukita drags you back when your at the top of the mountain This game would be the best if you were allowed to do moreGraphics   Eyecatching bold and pretty Mario Kart s graphics are fulfilling and nice to look at
Sound   Lots of bells whistles engines and dadas in this game They are just small sound but bring out some sort of livelihood
Value   Even though I dont have a Nintendo  if I did I would probably buy this game because it is lots of fun to play It can also be very strategic at times which is good for a racing car game
Overall   Nothing too memorable but its delightfully entertaining to play when you are actually using the controls Mario Kart  gives you things to do and stuff to work out Its the first game I played on Nintendo  and as far as Im concerned its well worth the timeWhen I first heard of a Mario Kart game comming out for Nintendo  I was overjoyed to realize that they would keep up on such an awesome Super  Nintendo game  To my amazment the game came to the  with nothing but  crisp graphics and prerendered characters abound  However where there  comes the good side of all this there is a bad side some of the  characters in the game in fact cheat to win  Now Im not sure why this  little feature was allowed perhaps to make it more challenging or give us  more reason to throw the controller at the wall when Mario suddenly jumps  out in front of you  However you can master there cheating ways by  learning how to outwit them at their own game  Find shortcuts and other  things that can aid you in your race for the finish  From cheating to  graphics and music I must say that the graphics are quite impressive for  such a game made so early on  The music is also amazing with hummable  tunes that will get you in the mood to race or the mood to hit Wario off  the side of a moutain just to here him scream  The sure thing to do now is  to buy the game because it is a classic and always will beGreat game but Perfect Dark is WAY better If you really like Bond or you can find this game cheap somewhere you might want to pick it up but if youre just looking for a good first person shooter or multiplayer game skip it and get Perfect Dark insteadThere isnt much you can say that is bad with this game For its time it  had excellent graphics excellent game play and sound This game is truly one in a million that I am sure any person can enjoy BUT if your a Zelda fan and have played all if not most games from the beginning youll notice some of the things in OOT are recycled For example the Kakariko town music is completely recycled from Zelda A Link to the Past In fact this game borrows a lot from Zelda A Link to the Past though they do manage to change some things in OOT here and there Still for what its worth Zelda OOT is still a pretty darn good game though I think the story should have been more originalWorks well for the most part there has been two times were it was making this static noise but once we unplugged it and then replugged it in is had been okI got this on the GameCube Collectors edition and really its confusing how they DIDNT make this the best game of    and  They DID make it the best game of  and  but anyways theres a master quest version out there for GameCube The sites are beautiful And when u get inside the Deku Tree let the actionfantasy beginthe game was awesome Zelda has always been an addicting mindblowing and fun game Many people like it The game features a great d world in which there is night and day the game also has many different enemies and dungeons and the famous ocarina where you can play different tunes that you have learned A really good game if you like action and adventure The frustrating thing are the puzzles they may take some time to solve This is not why i gave the game  stars I believe  stars means the game is perfect and this game is not perfect Stars because they like it and play it often enough so dont feel like money is wasted I got them one each so they can multiplay with each otherA Good game comes along entertaining millions of fans worldwide Then a year later another good game comes along and steals the fisrt ones place Ever since the beginning of game history every good game that came out eventually got replaced by a better game the next year Since Sept  that cycle has been broken stopped by one game that never got replaced even by its sequals nothing ever ended out better than Zelda Ovarina of Time This game has revolutionized D gaming with its ZTarget system It has enchanted and bewildered people with its magnificant storyline It has taken the lives of thousands of people because of all the sidequests and collectible items in it This game I am predicting will probably still rain supreme until the next system comes out The one after gamecube Its ZTargeting system makes Link the main character look at an enemy within this looking he can circle around it in stategic patterns accurately aim and strike the sword without missing and hitting air a yard away and eaily and quickly dodge and backflip attacks Many games even nowadays imitate this system but fail to get it as correct and perfect as Zelda diddoes The storyline starts off telling of a magical forest with many nevergrowing children in it All these children have one compainon fairy with them except one boy who does not Right from hearing this setence in the game for the first time you know your in for an adventurous complicated yet slightly realistic storyline that will take your life for at least a month And this game has many many side quests to do There are  special spiders to defeat and get treasures with  magic beans to be planted and give a passegeway to unaccesible areas  heart pecies to collect to get a whole lot of health with  masks to sell and play around with  empty bottles to collect a chicken to rais and a huge trading sidequest that eventually leads to the possesion of the strongest weapon in the game And much more This game also has the perfect sound to it The cheerfull happy nature of the magical forest can be perfectly heard in its background music The adventurous wide and far meadows of hyrule feild are perfectly expressed in its background song The fastpaced and actionpacked lives of the desert theives is clearly expressed in its song Everywhere you turn in this game you are greeted with a new background song that sings perfectly the attributes and unique features of that place and transations perfectly with whatever the playerlink might be doing in that place This games sequal Majoras Mask suffered horribly from the lack of this And the prevous games in the series didnt meet this either One more thing though Ill admit it to the world I hate the main Zelda theme Im glad its not in Ocarina of Time In a game that so clearly stands out with its music one old sounding bland song that dosnt fir well with hyrule feild wouvdv ruined the experience of going out of kokiri forest and seeing it for the first time Oh I forot to mention that part too the game has a perfect attidude for adventure in it The places are designed very well and when mixed in with the fabulous background music gives a feeling of adventure that is completely unparelled to any other game whatsoever The first moment you walk out of the small and cramped kokiri forest which actually used to seem so big onto the your first grasses of hyrule feild the sun will blind the screen for a moment and as rising reveal this spectacular wide open feild with a tuft of trees a monstor here and there a ranch in the middle and a clear blue sky with a brightly shining sun Along the feild a rise in elevation starts as you climb the hill you can see even more than you could before a magestic huge catsle a winding clear blue river a deep valley a menancing volcanoe and a huge lake along with a tuft of trees and a monstor here and there As you travel to new places you will feel almost the exact same feeling of adventure too when seeing the towering windmill of Kakariko village above the small humble houses of the village below it with the perfect backgrond music for example With this great feeling of adventure huge enviroments much huger than even the ones of nowaday games and a great storyline and absolutly stunning soundtrack Ocarina of Time is the Greatest game of all time until a greater game will come out wich will probably take a very very long time If you dont already own this game Shame on you you should buy it immediatly and while waiting for it to ship download an emulated version Now Or elseThis is still a great game to own especialy if you missed it but the graphics are dated  If you have a GameCube find a way to get it on there and be happy you didWorks better than the rockband one Although it might be because my rockband mic is as old as the second rockbandI was always a fan of Zelda when it first came out for the original Nintendo  This is a fairly challenging game and I got bored with it quickly  There isnt a lot of violence in this game but I think its too advanced for kids to playIm not really a fan of N  Ive always been more of a Playstation one fanatic but Zelda is undoubtedly the best game that I have ever played  If you think that Final Fantasy is good then Zelda will make all of the installments in final fantasy look like junk  Theres only a couple of games on the nintendo N console that of which I liked and that was Gauntlet Legends Super Mario and Donkey Kong  But this game beats them all by a longshot
  Then why did I give this game four stars instead of five  The reason is because of theproblems listed below
    This game is HARD I dont mean hard as in Challenging Im talkin about the whole youpossiblywillneverevercompletethegamewithoutastrategyguide hard  The type of frustration which can rack your nerves big time
    There are a couple of glitches in the game Example I dare you to cut a sign with your sword  Then play Zeldas lullaby with your ocerina of time  The piece of sign which you had just sliced and diced will float  Thats just one of the glitches
    A little confusing as far as the story goes  Its better to play the game twice and see if you still understand it
    Replay value isnt very high  Once you complete it thats it  Its so hard that I wouldnt ever want to go through the same frustration again as to the fact that it was very difficult even if you do know what youre doing
  Okay those were the bads  Here are the goods
    The graphics are outstanding  Wow  The whole world of Termina reminds me of middle earth only a lot less dark and ten times more exotic
    Once you beat the game you feel satisfied with yourself  Sure this game is a little short but it will still take you a long time to beat it no matter how experienced you are with gaming
   The plot is good and twists a lot  I know that I said it was kind of confusing and it kind of is but its still fun and the things that of which I did understood surprised me a lot
Its sort of a mystery
    Fluint and absolutely excellent cut and FMW sequences  Its true  Like I said above the graphics are wonderful  And plus exploring a small portion of Termina which you do through out the game is an experience that you dont wanna miss
    The bad guys are challenging but not so challenging that youll be ripping your hair out  Once you beat them you feel satisfied
    Highly addictive gameplay and plus you wont stop until you beat the game
  But theres one major and I mean MAJOR problem with this game  This game is so addictiive that you might forget about everything else in life  Remember your family  You wont when you get this game since youl be wanting to play this game even more A Anyways get the gameZelda occarina of time is much like the rest of the Zelda series it doesnt disappoint With really cool items to collect and using your songsspells to warp around the entire game offers whole new dimensions
Things such as a horse you can call and run about the world play carnivallike games to win powerups collect hardtofind items such as the twohanded sword which is better than the master sword but you cant use a shield magically powered arrows and more
This game is fairly easy to beat but finding everything will take you much longerThis game was a tad on the easy side for the most part but it was still great fun One of the best Zelda games Cool places to explore and neat items to findThis is overall one of the best Zelda games to date It has lush environments and crisp sound effects and music And the controls are super  You have great control over link and the camera The weapon system is good  as well The story line leaves something to be desired though It is a very  basic story Ganondorf kidnaps Zelda Link tries to save her by going to  the future THATS IT There are very few twists in the plot if any that  I can remember Also The game was way too short I bought the game around  Thanksgiving and had it beaten by the nd or rd week of December But  putting those negatives aside this is one hell of a game Oh yeah the  Water Temple is TORTURE Fans of dedicated singleplayer first person shooter games whove never played this game before should definitely not pass it up  HL takes an utterly unoriginal idea for either games or movies and crafts an utterly unstoppable gaming experience  You play Gordon Freeman who works in the bowels of an ultrasecret underground research facility called The Black Mesa  Having played the game yet Im still not sure whats supposed to be going on in BM  its what happens that matters  Oozing hightech the facility is host to another dimension when youFreeman accidentallydo something that tears a whole in the fabric of our own  allowing beings from that other world to enter ours

Now if you think that these otherworldly denizens are peaceful beings intent on fostering crossdimensional love or that your fellow human beings will enter the Black Mesa unarmed intent on warmly welcoming these beings to our world Im afraid youve picked up the wrong game entirely  For in the bowels of Black Mesa youll confront howling dog things flying crabs alienzombified versions of your colleagues gigantic aliens that breathe fire through their fists aliens that hang from ceilings and entrap their victims using these vinelooking things and squads of human special forces troops intent on killing everything that moves  If the above attracts you because you think it may be the setting that elevates the nobility of the human existence I should warn you to look elsewhere  for in Half Life youll find yourself acting indiscriminately with a mm automatic a submachine gun grenades and most regrettably of all a nasty crowbar youll make few friends and find yourself for the most part alone and not infrequently exiled to ventilation ducts again with the ducts to avoid getting shot at by humans or burned bitten bolted or tonguebathed by aliens  Complex problem solving skills as much as marksmanship or bulletsaving are crucial in this game  in which your enemies have aboveaverage levels of AI  There are unfortunately times when a level may be hung up by the failure to achieve some specific missiongoal but this is on the whole a game in which the goals are sufficiently complex to make you feel cool for achieving them yet not so complex as to be impossible to solve  The settings are fantastic  from the vast to claustrophobic  The game is long  uncommitted gamers may find it tedious  but the scope of design here rewards those who keep up with it

I ran this game on an XPequipped P with a MB AGP card and had no problems other than those involving the evil aliens and homicidal fellow humans  Graphics and sound were smooth and I suffered no CTDsAlright already Its a great game Good AI graphics Runs well Atmospheric Great story and dialogue Comedy Blah blah blah
Wait a minute I got a complaint That movie in the beginning You cant escape  it It just goes on and on babbling while youre stuck in a stupid tram  car Sheesh What a bore That kind of nonsense will cost you a star  Later I went thru that ride a few times because I grew to like the eerie  understated music Still I think I should have been able to skip the intro  movie Ruined the whole game for meThis game is definitely a hundred steps past Quake and others of its type The AI is great The evolving story is great The fight against the Special Forces team is nerve wrackingly great However all this greatness became  stale I never bothered to finish the game The game just seemed to grow  old after a time Maybe it needs something more to carry the player  throughGot here faster than I expected Works great that nostalgia kicked in and its just so wonderful Not sure if it was noted before that there was a slight crack in the case But nonetheless awesomeThis is my favorite game in the Crash Bandicoot series but there are some things I really really hate

First the graphics are great This is one of the better looking games on the PS in my opinion and it has aged fairly well
The sound is excellent The music is very enjoyable to listen to and Crash isnt full of the tude that most video game mascots in the s had

The gameplay and controls are really nice however the jumping and spin hover physics can get a little wonky sometimes

But what really chaps my ass are the nonplatforming levels This game tries to add some variety by including jetskiing motorcycling and flying levels The control in the motorcycle levels is too tight and its hard to make sharp turns The flying levels are extremely frustrating because the enemy fighters can drain half of your health in one go and there are a limited number of health powerups
Thankfully these are only about  total of each of these levels

This is one of the best Playstation games ever and I recommend it to all ownersI used to play this game with my grandma This is my favorite in the crash series and its exactly how I remember it No complaints Fast deliveryI had purchased quite a few games trying to find the one I remember This game is fun and has a good roster of  characters The moves are simple and the game is fun hours on end A good way to relax after a tiring dayI am shocked and very pleased to report that Crash Bandicoot  Warped is a DRASTIC improvement over the original Crash Bandicoot

As you may have heard I am definitely NOT a fan of the very first Crash Bandicoot game released for the Sony Playstation in   I am however incredibly surprised to find that Crash Bandicoot  Warped is actually a really fun adventure game that may have been slightly overlooked at the time of its release because of the seemingly neverending amount of wonderful games released for the Playstation in 

Just so you know I cant compare Warped to Crash Bandicoot  Cortex Strikes Back because I havent played that one  I can only compare Warped to the original Crash Bandicoot

Before playing Crash  I was almost CERTAIN that Crash Bandicoot was an overrated video game character because my first and only exposure to Crash was the very first game  I thought for sure Crash Bandicoot was either a Mario or an Earthworm Jim ripoff and didnt deserve all the attention it got

For  years the original was the only Crash Bandicoot game I knew and truth be told it was a pretty average game because every stage featured basically the same uninspiring repetitive island environment where the object was to run to the end of every stage collecting berries and smashing all the boxes as a way to earn more lives and receive a better overall percentage

Simply put Crashs very first outing was BORING  It desperately needed variety  Walking through islandjungle stages all the time can only provide so much fun before it inevitably gets boring  The creators of Crash Bandicoot must have realized how boring this formula was because Warped does just the opposite Warped features nothing BUT creativity  In Warped every stage certainly does NOT have the same feel  You will encounter something drastically different in every stage  I like that

The main objective of Crash Bandicoot  Warped is to find the purple gem found in each of the  stages of the game  You HAVE to find all  purple gems otherwise the game wont allow you to fight the boss at the end of the world youre in  For example if youre in World  and cant find the purple gem in stage  you wont be allowed to face the boss at the end of that world  Youre stuck there until you find that darn purple gem  Once you find the gem and face and defeat the boss you move on to the next world and repeat the process of collecting one purple gem per level and face the boss  By the way theres  worlds total and  stages in each world  That comes to  stages total

The amount of creativity that went into each of the  stages is simply incredible  Unlike the first Crash Bandicoot game where you mainly just spin around through a jungle environment breaking boxes and jumping over cracks in the ground Warped offers a LOT more in the way of variety  In Warped you will encounter a few motorcycle racing stages where youre required to get first place so you can receive the purple gem a couple underwater stages with VERY neatlooking backgrounds and deadly puffy fish swimming about a couple levels where youre steering an airplane and required to shoot down blimps and other airplanes and not to mention those tricky tigerriding stages

Oh and I HAVE to mention the ultracool futuristic robot stages which require nearperfect jumping patterns in order to complete  The Jet Ski stages are really fun because youre located on top of the ocean and I guarantee you will have the time of your life jumping over ramps while avoiding those floating bombs  Yup its awesome  This is what makes Crash Bandicoot  so great you wont know WHAT to expect until you enter the level

Probably the worst thing about Crash Bandicoot  Warped is the fact that the game offers little in the way of challenge  Thats not to say the game is a cakewalk either  People who think Warped is an easy game are only comparing the challenge to the previous two Crash Bandicoot games  If you compare Warped to say I dont know Spyro the Dragon its not such an easy game then  Its definitely not a hard game either  You WILL beat it  I think the challange is comparable to Super Mario Bros  the old NES classic

The one thing I find challenging in Warped is the boss battle in World  where youre required to jump over bombs and laser beams heading in your direction  This is one case where practice doesnt necessarily make perfect  Also the second airplane stage can be a challenge if you dont bother shooting down the enemy planes

One thing about Crash Bandicoot  Warped that IS incredibly easy is the object of finding those purple gems  Most of the time you can NOT miss those gems because you basically walk right into them on your way to reaching the end of the stage  I mean they are always RIGHT THERE  RIGHT in front of you

After you complete a stage you can always go back to it and the computer will then give you a new option to complete the level in a certain amount of time  Finishing the stage in a certain amount of time is actually quite hard  It means you really have to take off running and not stop for a single moment to smash a box or spinattack an enemy or ANYTHING  It means you have to run run RUN  Just so you know completing the stages under a certain time is NOT a requirement  Its entirely up to you if youd like to accept the challenge  Im too much of a wimp to accept it personally

I like how you can save your game after you complete a stage  You can actually complete one stage and go to the save room if you wish  Very convenient  Oh and get this if during the middle of the game you decide you want to stop playing and shut off the Playstation when you come back to the game later all the lives you collected up to that point will STILL be there  I cant think of any other game that will save all the lives you collect  Speaking of lives they are so easy to find in Warped that you probably can collect up to  of them  Thats a lot and you will probably need them because even though the challenge ranges from low to medium your first time through the game wont be THAT simple

When Crash gets hit or smashed by something I think its funny the way he yells whoa  It reminds me of that comedian Carrot Top

The reason Crash Bandicoot  Warped isnt going to receive a star rating from me is because of the same problem found in Spyro the Dragon in the flying stages in this case the airplane stages when you hit down on the Dpad the airplane flies UP and hitting up will make the airplane go DOWN  The game company made the direction the wrong way  Oops  At least when you steer the airplane left it will go left  The same with right  Unfortunately many game makers have made and continue to make the same mistake  It needs to be corrected once and for all

I realize having your airplane fly up when you hit down on the dpad is an example of realism since thats more or less how REAL airplanes operate but the thing is Crash Bandicoot isnt supposed to be about realism since its just a platform adventure game and furthermore it still doesnt change the fact that up and down are reversed  This adds unncessary frustration and challenge in learning something that definitely feels backwards

Theres a toxic underwater stage in Donkey Kong Country  where the controls are reversed as a way to add challenge and in my mind at least having the controls reversed when trying to operate the airplane in this game definitely falls under the same category of unnecessary challenge

I hope you buy this game for your Sony Playstation and experience a fun timeCrash Bandicoot Warped  Orange cool creative fuzzy neat great graphics awesome design introduction of secret levels for the series powerups new bosses including a big boss and a new playable character  These things are what make this a major improvement on the two previous games  Crash  was a breakthrough Crash  opened up a new world and this game completely blows it all away  This was how I got hooked on Crash Bandicoot  I played this and loved it  I recommend itI should probably review some modern games while Im here but Ive been kinda GTAed out recently so I decided to put the PS away for a minute and bring up some old games from the past to see if theyre just as fun as I remember them as  One of those titles was WCWnWo Revenge

Released during WCWs heyday and roughly a few months before WCWs eventual downfall the game showcases an astoundingly deep roster for game that came out in the s  A total of  WCWnWo wrestlers were divided up into different factions  WCW  mainevent wrestlers WCW  midcard wrestlers WCW  opening match wrestlers WCW  Cruiserweight wrestlers nWo White nWo Red and Ravens Flock  Further there were roughly a dozen or so other wrestlers listed under the imaginary EWF and DAW leagues included in the game these wrestlers were modeled after Japanese wrestling stars but had their likenesses changed to avoid copyright issues

The controls of the match are simple enough for anyone to jump in and learn but you have to understand the psychology of wrestling and use the controls accordingly if you want to go deep into the championship modes of the game  Players use the B button to strike A button to initiate a grapple the dpad to move and the joystick to either taunt or execute a special move  The player can differentiate between a weak strikegrapple and a strong strikegrapple by holding the respective button down until the move is executed  The more worn down your opponent is the better chances you have of successfully hitting them with a strong attack  Yet if you try to initiate a strong grapple on an opponent whos not worn down theyll likely reverse the attack and counter with one of their own  So much like real wrestling you have to wear your opponent down with the weak attacks until you move up and hit them with the strong ones and also like wrestling its a good idea to generate a response from the audience by letting out a taunt while your opponents down  Once your spirit meter is full you can strike an opponent with a special move by initiating a strong grapple and then moving the joystick or alternately using the joystick when on the turnbuckle if the finishers an aerial maneuver  The controls also allow you to run leave the ring blockcounter an attack dodge an attack and set your focus on another opponent if youre involved in a handicap or tag team scenario

The game has several modes  Championship Exhibition and Special Modes  The exhibition mode is a singles or tag team match where the player can face either the computer a friend or a few friends since the game supports up to  players  The championship modes allow the player to compete for the WCW TV Championship the WCW Cruiserweight Championship the WCW Tag Team Championship the WCW United States Championship and the granddaddy of them all the WCW World Heavyweight Championship affectionately referred to as the Big Gold Belt  While the path to the Television titles and the Cruiserweight titles arent terribly challenging you will need to bring your A game when competing for the highertiered titles or you can dial the difficulty down to Easy either or  The special modes essentially allow the player to engage in specialty handicap or battle royal exhibition matches with the former allowing for on or on battles while the latter will have  competitors fighting each other in the ring until ones eliminated with the option to allow up to  contestants to enter the match  Youre also given a mode where you can customize the given wrestlers to either have different names or to have them wear different costumes

The upside to the game is that its still fun to play even  years later  As I said earlier anyone can pick up the controllers and jump in while the subtle nuances of the game dont take much effort to figure out as you go along  The soundtrack is limited but I dont ever think anyone confused WCWs entrance music with the music that Jim Johnston of WWE fame has released over the years with the only exception being Goldbergs theme  The graphics were a work in progress considering where the franchise was at by the time WWF No Mercy was released but it was still leaps and bounds better than what most expected from the gameplay of other systems at the time as a reminder this game was released for a console that is three generations removed from whats available today  If there was one drawback from the game its the limited gaming options that exist  Once you beat the championship mode that was essentially it as far as beating the game was concerned  There were no steel cage match options tag teams were limited to on action and the createawrestler option wouldnt be introduced until THQAKI began releasing titles for WWF  Other gripes I have are that you cant seemingly control whether or not someone interferes on your behalf and the fact that the CPU can Hulk up their spirit meter rather effortlessly while the player has to do all the little things right to make that possible

With all that said however the games fun factor makes it a legitimate must have for wrestling fans and should be considered by N fans who are looking for a beatemup buttonmasher where the top prize is the WCW Championship  I recommend this to N gaming fans wrestling fans and people who watched wrestling when it was coolAfter passing the second and then the first I was attempted to do this one The graphics are much better than the previous two but the story got very boring The adventures too became very uninteresting Regarding saving and hidden place this one is by far the simplest
The story here continues from where it ended in the last part if you have won that is As oppose to akuaku we see the evil ukauka who is the Big boss of Dr Cortex And we see that Crash is forced to fight them Why Why to save the world of course
In the previous  parts we had gems Now this was not enough for the overactive designers They introduce trophies in this new part For a trophy you have to finish a level within an allotted time This is not that difficult but you cannot achieve it in every levels Some levels are extremely difficult to finish fast I picked all the gems and all but on trophy and imagine my frustration
If you are a crash fan you might like this one but you cannot help being disappointedI always hated the WCW I was playing Warzone Attitude and WWF titles for a long time Then I somehow ended up owning this game and I inteneded to dissmiss it but I found myself playing it more and more every day and eventualy loved it I was happy to hear THQ got the rights to WWF and went from this to Wrestlmania and then the best game on the  NO MERCY However this is the foundation of where it started and I respect it for that It brought a lot of awsome memorys and entertainment on hot summer nights I recomend No Mercy over this but this original version deserves your respectOnce again Crash Bandicoot takes a big step up to greatness Crash Bandicoot  WARPED was fantastic It was even better than the second one Better graphics story music and gameplay The enemies were fun just like in the first one and the new vehicles available were awesome like the biplanes space fighter Pura the Tiger and the jetski Also it wasnt as difficult to gather the Crystals and Gems as it was in the second part The environments were better and the new powers that Crash Bandicoot acquires are totally awesome the Super BellyFlop Speed Shoes DeathTornado Spin Attack and the totally awesome Fruit Bazooka This is definitely one of the best of the games in the Crash Bandicoot Trilogy You Crash fans MUST get this gameThis is a more than ok game Not the bestbut good If you like the Spyro seriesyoull like this for sure The gameplay controlsoundetc are all like the first  The only problem is its EASYReallyreally easy The levels are about  minutes long eachand the total gameplay span is about  hours But still thats better than it being hard Its still pretty fun and stays true to the first  And Crashs little sister premires in it Heres the review

Pros
Brought violence and profanity in videogames to a whole new level
Very good sound effects
long enjoyable levels and misions
A short but destructable arsenoal
Very useful cheat codesDespit I usally dont cheat
Pretty good music
Cons
The graphics are plain out horrible
one shot deathA bit too realisticwell unless you have armor
Cant save until you beat a level
definitly not for kids
The game suffers from slowdowns if too many things are on the screen
In  this game was jst a instant classic despite being overshadowed by loads of gamesespecially Metal Gear Solid and ZeldaOcorina of time  Its definitly unknown since GTA  and Vice City overshadowed it by a loooong mile but yet I still play this game from time to time  In this game you could even say  the police and let them eat the gat take out a squad of them with a machine gun blaze them up with a flame thrower or just blow them away with almighty rocket launcherThat was propably the main reason this game got a lot of heat form contaversy  If youre used to GTA  or Vice City then this game will hardly be interesting to you but if you have this game then Im sure you appreciate the joy the classic burng to you and took you on the crazy ride from this all the way to vice city
Final WordsSpeaking of Vice City That was one of the levels in this game and so was liberty City and San Anderess is the last city  Could San Andress be the next Grand Theft Auto  Hmmmm
peaceThe original Grand Theft Auto was a classic for the PC but its gleefully unabashed violence simple graphics dark humor and addictive gameplay garnered the game much appeal and controversy  Eventually Take  Interactive now theyre called Rockstar published GTA on as many systems as it could the PS Dreamcast and even the Game Boy Color  These days anyone and everyone are GTA nuts but only when it comes to GTA  or Vice City  The original GTA may seem simple enough but it is undeniably fun for the most part no matter how simplistic the graphics seem  The missions can get rather tedious and the fact you cant save your progress in game a problem which would be corrected in GTA  and eventually youll lose interest but for the most part the original GTA is still loads of fun  Those who have only played GTA  or Vice City will not like this original installment but its a great ride while it lastsThe game came in good shape not great but good Still satisfied with my purchase though Does work great just not a collectors choice Not worth sending back  for the flaws it has but am only going to rate it  stars It said like new condition but was not quite like that when received Was packaged well but did not say fragile handle with care on it like others I have ordered Still one of the best games of all times thoughSurprisingly I never got a chance to play the original on the computer but the N version seems to portray the insanity well As I understand it the weapons enemies and level textures are the same but the actual level designs are Nexclusive which is a neat touch Much like the first Quake its not a thinking mans shooter like Perfect Dark or GoldenEye but there are some surprising elements such as the enemies that take potshots at you in their death throes And while theres no online component it offers a commendable splitscreen experience

The N did well with shooters and Quake II is a solid addition to the library My only real gripe is with the series itself from this point on we lost the moody Gothic feel of the original for something much more scifi Still that may not matter when the enemies come tearing into youWhile the product is what it is described as it unfortunately will give me no signal whatsoever I believe it is a fault of the av cable side as plugging that in unplugging it blowing on it hissing at it calling it names then plugging it back in seems to make it work again I did check and have the problem across more than one tv so its not the tvs fault I have no way to determine with confidence if it is a fault of the Wii but I doubt so as the Wii has no problem with its standard definition cabling that it came with why Wii did you not include componenthdmi cabling by default HD isnt that rare Ah but it is the most inexpensive version of this cable I could find and the picture is markedly better using this than the original cablingAmazing game Somewhat easy with a rather sharp difficulty spike at the end but overall enjoyablethis is wat made me love mario mario 

this is the biggest game crammed into a cartridge ive seen its musically awesome graphically it shows age and the camera isnt as good as it could be but I still havent beaten it since then thats how massive  how much gameplay there is to it

I remember sliding down caves  smashing boulders back in the day now that a friend sold it to me Im in love with itmario was always kind if a hard game for me i unlocked a lot of stars but a lot of the game went unlocked i never did beat the whole thing there are some cheats you can look up online for this gameBetter than TR for sure It has some brain taxing levels filled with puzzles secrets and some enemies Im glad to see they have cut back on the enemies and focused on the puzzles and scenery They have definatly picked some good locations for the game with brilliant details that are authentic in style Unfortunatly that is where the authenticity ends
  The level makers should have done some research on these locations and made them more like they are in real life OK I know its an adventure game that is meant to be fantasy but I do feel they could have checked things out first
  Examples India dosnt have pyrannasBrazil does the Ganges dosnt end in a pond St Pauls Cathedral looks nothing like thatthat must be the worst rendition of it yet the British Museum is not next to the Lloyds building and Area  is more spacious than thatI saw it on a TV programme I swear I wont judge the Pacific levels though I dont know enough about them They realy do need to watch their locations more
Enjoyable game thoughYes I did find this a bit cumbersome I wanted a more puzzle oridented game I kept getting stuck in seemingly absurd situations and go to a walkthrough forum to make progress One of the comforts is that a cheat code can take you to the next level if you get frustrated through not being able to figure out some trick to advance Lara is a great character But in this game she is faced with too many obstacles and impossibletodiscover secrets to make the game truly enjoyableOne of the best mario games ever made it was such a huge jump from the previous consoles looked and played amazingly hours of entertainment for anyone that enjoys adventure type gamesThe video quality is fine but if you have your hdmi plugged directly into your tv and have a separate receiver for audio the cables are way too short to fit in both so right now if I want to use the better video signal I have to use the tv audio Ill try to rip open the cables to make them reach but this is really a design flaw although many newer receivers have hdmi connectors on them there are a lot that dontFor anyone who was a fan of video games they remember the year of 

The Playstation made waves and drew many Nintendo fans away with its bit graphics and CD based games For the first time Nintendo was being challenged on its own ground and they had to answer Sony with a console of its own After they put the Super Nintendo system to rest they went to work and released the Nintendo  to the public The odds were against them because with only two launch titles to choose from early adopters had to either pick Pilotwings  a good game or Super Mario  This game was the reason Nintendos console immediately flew off the shelves and showed that Mario can make the jump to D and it was fun doing so

Ill make my review short because other reviewers had covered the basics and importance of Super Mario  It stars Mario in an open world where each stage is contained within various paintings scattered through Princess Peachs castle The storyline is pretty typical by now King Bowser kidnaps the princess and you jump in to rescue her The graphics are colorful bright and were a breakthrough in video game technology at the time The controls are perfect and take almost no time to get used to Its a pretty challenging game so expect to replay certain stages over and over again So why did I give it  stars The camera is not perfect but back then getting the camera to work in any open world style game was difficult to program It always centers behind you but sometimes gets a little wacky when you go up ledges or around corners It gets annoying after awhile but you learn to tolerate it

What made this game groundbreaking was that games of this type proved to be a challenge to make and to make it fun as well is really the main goal Super Mario  exceeds this and was a commercial success with gamers and gained much critical acclaim from reviewers of virtually every gaming publication Those who say didnt like were in the minority and for reasons that were just too petty and silly While gaming has changed tremendously since  this game shows that the platform genre was at one point the kind of games that everyone wanted to play And now you can either track down the cartridge or get this for the Nintendo DS So if you havent played this take a look for yourself as to why many gamers loved to play this game I highly recommend itIm not very good at video games so this game is pretty tough for me  I only have about  stars right now and Ive had it about a year  However other than the notsogreat D graphics and the silly camera angles it is a fun though challanging game  I look forward to someday getting all  starts  hahai remember when i was in high school and this game was brand new and just came out I played this sooooo much i got an ache in my hand Ive only beaten it once but ill tell you what in that one time it took me  to  months to beat iti found this game to be a challenge at first used to the old sidescrolling games of mario it took some time to get used to the fact its now in D

if you like mario you will love thi D gameWhat can I say This game is fun and funny at the same time From mario flying around with the magic caps to Mario burning his  cheeks on the hot lava this game is great My only problem with this game is the freakin camera angles AHHHHH sometimes I feel like I could just kick the Lakitu that controls the thing Angles sometimes get soooo akward that it makes it difficult to make a jump correctlyor so you wont go flying down to your death Other than that I give it a  Would be  if the camera was betterWhat a great game I like it alot The only problems I found were
 It gives off way too many hints to how to complete a puzzle or beat a bossEXAMPLE On the first time you fight Bowser he says Can you get behind me and grab my tail I think not

 Moving around is kinda stupid because Mario cant move to the different direction fast enough and he slips on the floor when he moves

Other than these flaws this is a solid title that deserves to be in your collectionI enjoyed this game  It was very fun  It was the very first game I owned for the N so I didnt really understand how the controls worked but this game was really easy to figure out  I love it  When I walk by it in stores and see it  Im speechless  It is a great game and by the looks of it the price it down too  This is definently worth your moneyWell I dont acttully have  stars but that is how much you are suposse to get But I have  stars I am onyy  so please awnser my revies for meThis game is so much fun  Ive always been a big fan of Mario since the beginning  The graphics are great and the sound is pretty good too  There are many different goals to reach in each level  Whether you have to collect coins or stars to open new levels I know youll love this gameSurprisingly when Nintendo created the N game system they had absolutely no idea of how succesful it would be The first game that the system ran on was also a scream It just sometimes comes to me as a surprise that a lot of these newer games that run on CDROM like the Playstation  and the XBOX may have faster and better graphics but not likely with the actual loading time
Nintendos Super Mario  remains as the most dynamic staple of any N system to date The graphics are just completely amazing and so strong from one angle to another In Super MArio  you guide Mario through  terrific stages with exciting adventure around every corner The object of the game is to try collect as many stars as possible that are hidden in the game Each star is very vital inorder to help you save Peach whom is still known as Princess Toadstool from the vile Bowser Each course takes you from all depths of the secret kingdom from Sea to the firey sky and even in a spooky ghostfilled house The load up time for this and every other N game is much faster than the CDRom games for the PC and the other CDRom console games
It is kind of sad Nintendo stopped making fantastic games on cartridge like this and traded it for a CDROM gaming factory with the Gamecube Nevertheless Super Mario  is still the most superior game of the th century and that is not even a pizzafaced lieThis is a great classic game that basically revolutionized Nintendo  but there is only one problem It is WAY too easy to beat But I guess since its an old game I can see why
Basically the mission is to recover all the  stars and save the Princess from the evil Bowser Its really easy and you can beat the game in about a month Even though I have plenty of Nintendo games I still go back to this game once in awhile because its a classic favorite Many current Nintendo games cant compete against it If only this game was a bit more challenging I think all new Nintendo  buyers should get this as there first game because you can explore alot with controls and skills thatll help you out in more challenging games
Any fans of Mario or Nintendo genre would like this game As far as kids there isnt much violence in this game No blood or gorey actions The price is pretty ok and the games plot is pretty ok There are many courses and places to explore so if you are a slow player itll take some time After you complete the game youll still be going back to it Seeing that my brothers and I already beat it over  times were finally getting tired of itI could knock a few stars off by going on and on about what they SHOULD have put into this game a playable Princess animal costumes Fire Flowers etc but such negativity could foolishly ruin such a great game Super Mario  isnt perfect but it has the best damn gameplay of any action title The worlds are massive with lots of vibrant colors whacky enemies catchy music and most importantly gameplay

The only downsides to this game are Marios horribly annoying voice an occasionally fussy camera and the possibility of graining your N control stick when you fight Bowser These minor neusances are mild though and they dont really hinder the gameplay All other downsides merely point to the characters themselves Mario speaks with a bad Italian accent voiced by Charles Martinet instead of his old Brooklyn one from the cartoon series I also dont like the changes made to Princess Toadstool Instead of the spunky redhead from the cartoon series she seems more like a dumb blonde with a weird voice

Yes this game is old but like fine wine games can get better with ageOne of the launch titles for the N back in  Super Mario  had only a small band of rivals at the time The most prominent being Star Wars Shadows of the Empire and Star Fox  The game has stood the test of time in several factors One you can still find it brand new Two the previous games mentioned are almost impossible to find unused Three for a launch game the graphics were great but they are not as good as late comer BanjoKazooie The story line is interesting and the levels are big but not as large as BanjoKazooie You have to find  Power Stars that Bowser stole from Princess Peachess castle and if you get all  you can go to a cannon near the castle hop inside shoot onto the roof of the castle meet Yoshi Marios dinosaur friend who will give a super new jump and  lives The games levels are challenging espicially the last few levels and the levels where you fave Bowser you have to beat him three times are DANGEROUS especially the last one From the sea to land to desert to snow covered mountain and to the desert and beyond Mario must battle enemies in d and collect six stars on every level Five stars are attainable by completing tasks while the sixth is attainable when you collect  coins on a level The music is hummable and the characters are nice and mean This is still Marios biggest adventure and with the coming of the Gamecube and the fall in price for the Nintendo  and its games Super Mario  is a must have Ive had my  since Christmas  and also received Super Mario  which is still a GREAT gamegreat graphics good gameplay if you want a challenging game get this one its kinda hard itll keep you busy for a couple of weeksThis game is fun but dont expect a classic Super Mario game This one is way diffrent than any other Mario game before it but still great in its own wayI bought this game in  over a year after it was released The first few weeks i played it i was amazed at the beautiful D graphics Honestly  i had never seen D graphics before this game so it was awesome and  inspiring
I love this game so im writing this review There are some  memorable moments from this game like when Mario ventures into the haunted  mansion or when he goes on a rainbow ride in the skies
All in all it  showcases the N incredible D graphics and the sound isnt half  bad
The levels are interesting and sparse  i beat this game with the  Nintendo Power guidebook and should take some time to crack the puzzles  Basically the game is quite easy and not surprisingly it has enough  miniquests and puzzles to keep you occupied As for level designs i think  its excusable considering its first generation stuff but still deep  enough to immerse you again after a long absence
My gripe is while  this game is really good i mean im a bigtime Mario fan from the first  mario game its only as good as it lasts I found it hard to go back to  this game after a while cause it was like having discovered everything and  it made it hard to play through the whole thing again
My advice play  selectively You need to get into the mood While i say that its without  doubt that i have never regretted buying this game
Even if i never play  this game again and leave it to collect dust not likelyill always  remember this game as one of the finest moments of the N lifetime that  is 
Anyway every Super Mario game is groundbreaking SMB  created the sidescroller SMB was queer and fun SMB is the greatest  platform game ever SMB was one of the most replayed game i ever played  and this game is mario in D without luigiwhich is sad
But cheer up  people the next generation is almost upon us But i know that when we look  at D graphics today we will know that this game had a part to play in  making this our reality todayAnyone who has ever played a flight sim can tell this is not like Awarthog just by reading the info on the game This is an arcade type game with some sim stuff add to make it sell more and be kind of fun and fast to play Sometimes we all just want to blow the blank out of things and unwind This is fairly well made and the graphics are ok for what it isa game
If you want a real flight sim this is not it If you just want to get online and have some fun with others for a while this is it The target aircraft can do hard right and left turns that would take the wings of any aircraft and thats not right but this is a game and not a sim This was made sometime ago and graphics have come along way but it is ok for its time
You will not have any issues installing this or running this game on most systems with a gtx or better You can max out all setting with one evga gtxti gb video card The install dose take some time to get done and it will update for you when you run the sim the first time This all takes min or so counting the install of the game
It is what it is and thats a game not a flight sim but it is fun to play a few hours now and then
I have a solid system and have had no issues running this at all
If you are looking for a real flight sim that has ture reallistic flight of the aircraft and working cockpits this is not for you Try Awarthog or wings over europe or wings over vietnam or IL These are flight sims and run well on any solid sysetm with xp or windows  runningIt makes you think I agree that few new surprises are discovered after the first bit fo time but I find I can keep playing it whenever I need just a little tedious activity to occupy me Personally I like to listen to books on tape while I playbut thats just me

My suggestion Buy it its worth itMaking a City its a change for once I like this game because it gives easy control and its fun to play There are some downsides to it too like it takes too long to make a big city and Sims complain tooooo much but its all good other then that My favorite thing to do is save the city then rip it down by disteasters The good thing is you dont have to save it after you destory it This game can be easy or hard like if you want to make a big city it takes time and its hard but if you use codes likeI am weak Call coison Vinnie I love Red Tape Power to the masses Water in the desert Garage in garage out and nardz roolactually spelling its eazy  Graphics well it isnt that good on making small sims but good on everything else  Fun a very fun game isnt has fun as some games but its cool Gameplay well if you like making cities then it has long gameplay  Sound I really like the sound because it makes me think more Overall you would love this game but its fun isnt like some games  which is GreatAwesome and  stars for Sim City I enjoy playing this game for the most part I have spent hours glued to the computer watching my cities grow Unfortunately as the cities increase in population so does the chances of the computer crashing  a very annoying problem Also the parades last too long the seaports are difficult to develop the terrain for some cities such as St Louis are unusually hilly and the buildings look alike The game is not that challenging But overall a recommended gameThis is a nice little arcade game with good graphics and some good chatter Its fun to play with after spending time with DCS Blackshark  Its a good shootem up enjoyableFirst off let me clear up some misstatements about the features listed above by amazoncom
Realistic D environment
Wrong The game is D it merely looks D It IS realistic however There is far more detail in  D than could ever have been done in D and still hae it run on everyones  machine
View cities from up to  feet
I guessyou have  zoom  levels The above implies that you can zoom to any level
Detailed  control over businesses and other facilities
None whatsoever other than  being able to zone blocks of residential commercial and industrial areas  along with other specialized zones You cant micromanage any individual  businesses
Everything and everyone moves
Cars and SimCitizens move  so do some animated buildings but certainly not EVERYTHING
Optional  loadin sets for customization and enhancements
Thats handled much  better in SCK Unlimited
SimCity  is a mixed bag for me I love  being able to play a fully updated version of  but whether it should  be called  or  is something of a dilemma
Graphicswise  is  beautiful No two ways about it A lot of hype has gone into the fact that  you can now zoom in and see little sims walking driving around in  individual cars and so on The building images are now fully sided  entities so that rotating the view yields  different looks at each  feature Five zoom levels let you choose the size youre comfortable with  to build on Some people claim that the buildings are blocky and pixellated  at the highest zoom I dont have that problem but they are definitely not  the crisp renders that the other  zooms are They are merely enlargements  of the th zoom Vehicles and pedestrians remain crisp and distinct at any  zoom
Gameplay heres the sticking point for me If youve continued to  play SimCity  until youre redeyed and guaranteed to be late for  workschool youll probably do the same with  Given all the new bells  and whistles itll take some time to try them all and see how this affects  that From this point however two camps emerge One camp will continue  playing the game for years and loving every minute of it relishing the  freedom to create anything they want I fall into this category The other  camp once having seen everything and mastered building megalopoli at will  are going to wonder whats the fun anymore So depending on your  expectations for the game itll be either a gift from heaven or something  you may well have wished didnt cost  to  bucks
As for difficulty  its no harder really than  Some of the new features like garbage  disposal ordinances and neighboring city dealings add depth and strategy  without making the game unduly complex Maxis should be commended for  that
Overall Its good In fact its very good They put a lot of work  into it making sure everything balances more or less Is it worth the  money Not now with SCK Unlimited out Get it instead as its much more  refined If you havent played a SimCity game before or if youre a diehard   fan absolutely If you just sorta liked  and quit playing it  after a little bit you may want to wait until it hits the bargain rackPerhaps SCKs main problem is that it is far too detailed Even on a speedy topend machine the screen will fill with portions of white if you try to scroll at one of higher resolutions Perhaps this is also SCKs  main virtue  the fact that you can see down to the last person in your  metropolis Whatever you say despite the games vast graphical and  notsovast strategic advances it failed to do what the fans of the series  held closest to their hearts  personalization The city develops  completely at random within your zonal confines  you cannot make a  candleshop district a Downtown or anything of the sort You cannot name  streets despite the fact that you place them yourself The papers mention  you rarely and glancingly at best preferring to metion senseless rock  bands whose names you cannot supply either or some other uneventful  thing The advisors are as helpful as ever  specifically useless They  either take no notice of the trouble befalling your city or they take  notice of something very minor and blow it up to the size of a scandal THE   COMMERCIAL TAX IS KILLING THE CITY  REMOVE THE PARKING FINES  All  the while industry fails to develop and a major power outage goes  unnoticed
This game is a cleaner crisper version of SimCity   perhaps an update but in no way a new game in the seriesThis is a one player st person shooter The goal is to finish each level by finding keys weapons and health kits all the while killing as many commies that look like monsters as possible and trust me there are lots of  commies There are hidden secrets throughout the game and any number of  sites on the net to tell you where those secrets are The villians get  smarter and tougher as you progress through the game the st opponents are  just some slow moving shotgun toting targets later levels have half  ramhalf man beasts that are almost invincible shooting rockets at you  Good thing you can get a double barrel shotgun a minigun anti aircraft  type weapon brass knuckles a rocket launcher a plasma gun a pistol and  even a chainsaw for those up and close encounters Ever wonder what it  would be like to walk into a building and just start shooting everyone in  sight If so there are two things you need  Profesional help  This  game Good deal at this priceI used to own this game and while it is not the game I miss most I still do think about it from time to time The visuals are very good for the Ns graphics engine and the voice acting though there isnt a whole lot is pretty good The control is a bit of a problem as is the camera However this is not a big surprise for it is the first time the series of Castlevania has been moved to the third dimension Then again other series didnt really have that much trouble in the third dimension Zelda Mario Final Fantasy Breath of Fire etc but you cant always win can you The music is awesome naturallyits Castlevania The sound effects are also good The boss design is highly unique as well and most importantly ITS FUN I bought it for a mere  and it was actually worth it Though I have sold it I might try and purchase a friends copy If you are looking for a game that is a bit more simplistic in design than the classic Castlevania titles then this is your ticket for sureExtremely difficult to play  unless youre an expert Have to admit  great graphics Main problem with this particular game is that after maybe say an hour or so it tends to get a bit old Many  and I do mean many levels to conquer I would only recommended this game to patrons who have plenty of patience You know  the kind of patience that is required while youre on Ebay  trying to wait until the bids end to an item that you want so very bad only to have one of those pesky lastminute snipers to come by and outbid you within the very last ten seconds That kind of patience I much prefer the Atari  version of this video gameCastlevania  offers you the experience of seeing a Castlevania adventure in a freeroaming D realm I have played every Castlevania game right back to the NES days and this is a good addition to a fine series This is a great game but not as good as Castlevania Symphony of the Night for Playstation
To start on a positive note there is a lot of depth added thanks to the D graphics You can roam freely battle monsters facetoface and search for hidden items without the constraints of sidescrolling The control is responsive and the buttons are easy to figure out which is good considering the pace of the game The D worlds are huge and are fun to explore The sound is also excellent You can hear the clatter of bones the snapping of jaws and the cracking of whips clearly without that horrible distortion that we all remeber from earlier installments
The cons of this game are mostly technical nothing to do with the graphics or storyline First of all the camera can be a servere pain sometimes It often lingers when you dont want it to and the response time for panning and scanning is pertty bad
The control is good but sometimes it is clunky when you need to perform delicate movements I remember the first level when I kept falling into the water and dying when I tried to jump from one ledge to another and missed by one inch Also a map would be helpful Certain areas look the same as others and sometimes I cannot tell where I have been and where I am going But as I said these are more technical flaws They dont exactly ruin the game
Overall this game is fun and gives a whole new depth to the longrunning series But as good as this is Castlevania SOTN for Playstation is much betterThis is a classic for so many reasons One of the first major releases for the FPS genre It looks and feels like the PC version at least from my memory and is as fun as I always rememberedThe game itself was in ok condition and the case was good Im giving this  of  stars because at least the game works just fine If it werent for that this would have been a  star rating at bestI had this version in the s and played it while a teenager  I now repurchased it and am playing it in  as a  year old  It is STILL visceral brooding and epic in its dark atmosphere  In some ways the minimalist D of the original DOOM particularly in this port lends itself well to the overall gloomy atmosphere  It creates a certain menacing bleakness in the landscape

One thing that REALLY makes this a DOOM to remember is the TOTALLY BENT EPIC DRONECORE DARK AMBIENT SOUNDTRACK  Playing DOOM on my modern computer despite the incredible graphics just isnt quite the same without that HAUNTING soundtrack  Seriously the soundtrack to this particular version of DOOM is so totally harrowing and visceral as to be nearly a moving life experience  You will never quite forget it after hearing it  The soundtrack is certainly one of the best of all time for a video game  It is profoundly moody unrelentingly heavy and completely out there  It sounds like something Steve Roach might create after surviving a journey through Hell and then having Trent Reznor as the music producer

Overall this is quite a good port over to the original Playstation  Original DOOM is an all time classic with brilliant level design and awesome action that set the standard for years  Pick up this version used and fade away into that crazy soundtrack from another level of existenceDoom for PS is a great game Almost every level from Ultimate Doom  Doom II is here plus some new levels never before seen on the PC This game is dark scary as hell and can really get in your head The soundtrack is totally different from the PC and creates a very eerie atmosphere that few games ever do The controls are easy to learn thats a good thing However the only reason why I gave this game  stars instead of  is because of the graphics Yes as you may have already read the graphics are a bit sluggish especially when compared to the PC version In my opinion the best version of Doom is the PC version period Doom Doom  and Final Doom are the best video games ever in MY opinionI know this will sound crazy but the main reason I finally broke down and purchased a Playstation several years ago was because I wanted to play some of the wrestling games available for this particular console  For whatever reason no one has ever come close to producing a decent wrestling game for the PC  At the time I was a serious wrestling fan having been drawn back to the fold by the brilliant internal division in WCW between the good guys and the evil NOW  WCW Thunder came out while the WCW was at its peak of popularity and I just had to have it  While the game has naturally lost some of its luster as time has passed and gaming hardware improved it had all sorts of enticing features then and remains a fun diversion even now
WCW Thunder had a lot to offer fans when it was released  For starters you had some  superstars to choose from including the biggest names around such as Goldberg and Hogan all kinds of other hidden wrestlers also lay buried inside the game waiting for you to win with certain characters or use the handy dandy cheat codes to unlock themeverything from madeup goofy characters to the wrestlers who got beat up for a living every week to announcers to members of the Nitro Girls including the luscious Kimberly  While certain basic moves worked for all wrestlers each individual wrestler including the hidden ones had their own signature moves  Thus you could have Goldberg take his opponent out with the Spear followed by the Jack Hammer or have Lex Luger turn a man into a little baby while hoisted up in the Torture Rack  Each wrestler came with his own theme music and personal allegiance but you had the option of changing a guys alliance  This could become important in terms of one of my favorite features of the game the ability to have an ally come to the ring to help you avoid a loss or just to help you beat the heck out of your opponent
The game offers a number of game types for one or two players  You can fight an exhibition match or go for the TV Title US Heavyweight Title or walk that aisle in pursuit of the World Heavyweight belt  If you get tired of oneonone action you can choose tagteam play or battle it out with  other wrestlers in a Battle Royal  You can even get down to brass tacks and battle it out in a cage match  The only bad thing about a cage match is the fact that it does not allow you access to any weapons  In normal game play there are a number of weapons outside the ring you control how many that you can pick up and use to beat the fool out of everybody that gets in your way you can even just keep wailing on your opponent after he hits the ground
WCW Thunder is and never was perfect though  For one thing the game quickly becomes rather easy  You can just pile drive your opponent over and over again into oblivion if you like or take a stop sign upside a guys head a dozen or more times and pin him easily  The clumsy combination moves actually become a good thing here because it is sometimes a challenge to perform that special killer move your wrestler is famous for and end the match in style  The graphics are decent but not great and my Playstation seems to have a few hitches in its gittyup when it tries to render large numbers of wrestlers all at once in Battle Royal mode  I still enjoy playing WCW Thunder though  It looks a lot like the earlier WCW Nitro game but it plays a lot better in my opinion  There are better games available now even for the Playstation but I have a feeling that Ill be enjoying this game on and off for many years to comeHavent had a chance to extensively play it yet but it arrived quickly and works wellThe game works great the only bad part it that the game smells like smoke but nothing a can of fabreeze could not handleI used to play this game years ago lol The funniest foul mouthed rd graders stick it to the turkeys once and for all From dart guns pee drenched snow balls this game is a good laugh for south park fansThis is truly a funny game It captures the feel of South Park with its cartoony style The weapons are funny like snowballs nd fire yellow snowballs to plungers The voices from the show are funny I recomend this game to any South Park fan out thereSure this games been out for alomost four years now but its time I reviewed it The exceptionally popular foulmouth TV shows based on the fictional yet epic adventures of Kyle Cartman Stan and the now removed Kenny four innocent little third graders now fourth in the snowy mountain town of Colorado Its a wonderful life you have a gay teacher a pimpdaddy chef a best friend who dies more than  times a week and all the Cheesy Poofs you could ever want At least until killer turkeys aliens clones and toys invade your town and try to take it over YOU and YOU alon must prevent these attacks or you could just leave the worthless town to be burnt but then the games no fun
Like all shooters I only enjoy this game with cheats The master cheat for this game is BOBBYBIRD or if you break it down BOBBY BIRD It unlocks every weapon level and everything else your twisted little mind wants from this game
In singleplayer you assume the role of either Stan Cartman Kenny or who I always pick Kyle Each comes with their own insults and comments As you progress you find Kenny Cartman and Stan and they come with you but you cant play as or with them They just allow you to hold more weapons and item I guess thats because its four pairs of hands Your first mission is to destroy the turkeys and ultimatly the gigantic roboturkey Without cheats you start with a snowball or you can advance it and make it a yellow snowball and if youve seen Jackass you know what that is The other weapons are a cow launcher a toymachine gun and more Sooooo much more
This game is a good game but only if youre a fan of the TV show Even though it would be fun if some people werent theyd still annoy everyone complaining of bad language and foul humor Ignore them If youre a fan get this or at least rent it LaterSouth Park the video game is all right I dont think its smash worthy but I really dont think its flush worthy either because it did probably one of the smarter things and totally copied  GoldenEye and gave it a total South Park twist
As usual weird stuff is happening around South Park like mad killer turkeys are attacking the city strange mutants are running around and crazy self propelled toys are out to get you as you take the baddest  year olds on the planet Stan Kyle Kenny and Cartman on this strange vulger and very gratuitous journey
I gotta say it the game was funny and it made me laugh all the way through especially if you ran across the Terrance and Phillip bombs Other than that I really didnt feel there was much else besides all the cool codes like all the weapons codes and stuff and that you could be so many people in the multiplayer mode like Officer Barbrady Mr Mackey Mkay Terrance and Phillip and if you really wanted to Starvin Marvin
The story is really silly but then again when is there an episode of South Park that isnt just plain out ridiculous Exactly The controls are pretty easy too You can set it to GoldenEye style of control or for you advanced users you can use a Turok type of control
I still gotta say that I wouldnt play it for its story mode Personally Id play it for its multiplayer mode because thats what the game is really good at That and I personally thought you could do a lot more in the vs modes rather than in the story modes
For you parents most of the swearing is bleeped out but a few choice phrases are in there so give it a thought before you buy it for your kids For those of you that dont have to worry about that order a pizza call over a few friends and throw on some South Park multiplayer Have funThis game is pretty good for its own sake Its basically about a dead warrior in a land of ghouls  zombies who attack him at every turn  it is up to you to find the Chaos Rune among other hidden treasures arrayed throughout this underworld of bizarre incarnations

 The animations are up to D par although I will remark on the variety of different angles The graphics are japanamistic but nonetheless amusingthis game is very old but today its still just as good as any tekan streetfighter or mortal combat The only down side is the controls are a little different then most gamesI picked this up the other day It only took a few hours to finish the player mode but I suppose the fact that Id previously played BattleTanx Global Assault on PS helped me out a little

Story Some virus gets out of control and eliminates  of the females on planet earth This dude named Griffin is in love with this girl and then the government comes and takes her away Meanwhile gangster militias that are armed with Tanks take over the US and likely the rest of the world Griffin vows to get his girlfriend back and save America from the various Tank gangs

Gameplay You play the entire campaign through in your stereotypical mock Abrams tank blasting through enemy defenses and rescuing or kidnapping women Your tribal army needs women to stay in existence Different gangs have different types of tanks There are a variety of powerups for your tank like swarmer missiles guided missiles lasers and gun buddies you can set down to defend areas Most of the missions remind me of a multiplayer session of Capture the Flag from any number of FPS games BattleTanxs singleplayer is unique in that regard

Controls They work pretty good No complaints

Multiplayer Theres no coop campaign BOO P You can play through various types of matches most of which resemble the singleplayer levels against friends or the AI You can use the tanks of enemy games in the multiplayer Thats all good and well I guess but I know I can blow my friends to kingdom come What I really wanted was to be able to play it through the campaign on  players

Graphics Theyre early N but they look alright I dont like the fact that your main tank in singleplayer looks so cartoony The comicstyle storytelling is unique and I think theyre way better than PS Global Assaults campy voiceacting

If youre a fan of the BattleTanx series I suppose owning what I assume is the first entry is important However if I had to choose between this game and its sequel I would choose the latter due to its better singleplayer campaignThis game is interesting  My sister made me pick it up and it is fun to mess around with  If you are looking for a cute little adventure platformer then this is it  The graphics are good and the control isnt too tricky  It does get difficult in parts but not overly  I am not a huge fan of platform games but this one got me with its unique humorous tones  Give it a shot on your PS if you havent  Its a bargainSoul Edge  Circa

ADDITIONAL NOTES

 This is the first game in the Soul Caliber franchise

 In the arcade this game was called Soul BladeDecently priced disk has scratches It plays okay skips sometimes freezes Price high for damaged merchandiseThis is the very first twisted metal game to come out and i loved it It is different than the rest of them but it is still fun to play It has the original people and tracks to go to so if u have played any of the other twisted metal games u will reconize most of these people It is very hard to beat because it is the first game and it took a long time to get used to The graphics well this is the first one its on the ps and it is a very old game so yes they r not very good It is all blocky and the cars move in weird directions This is a great game on multiplayer though there r many different things to do unstead of just battleing each other After u beat the game a couple of times it is easy to play and beat ur friends at it This is a very fun but challenging gameIve only played Twisted Metals  and  but not the first two games in the seriesTwisted Metal  has cheats to unlock the bosses like Sweet Tooth Minion etcI had Dirt  on Xbox  and it was an okay game I started playing games on my laptop and bought a few new games to build my collection This game is very fun to play It is so much better than Dirt  If you like racing games you should check this out The graphics are perfect on my compterI dint get this game until almost a year ago but I still find it to be pretty fun It has a tiny roster with only ten guys that is EXTREMELY outdated but I recognized most of the guys several of them being among my favorite wrestlers The only one who was completely unfamiliar to me was Ahmed Johnson I think the graphics are really good although the wrestlers arent very large on the screen and the gameplay is done pretty well No the game isnt very realistic but I think that just adds to the fun Some people seem to have issues with the load times but I dont really think the load times are bad at all Ive played games that have much longer load times I think this game is much better than WCW Vs The World which is one of the only two other wrestling games I have for PS even though that game has many more guys on itWWF In Your House while graphically WORSE than WWF Wrestlemania The Arcade Game should not be ignored if you like that Wrestlemania game because In Your House features the exact same arcade wrestling action  The wrestlers have been updated too

Yes WWF In Your House is an old game with noticeably average graphics and notso smooth animations  It came out in  I believe  The graphics simply arent as good as Wrestlemania The Arcade Game  BUT if youre a fan of Wrestlemania The Arcade Game I see no reason why you wouldnt like In Your House

Some reviewers claim this game is hard  Its really not that hard once you remember the most effective and damaging moves Its easier than Wrestlemania The Arcade Game  In fact if you consider yourself a fast gamer you wont have ANY trouble with In Your House  Theres an option to put the game on easy so if you must put the game on easy  Also turning blocking off helps make the game much easier  Using the run button thats located at the top of the Playstation controller I believe its either L or R or maybe both is a MUCH better idea than using the OTHER way of running hitting two buttons at once ugh

The loading time is somewhat worse than Wrestlemania The Arcade Game but only somewhat  In Your House takes maybe  or  seconds longer to load a match if that  Unfortunately the way Vince McMahon introduces the wrestlers is pretty bland and uninteresting compared to Wrestlemania the Arcade Game where you actually saw the wrestlers running forward towards their opponents featuring their own distinct animations such as Shawn Michaels posing and Doink the clown squirting water  In this game Vince just SAYS who youre facing while a boring picture appears on screen showing the wrestlers  Its not as good

You get to play as  wrestlers and each wrestler has his own set of unique moves  Its better to try finishing off your opponent using the moves that drain the most energy  Thats the number one rule to winning

Going through a World Title tournament in Wrestlemania The Arcade Game takes about  minutes  Here it takes about  minutes because you have to compete in more matches  Its not a problem at all though  If anything its better this way because its so much fun going through all the rounds and whipping out one devastating move after another  Some of these moves are realistic while other moves are too extreme for wrestlers to be able to perform in reality  For example the Ultimate Warrior shooting lightning and the Undertaker shooting some kind of demonic spirits at you  It doesnt happen in real life

You get to play as Shawn Michaels Vader Bret Hart Owen Hart Ahmed Johnson The British Bulldog Davey Boy Smith The Undertaker Goldust The Ultimate Warrior and Hunter Hearst Helmsley  People may complain that this is a really small list of wrestlers to choose from but its actually better than the more updated wrestling games on the market today that feature WAY too many wrestlers that have no reason to exist  At least with a small selection you will be able to remember all your opponents main power moves  Plus giving you a small list of selectable wrestlers makes it feel more like a short and intense arcade game which is the point

Its probably the hardest going through the tournaments all three of them with Goldust because his energy seems to drain very quickly and its probably the easiest to complete these tournaments with Shawn Michaels or the British Bulldog Davey Boy Smith because they have MANY power moves that finish your opponent off very quickly

But as I said above this game is worse than Wrestlemania The Arcade Game because the graphics and animations arent in the same league  But see the thing is In Your House and Wrestlemania the Arcade Game are the ONLY arcade wrestling games with the WWE logo on them  This means we only have TWO games like this that exist in the entire world  Sure beats having a million slowmoving big and bulky D WWE games out there that have no major innovations implemented whatsoever to separate themselves right

I have a lot of fun with these arcade style wrestling games so realism doesnt matter to me at all  I will take this game over any and all of the bestlooking WWE wrestling games that are so popular today  I prefer wrestling games that are FAST and thats what In Your House is all about  Its fast exciting unique and with practice not very difficult to complete  Who cares about graphics

So in short I dont CARE that In Your House is sort of a lowbudget looking WWE game  This and Wrestlemania are the only games like it

Also the commentators Vince McMahon and Mr Perfect have a LOT more things to say in In Your House compared to Vince and Jerry Lawler in Wrestlemania The Arcade Game  Also worth mentioning each wrestler has their own special thing to say at the beginning and end of a match  Okay so they dont say things ALL the time but many times they do

Both the Playstation and Saturn versions are great  The Playstation version has shorter loading times and plus I think the Playstation controller is better for delivering moves because of the simple button layout  Also theres a Sound Test option only in the Playstation version where you can hear all the sound effects and theme songs in the game  I mean EVERY SINGLE THING you hear in the game can be found in the sound menu  Its pretty awesome

The Saturn version has a couple things that the Playstation version doesnt have so dont worry Saturn fans  Exclusive to the Saturn version includes an extra move for the Undertaker in this version you can deliver multiple chokeslams to your opponent  you cant do this on the Playstation version and plus the Saturn version was created so you can perform finishing moves whenever you want whereas in the Playstation version they can only be delivered during oneonone matches  It doesnt matter how many people you are facing on the Saturn version you can deliver finishing moves at the end of every match if youd like

Either version is great thoughYou wouldnt expect it but this game is good for all the wrong reasons If you were to buy this you wouldnt think the best wrestlers would be the the guys you never heard of right By far the best finishing move in the game is called The Alcapulco by some guy whos name I cant remember Its the most devastating move ive ever seen in wrestling if he does this in real life to other people I would suspect these people often become paralyzed
I will attempt to describe the move it starts off as a regular suplex but once he has the guy verticle in the air he releases him and comes down into a piledriver So basicaly your being dropped directly on your head from  ft in the air A regular piledriver is like  ft and you have almost no momentum Same with a tombstone piledriver This tops both by alot
Besides this one move the game is average overall not great not bad But this one thing made it better than average for me worth a look in my opinionThe Good scary fun gameplay with multiple enemies and atmosphere great story both main and in play good soundtrack for most part added menu options to play good replay with two characters
The Bad voice acting and cutscenes despite good story really bad soundtrack for the least part repetitive puzzling of item get and push things bad graphics for its time Tank Controls
The Neutral secrets and unlocks such as costumes difficulty is up and down low health and ammo pickups cam angles varythis is a pretty good game except for the music gets annoying sometimes such as the B floor of the mansion however the disc had a few scratches it was in good condition Super fun while simultaneously hard PS classic This is a perfect game for the nostalgia gamer that secretly dreams of being a ninjaIf only the movie was as good  Ive missed playing this game so much glad to have it back in my collectionThis games is one of those few titles where stealth killing is actualy fun Tenchu had competant graphics for the time though ugly by  standards The controls definately had issues but lets face it this is the best Tenchu game to date Tenchu has not alway done well as a franchise but this has its charming moments Years later the thing that sticks out most to me is the Soundtrack There are certain games you hang onto for the BGMs This is one of those games The over the top stealth kill and trying to unlock certain items is well and good but the music is the thing that always calls me back This games wonky graphics and play controls were never anything to write home about and only got worse with each consequential sequal and retread The first one is the best in the series in my opinion Priority was never graphics or packaging It was all about the fun and lovely soundtrackThis is a great stealth game and one of the first I ever played besides Metal Gear Solid I spent many hours on this just being sneaky The main thing I liked about this is that its not your typical run around hack and slash game You actually had to think about what youre doing and what the outcome would be The voice acting wasnt that great but it was at the time when this came out I think most peoples problem with this game myself included was the annoying camera angle at time but once you got used to it it wasnt that bad Definately a classic game in my bookI have been playing video games since pong the s and I have change with the time bought a new system every year they come outand love some of the new play station games but its good to have some old favorites When I bought VOl  just for Mrs Pacmanit was like WOW I forgot about pole position ya nothing like nascar  but that use to be my favorite when I was a kid  still is Funny thing is when I was yrs old I could never get past the nd screen in Galaxian Now  years later of playing video games I still cant get past the nd screen even though I master Sypro a  game in  days
I have to admit druaga  phozon were never favorites when I was kid but there hoot to play now just seeing those out of date graphics yep the graphic may be pathetic  game idea may seem simple but they are still challenging and a good reminder of what the good old days of video games were likeNamco Volume  is a well rounded collection of classic arcade favorites It features Ms Pacman DigDug Galaxian which became addictive very fast after a few plays alsofeatures Pole Position II Phozen which I had never heard of till this collection Its not for everyone and last but not least we haveThe Tower of Druaga Obviously the best games are Ms Pacman Galaxian and DigDug which each of these games are worth having individually so having them all on one disc its hard to go wrong But wait there is one slight problem When you go to the screen that allows you to change the dip switcheswhen they pop up they cover the menu and you dont know what your changing until you get back to the game only to realize you have unknowingly changed your amount of lives to  and set your bonus on  or something to that effect Maybe its just me but I would have preferred a modern menu instead of the switches Nevertheless  STARSMaximum vintage gameage  This game is packed with the best and worst of the arcade days  First theres Ms PacManthough this might be the Japanese version the Midway one played differently  Galaxian is the precursor to Galaga maybe it shouldve been on Volume  instead  Phozon is based on the atom principleyou collect the various atoms with your Xshaped thingy to form various shapes matching the ones in the background  Dig Dug also back features that guy in a suit digging in the underground collecting fruitsvegetables and dropping rocks on or blowing up Pookas little bouncing orange creatures with big eyes and Fygars basically small dragons  Pole Position II is the sequel to Pole Position this time you have your choice of  tracks to race on  I didnt play Tower of Druaga much as I dont care for that game  Dont forget you can also check out knowledgehistory of the games in the various Museum virtual rooms theres even a stack of NG magazine covers in the Library  If you were addicted in the early s get addicted againonly this time you dont need quarters to playNamco Museum  third in a series of five collections of old arcade hits hits some high and low spots but is well worth the purchase price for three games  The best of the lot is the translation of Ms PacMan  very faithful to the original  Galaxian is highly addictive and equally faithful to the original  Most people dont give DigDug the credit its due  it is very entertaining  even for adults  I rather liked DigDug in the arcades and this is a good rendition  On the other hand Phozon and Tower of Druga are very forgettable Tower the most worthless of the lot  Still well worth buying just for the excellent Ms Pac ManI found another ninja game called Tenchu Stealth Assassin I read the back of it and it looked pretty good When I tried it back at home I was blown away This game was really sweet And after I tried the demo of Ninja Shadow of Darkness that was in my game Fighting Force I realized I was lucky that I didnt waste my money on it
I would never trade this game in for that other stupid one This game is incredible Going up to guys from behind and killing them with classic stealth kills like the throat slit and the stab from up front Not only that but the enemies that you fight in the game are awesome samurai ninjas bears wolves dogs and all kinds of demons This game is totally awesome if a bit slow though It the jumping and fighting action were more like it was in Devil May Cry it would have been just like playing in a Japanese anime Oh well it was still a good game If youre a true ninja fan you must have this game you wont regret itUnlike the Corny ninja titles of years past like Ninja Gaiden Ninja and others of that manner  Tenchu finally takes the  Ninja game to the next level  Not just a run around and throw stars at  senseless weak enemies this game forces you to learn and master stealth  and the art of sneak attack  The different weapons available keep the  onslaught more versatile and the different sword attacks seem to stun the  viewer with there harsh and brutal images  A great game  a great story  line but still a few small problems  even though you have a large variety  of weapons they are very limited  some of the game may be confusing and  not very straight forward as to what you are supposed to do and you tend  to run into some very annoying camera views that seem to definately take  away from the game play  But overall its a very entertaining game which  i recommend to any action fanGame works perfectly Arrived as expected I guess its me but i find this game rather difficult to beatThis is perhaps my favorite arcade collection of all time The PS Namco Museum series is a very interesting twist on the arcade compilation formula The innovative things about these games is that you have the option of walking around in a literal Namco Museum and there are doors which represent each game whats awesome about walking around in the museum is that each door for each game you go into has excellent buildup and atmosphere to get you pumped to play the game and since it is a museum each games room has a plethera of interesting history of Namco for example in the Dig Dug room you can click on these action figures that are on display and they represent real toys that Namco actually produced There are also these sort of tips and tricks scattered on the walls of each room as well as more history other than merchandise Its a brilliant idea and luckily this game has an amazing roster of games It has Ms Pacman Dig Dug which is my favorite arcade game of all time Galaxian Pole Position  Tower of Druaga and Phozon which is a really strange sort of puzzle game Lastly because of personal bias this game means a lot to me It introduced me to Namco and some arcade classics and some of the museum locations invoked wonder and curiosity in me and they make me happy whenever I see them One last thing to note you do not need to walk through the museum you can quick start a game if you want toWith the release of Crash Bandicoot  Cortex Strikes Back Naughty Dog took just about everything from the first game and made it better

Graphics   The environments in this game look spectacular The great use of color and detail and the flat shading on Crashs character model really blend well together to make a game that aged very well

Sound   Similar to the first the music in this one is average It fits the game well and each song does a good job representing each stage its in but the tunes were very unmemorable for me

Gameplay   The single greatest addition to the gameplay was the ability to use the analog pad on the Dualshock controller That alone makes the game control much smoother Other than that the game plays just as good as the firstI like this game I looked at it and it was very cool I played levels like Turtle Woods and Snow Go I liked this because I liked fighting Cortex I watched the bonus levels on Youtube because I didnt want to do them I like collecting crystals and gems I give this a  stars out of Other then having to blow into the cartridge a lot when I first got it it has run smoothly now I just need to remember how to playNot love but like This rubber grip gives you alot of grip but needs to be smoothed out with a razor blade before use Im happyThis silicone cover has a very nice feel to it Dont use this with dirty hands dirt will stick to it This is a ok product for your  controllerI had this game given to me for free years ago on the PC format I liked it but for some reason it crashed on me one day and I mustve done something to the disc cause it never worked or would reinstall on any computer after that

All these years later Ive just picked it up second hand for the N And I must say there is not really any difference between the PC version and the  version which is a good thing

The only difference is in the movies The PC and I spose gaystation version had the movies  ending in video form where as the  replicates them the same way using the polygons of the d characters themselves I have no complaint about it I like it wether its video form or D poly form They both still tell the same story Except Reiko who just walks off into a portal the other versions show what happens when he goes into the portal he puts on his Shoa Kahn mask shame thats not in it

All the codes and moves where the same and I like the fact that the PRACTIVE mode allows you to press pause and choose a list that displays all the characters moves fatalitys and weapens etc tho im really kind of sick of the combinations of move lifts which makes it great to just go into the options highlight continues  and hold down blockrun untill it takes you to the hidden menu where you can turn on auto fatalitys and stuff

The only bad thing I can say about the game is what it should have had included It needed to be fixed so that the auto fatalitys worked like in MK TRILOGY All platforms EXCEPT the N version where each button freformed a diffrent fatality  fats freindship babality etc that about it

This game is one of the best head to head fighter games Unfortunatly the team at Crapcom decided to make a billion versions of Street Fighter for every other system talk about over kill but they didnt wanna make one for the  so thats there loss which means Mortal Kombat is the best head to head fighter on the  if you ask me

This game is actualy converted to the  straight from the arcade and then extras where added in after that which makes it better then the arcade Like the fact you can play as Goro  Noobsaibot and a skinless character named Meat go to GameFaqcom for the codes

MK is the best head to head fighter on the N in this realmResident Evil Directors Cut  The PSX rerelease of the  survival horror game

  Back when the PSX was first released the system didnt have much in the way of standout games Of course there were a few noteworthy PSX launch games like Twisted Metal Doom and Tekken but for the most part the PSX didnt have anything outstanding yet Thus Resident Evil was made Taking influences from the earlier survival horror series Alone In The Dark Resident evil took all of its aspects to the next level and eventually became one of Capcoms most successful franchises to date ranking just behind the Mega Man and Street Fighter games In fact the original RE game was probably the first PSX game to make the system worthwhile before other important games were released in the following years

  Most everyone whos played the games already knows the story but for those who havent heres a brief synopsis A strange murder occurrence just outside of Raccoon City has caused Police officials to be suspicious so they sent two Special Tactics and Rescue Squad STARS teams to go investigate You play as either Jill Valentine or Chris Redfield both of them surviving STARS members The teams end up getting stuck in the mountains so they eventually find themselves inside a huge mansion where the STARS members discover numerous creatures such as zombies mutilated dogs giant spiders and other monsters These were all created due to Umbrella Corporations disastrous TVirus As the game goes along more important discoveries are made

  Now lets talk about the game itself

  Of the three PSX RE games this one easily has the worst graphics Were talking firstgeneration PSX graphics here if thats any indication The character models are all blocky and easily stick out from the otherwise highly detailed stillscreen environments These environments are navigatably D but the camera angles sit at fixed D points which can be both good and bad depending on the situation By bad I mean that some angles hinder the view of the action The monsters especially the zombies have very limited animation and models compared to the later games and its limited engine prevents the game from having more than  monsters on the screen at one time not including the crows So the only real decent graphical aspects are the rendered environments But even they dont quite compare to the detail in the following games

  The sound effects are good for the most part However the zombies come off sounding more like moaning old men than actual monsters and the voice acting dear god dont get me started Its so hilariously bad that its just fun to listen to The dialogue doesnt help things at all along with the horrible acting which is bad even by Bmovie standards One of my friends almost died of laughter the last time I went through the game The music on the other hand is decent and suits the mood of each area appropriately Its nothing special but it does add to the overall suspense

  The controls are something that most people either love or hate It took me some time to get used to them but now I have no troubles whatsoever Most people that hate them dont seem to realize that RE isnt just an allout action game but rather an exploration puzzle type game with action segments The controls were a bit rough here though they have been more refined in later releases I do admit though that it does get very tedious backtracking to the item box again and again because you cant hold all the items you want to Between the two playable characters Jill and Chris I personally found Jill to be the better one to control because she has more inventory slots and weapons than Chris although Chriss voice acting isnt quite as nervegrating as hers is Both characters each have their own subcharacter that helps them along game such as Barry who helps Jill and Rebecca who aids Chris

  Most people have said that this game was the scariest of all the RE games Im not sure I agree with that but the atmosphere can be quite chilling at certain points I suppose that the dogs breaking through the glass windows couldve scared newbees to the series but since I was introduced through RE and the fact that Ive already played the MUCH freakier Silent Hill games the original didnt scare me nearly as much as it should have To the games credit though it does present the most puzzles and a majority of them are real brainbenders Its something that the series started to get away from as time went on Plus I thought that the game itself felt larger than all the others in the series so it will take a while for new players to beat it The challenge is also very high since there is very limited ammo to take out the creatures with Even veteran RE fanatics still find the first game to be thoroughly challenging enough to come back for more

  This version of the game is a directors cut edition but its really nothing special All we get is an extra mode that is more challenging and features different outfits for the main characters but if you already own the original theres no need to get this version Apparently the Japanese version also had extra cutscenes so we were cheated So much for it being a directors cut huh

  Although this game is extremely dated by todays standards its still worth checking out if youre a big fan of the series and want to see how the series got started in the first place However its not really necessary now that a MUCH better remake is available on the Gamecube so I suggest looking into that game instead RECOMMENDED SPECIFICALLY TO FANS OF THE SERIES NEW FANS SHOULD START WITH RE  OR THE GAMECUBE REMAKE OF THE ORIGINAL FIRSTTHIS IS A LITTLE SUPERIOR TO ITS PLAYSTATION VERSION THE GRAPHICS ARE BETTER THE CONTROLS ARE A LITTLE BETTER AND ITS A LITLE MORE FUN THIS IS A GREAT GAME AND I THINK THIS SHOULD PLEASE ALL MORTAL KOMBAT FANS IF YOU STILL HAVE YOUR NINTENDO  AND YOU DONT HAVE THIS GAME GET IT NOWThe flagship game of Playstation This is what introduced millions of future gamers and PSloyalists that Playstation wasnt messing around when it came to the seriousness that was their gaming system

The gameplay is pretty straight forward You run around D designed levels breaking objects and defeating enemies all the while trying to progress to your archnemsis  Dr Cortex  with the hope of saving your friend

The game was met with great success and spouted off several sequels but for some reason it doesnt really have a presence beyond PS There were hopes and rumors that Crash was once again going to be the flagship game for PS but that wasnt the case

The game although pretty average today set the tone for future launch titles I definitely suggest it if you are a PS historian or enthusiastCapcoms legendary Resident Evil series and I have never really seen eye to eye Though I own nearly every nonGameCube title in the undead thrillers history Id never been able to stand one long enough to actually complete it right up until this past week Id always found the series to be misleading disguising itself as a straightforward action title before slowing the gameplay down to a crawl and relying on endless puzzles and feats of memory to lengthen completion times Time after time Id sit down with the goal of finally tackling these games and time after time Id get bored stuck or distracted leaving the game behind I grabbed Resident Evil  when it was relatively new and the title has sat unplayed on my shelf for years That was as I said until this past week when I sat down with renewed vigor and vowed to complete the first title in the series even if it drove me to madness
Ill make it really blunt the story is absolutely terrible The uninspiring characters meander their way through the events without a care in the world occasionally encountering plot holes large enough to drive an oversized bus through Nagging issues such as why somebody would lock their homes single shotgun away in a room thats only accessible through a string of unrelated tricks and puzzles arent even touched upon What if somebody breaks in in the middle of the night Is the owner of the mansion really going to have time to roll out of bed run downstairs jog to one side of the house move around a couple statues grab a key run to another corner of the house open a door grab a fake shotgun return to the original side of the house unlock the doors and replace the real shotgun with the fake I suppose the story does the right thing by failing to even mention these things but theyll still tug away at the back of your mind as you play
The graphics of the first Resident Evil really havent aged well Humans and zombies alike wander around stiffly and unrealistically each one looking almost identical to the others Polygon models are simple and blocky Textures are pixelated and undetailed looking more like a game assembled on the Super Nintendos SuperFX chip than a PlayStation title The series characteristic prerendered backgrounds are poorly compressed and difficult to navigate in places forcing players to turn out all the lights and squint their eyes just to make their way through the room Merging still images with live polygons Resident Evil plays like a strange amalgamation of the PC classics Myst and Alone in the Dark
The bread and butter of any console title its gameplay is the one area where youll really learn to love or hate this series Rather than bothering with camera angles and awkward environments Capcom has instead sent players through a series of screens occasionally containing interactive elements of their own Youll control Jill or Chris from a series of dramatic angles never in control of the camera itself Theyll enter a screen on the left side mosey around a little bit kill a couple zombies and leave the screen on the right side immediately entering the next screen from another direction Though it was a somewhat novel concept at the time of its release this scheme brought with it numerous problems the most notable of which was your interaction with enemies on the next screen Its not uncommon to run full throttle off the edge of one screen only to find a zombie waiting for you right at the edge of the next Its a really cheap way to take a hit and can mean a speedy frustrating death in later stages
Looking back the control scheme employed here is notably revolutionary Rather than applying a more traditional platformers control layout Resident Evil introduced gamers to a stationary rotationbased configuration Left and right dont serve to strafe they stop the characters movement altogether and rotate them left or right in place Up moves you forward and down moves backwards Pressing R draws your weapon and pressing X at the same time fires Its a scheme thats more appropriate for the kind of stationary gunfighting and marksmanship thats defined the action portions of this series since day one
Many of the tricks and puzzles buried within the mansion arent so much brain teasers as they are time wasters Youll realize what needs to be done within moments but chances are good you wont have the piece needed to do so on your person It took me about six and a half hours to beat the game for the first time as Chris cautiously walking around learning the position of the zombies figuring out the puzzles groaning as I realized the piece I needed was sitting in a chest fifteen minutes away and repeating that process The second time through playing as Jill and remembering which random item I would need where I finished in three hours and twenty minutes Thats one heck of a variation
The soundtrack to the first Resident Evil is really something thats difficult to categorize Imagine if you can a blend of symphonic suspense the song that plays when you push demo on a keyboard and elevator music Thats Resident Evils melody The composer tried to capitalize on the few jump out of your seat moments the storyline provided but surrounded by cheesy samples monotonously repeating tunes and quality that sounds more like something on the N than the PSX there was only so much that could be done
On the large this was a different kind of game than what we were getting at the time something fresh It wasnt a blockbuster ohmygodgetmethesequelnow mind numbing experience I can understand why a game like this would deserve a sequel but even today I couldnt have predicted the amount of games it would spawnWhen it comes to Crash Bandicoot Ill be the first to admit playing the three main games on the PS in reverse order was probably a bad idea The thing is Warped was the only one I had on hand when the urge to play these titles struck and well it completely spoiled me Im sure people are probably sick of me gushing over it but Warped was an excellent product and it was refined to the point of near perfection that I honestly wouldnt hesitate to give it a ten out of ten in conversation or review

The problem with Cortex Strikes Back is it isnt as polished as youd expect I dont mean this in a superficial way like graphic fidelity which is superb for when it was released but a streamline all the cheapshots out of the experience way The level of cheapness ingrained in Crash s gameplay is simply astounding and it comes from a variety of places Things like the hit detection on the belly flop are in dire need of work and the bonus areas are usually the furthest thing from fun when thats the exact opposite of what they should be Worse yet are the games hidden paths which are essentially sorry excuses to throw everything but the kitchen sink at the player The kicker to is just when you think youre done and your guard is down  thats when they throw the kitchen sink at you

The above situation is a real shame because when you get right down to it Cortex Strikes Back is a beautiful game The level design and music are excellent as are the graphics which I feel even give Nintendo  games a run for their money But every time the game turns a corner and those memories of the games stubbornness start to fade something again there is always something shows up and makes it take center stage once again Compounding the situation is the fact there really isnt enough variety in the levels Seriously if I see another level with the words Crash or Bear in it I am going to scream and the same goes for the jet pack levels

Annoyances aside if your a fan of the PlayStation having the three main Naughty Dogdeveloped Crash titles in your library is a nobrainer If you havent played them and want to do yourself a huge favor and play them in order so youll be able to appreciate the improvements each sequel brings with it Unlike some franchises the first three Crash games get better and bolder with each step As for the game being discussed here Crash  leaves a lot to be desired to in my book but then I cant really say I dislike it either I do wish it was a little better polished than where it stands now but then that probably a part of why Warped is so good So while I would definitely warn others of games cheaper side Id still recommend it to anyone with an interest in platformersCrash Bandicoot  Cortex Strikes Back is the second in a long line of Crash Bandicoots This Game is almost totally flawless but hey every game cant be perfect but this game comes damn close

Plot Crash is back kidnapped to help Cortex collect crystals 

Gameplay The Gameplay is what youd expect in a platformer There are five warp rooms with twentyfive levels You have to finish each level by collecting all three crystals for that level If you run out of lives you lose and can return to the last level played 

Sound The sound is very good and has a nice soundtrack 

Graphics The graphics were high quality back in  They still are surprising for todays standards They work and are eye appealing 

Crash Bandicoot  Cortex Strikes Back is one of the best Naughty Dog PlayStation  game Easily put Crash Bandicoot  is WAY better than the first
This Directors Cut is the only version of this game you should own simply because it supports the Analogue joysticks on the Playstation controller The control in the other versions is impossible at times and a bugger to learn if you are a first time player
The game by itself is excellent Lots of puzzles and lots of Zombies to shoot down There are times many of them actually where you much be careful how many zombies you shoot because you can run low on bullets very quickly The story is standard for any Survival Horror game A group of soldiers are locked in an old mansion that is infested with zombies An evil company has eperimented with a chemical that turns people into zombies and the fallout turns the WHOLE TOWN into zombies To survive you must make your way through the mansion and solve all the puzzles This is definitely a challenge and one that can be frustrating at times but rewarding once completed
Here are the pros The graphics are superb The detailing of the zombies and the surroundings give you are real sense of dread and yes the blood flow is well detailed it sprays when you are wounded The music is ominous and ambient giving just the right mood to the situations you come across The story is also well put together even though anyone who has seen George Romeros Living Dead trilogy and what horror fan hasnt can get a sense of deja vu All these elements make this a game well worth getting
Now for the cons This game is not the toughest game for the Playstation but it can be darn frustrating when you get stuck Sometimes a puzzle is very tricky and requires you to backtrack just to see if you missed anything This adds much more time to the game but not in a good way There is also the frustration of running low on bullets when there are three zombies coming towards you Each zombie requires about three bullets each to finish them off but bullets are so scarce that you must conserve Also the acting and dialogue is so hammy that it is comical and you feel compelled to just skip through it so you can get back to killing zombies
Overall this is a great game with a few shortcomings But then again nothing is perfect If the Survival Horror concept sounds appealing then you should check this one out The Resident Evil series has become the benchmark of Survival Horror much like Final Fantasy has for the RPG genreThis is where the epic Resident Evil series began The first adventure sees you tackle zombies snakes and dogs in a deserted mansion which is very atmospheric Dont be put off by the relatively poor voice acting and cut scenes bear in mind that this was made in  and so for the times its pretty good This is a classic game that spawned one of the best series of games on the Playstation The only thing preventing this from being a  star game is the slighty disapointing ending But this is only a minor flaw and this is still one of the best games on the PlaystationSince last night Ive been waiting to do this review because Ive been studying the exact differences from RE and RE Directors Cut This review will really help for someone who has played RE but is wondering what RE DC is about Well youve came to the right place  First of all here are the facts
 Each zombie takes  shots NO MATTER WHAT with the Beretta
 Jill is a blonde all though she doesnt look like it a very dumb blonde
 BARRY HAS A MAGNUM AND HES PROUD
 You have to kill zombies up to four times if you leave the room when you shoot them down that means they come back alive once they are dead and you leave the roomthe just pop up
 This game has hilarious dialogue
  Well speaking of dialogue the grammar is also very badand I mean VERY bad Examples are when you pick up the st floor map  You got the st floor map  RE says youve taken the st floor map that makes more sense  You got the acid roundsfunny sometimes Also what I found is that Jill doesnt know what blood is Barry is inspecting a pool of red liquid on the dining room floor Jill comes over and has the nerve to ask What is it and she stays there and studies it Barry replies with I THINK it is blood I hope this is not Chriss blood  And they have exaggeration at the completely wrong times But when there is a big monster coming they just talk wow its a monster what do we do  and when there is like a door that doesnt open during movie scenes they say THIS DOOR WONT OPEN WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO Also a really hilarious part is when Barry hands Jill the acid rounds Jill says that he should keep them for himself and Barry replies No thats okayI have THIS And holds up his MagnumI laughed my head offhe sounded so stupid No offence to the makers of RE or anything but it is just so funny
  Another fact is that the camera angles are bad but the puzzles are harder Hmmm Resident Evil is a very very very good gamebut it is just the dialogue and camera anglesive been talking it down but now its time to tell you that it is DEFINATELY worth getting despite its happy mediums
So theres a few final things I have to say here
 Barry has a magnum  Wesker has shades  And the three zombies at the top of the stairs above the M Storeroom F sound like cows
  Cheers JonglesThis game is great It has so many improvements as opposed to the first game In this game you can high jump crawl slide ride on a jetboat and fly with a jetpack Its a huge adventure starring the Bandicoot The main challenge of the game is to get  percent by collecting gems and crystals The level isnt officially complete until you get the crystal Oh and you are gonna need a memory card because this game is fairly big Unless youre a really hardcore game then you wont need it but its recommended In conclusion this is a fantastic game and if you love this make sure you get Crash Bandicoot  WarpedGood silicone protective for the price Fits well on the joystick
I extremelly recomend it since its up to taskThis squeal to the original Crash Bandicoot game lives up to its name With great gameplay levels and new characters youll be setting in front of the TV for a whileWhen the first Crash Bandicoot came out in  I was amazed on an old game and game system could have great D graphics and such great game play but it was kind hard But in this one its not as hard because you can crouch slide and crouch jump so you can jump even higher But the graphics are more cartoonish then they are on the first one But this one had some levels I liked better than on the first one YOU SHOULD PLAY THIS GAMEIt doesnt hold up to time but I cant blame it for that I honestly bought this for my wife She said this game was a big part of her childhood So I decided to buy it she couldnt get past the first stage and then she gave up and its been home to dust and lint I know this isnt a review and more of a rant but its a solid platformer from the pastLets go back in time to one of my favorite PlayStation icons Crash Bandicoot For those who dont know Crash Bandicoot is a fictional Eastern Barred Bandicoot who was genetically enhanced by the evil Doctor Neo Cortex who then escaped and set out to stop the evil scientist and his plans Crash would appear in many games but the ones I hold dear are the original three on the first PlayStation Crash Bandicoot Crash Bandicoot  Cortex Strikes Back and Crash Bandicoot  Warped With that said lets take a look at the first one in the series

The first Crash Bandicoot game was released way back in  with Naughty Dog developing the game Sony Computer Entertainment publishing it and Universal Interactive Studios being the distributors It was a PlayStation exclusive but would eventually get rereleased as a PS One Classic on the PlayStation Store to be played on the PlayStation  The game is definitely kid friendly and appropriate for all ages Crash Bandicoot is basically a Mario ripoff but a very good one none the less who came up with several original ideas The story goes that Crash Bandicoot was created by Doctor Neo Cortex and his henchmen Doctor Nitrus Brio Crash escapes the experiments but leaves his girlfriend Tawna in the process and Crash is swept up to an island and sets out to go rescue her and stop the villains Whats weird is that this is the only Crash Bandicoot game on the PlayStation in which Tawna appears in I dont know why though its definitely unusual But nonetheless lets continue with the game

The first thing that stands out are the graphics the graphics for  looked fantastic they were even better than Super Mario  on Nintendo  which was released a month later It definitely gets an A for presentation The game was a huge hit and was the first nonJapanese game to achieve commercial success in the country Now lets discuss the actual gameplay

The game is nonetheless a platformer in which you control Crash Bandicoot across three islands to defeat Doctor Cortex and rescue your girlfriend The game is split into levels with one basic goal get to the end without dying You start out with four lives and its one hit deaths from being touched by enemies or falling into water or a pit Yeah its weird how water kills Crash even though he fell in the water at the introduction and was floating away to one of the islands and survived Why is it that these characters who are very athletic cant figure out how to swim I hate games that do this because when you see water youre never sure if the game will allow you to swim Its stupid and whats weird is that in the third game Crash does swim underwater with scuba gear So really the game is a huge contradiction of itself

You can get more one ups by finding them across levels or collecting  apples which are basically the coins of Super Mario Bros but the apples are everywhere in this game so its really easy to get a one up you could literally get at least three lives per level Attack moves include jumping in the air and landing on an enemy or using a spin move in a tornado fashion to knock enemies offscreen I like that even if its a ripoff of Super Mario World You also find this Mask that helps you on your journey if you find it it gives you an extra hit point but you dont actually wear the mask it just follows you If you get three masks without losing one you turn invincible for a brief time much like the Starmans in Super Mario Bros

The boxes are also a ripoff of Super Mario Bros in which they have question marks on them and you have to destroy the boxes to gain prizes But not all boxes are the same there are boxes without question marks arrow boxes that propel you in the air boxes with exclamation marks which makes boxes appear out of nowhere checkpoint boxes that act as a save spot for the level and TNT boxes which explode after three seconds when you jump on them whatever you do dont spin attack them because they will immediately explode

A strange feature in these boxes is that you can get Tawna tokens that act as a bonus level so you can get some extra fruit and one ups Whats weird is that Tawna is in this level but she doesnt let you rescue her for some odd reason but whats even stranger is that completing the bonus level is the only way to save the game or get a password I dont understand why early PlayStation games didnt allow you to save anytime you want Every video game that can support a memory card should do that I hate writing down passwords so I can continue But the password is only eight digits and the main buttons on the PlayStation controller act as the characters so its at least not a long and annoying password

If you complete an entire level without losing a life and manage to destroy all the boxes youll get rewarded with a gem this was a flaw with the game because it makes the game way too damn hard and every future Crash Bandicoot game let you get the gem even if you die as long as you break all the crates Some gems can act as platforms to help you get across areas that are impossible to reach much like the vine in Super Mario Bros

Now while this game has some flaws its still a good game overall its not as good as the second and third game but its definitely fun and enjoyable The creativity is good has a good challenge and the graphics are fantastic If you have a PlayStation Network account give this game a chance its only  on the PlayStation Store so its not expensive or anything Its definitely a classic

FINAL RATING   out of This is one of my favorite games from the playstation series When it first came out in  needless to say I was blown away by the D directional jumping It was my first playstation game Of course there were some issues that I had with the game but it was the first of its kind and it paved the way for improvements Some reviews have said how the game is hard I agree to a point I started playing it when I was in th grade and I still have a copy today but at that time it was a new concept to grasp playing a game with D controls versus simpler D controls from the Nintendo or Sega But after a while and many Bandicoots being eaten crushed boiled in acid drowning or falling into dark abysses I came out on top There are some levels that are still difficult for me Lights Out for example but I relish in the challenge it brings

Too hard for young kids some people say So was the original Mario Bros from  at one point Ignoring secret jumping techniques with turtle shells lives were hard to come by and you definitely needed them for the later worlds In Crash Bandicoot they practically give lives away because the levels are fairly challenging throughout the game For example Boulder Dash wiped out the  some lives I had accumulated the first time got to that level

I agree with other people about the way that you save in that it is kind of annoying but we take that for granted today anyway In prior games like Mario  if you got a game over it was back to the beginning of the world you died in In this game its back to the last level you were at before you saved Maybe the creators were trying to make it a challenging game by doing it that way In that I say they succeeded

For a platform gamer this game has a nice blend of D motion with D side scrolling in a colorful environment that was pretty good visually for the graphics at the time It definitely took you to a different world The music for the various levels was appropriate and entertaining Come on remember Hog Wild Good times riding that boar It had a very linear type of progression but it was not too unlike Super Mario World with the coin shaped levels on the overworld map The bonus rounds were indeed difficult but you could always replay them minus the saving bonuses once you saved and never lose lives in the bonus rounds Aku aku was there in my time of need especially when toxic barrels were bouncing my way He is a different but unique take on the power ring or mushroom flower star buffs from the other iconic heroes I am not saying Crash Bandicoot is better than other platform games before him but he is unique and has his own style that improved in the titles that came after I give this game a  out of  or  starsCrashs st game as I reviewed is my favortie debut game but his sequel blows me away  Theres one reviewer who says this is an improvement on the original with some sassy style  Theyre  correct  The games best improvements and worst flaws are all I will list because you already know where I stand if youve read my review on the st game and go check it out if you havent

Best Improvement Saving System  This allows you to save at anytime so youre not going to have to get off becuase your parents said so of course without saving all your hard and handy work and having to have to do it all over again

nd Best Improvement You have  levels to choose from at anytime  You dont have to go in order

rd Best Improvement More moves  Crash is looking good with all his new stunts

th Best Improvement Vehicles  Crash gets to drive some neato vehicles including my favorite the jet pack

th Best Improvement Greater and better bosses including N Gin

th Best Improvement Bigger Better and More secret levels

th Best New characters  Im lovin the new addition of characters including Coco Bandicoot Crashs sister whom I think shouldve been in the st game

th Best Improvement Its easier to collect gems and theres a new addition crystals

Worst Flaw Well it would be nice if Tawna hadnt suddenly disappeared  I think she shouldve been crucial to the entrtie series not just the st game

nd Worst Flaw You cant revisit bosses without a secret code  You should be able to revisit bosses without having to have to look for secret codes to do so

So those are all the improvements and flaws  As you can see better the the st game by farThis game is really fun I love everything about it besides having to search the worlds sometimes to find all the levels but its part of the game and it does help add to when you defeat it If you love games like Crash Bandicoot Mario Zelda or anything related youll probably really like this gameLet me just say that this game looks cool but in case you dont know what this game is about read this okay N cortex is back to save the world And he is asking his rival Crash Or is this something to trick Crash Find out in Crash Bandicoot This game has everything the first part lacked It has even better graphics This was the first one of the crash series I tried and it was fun Before that I was hooked on fighting games like street fighters and tekken but they are not that fun after playing it a  times or so In this game you can spend as much time without losing interest
It is more or less like the first part There is akuaku boxes to crash gems more difficult new bosses after each floor And by the by this game is divided into  floors each floor with  doors each door with a different adventure You can finish the game like I did the first time without collecting gems but it is not that fun Hint If you break all the boxes of one level you are rewarded a gem There are hidden levels for some gems you would have to consult the internet for it Good luck in that
In this part you can save after each level it is easier in that respect I find the gems easier to collect than in the first forbidding game The designs of the adventure is by far better than the firs
The story line is change a little bit Instead of the Pamela Anderson of a lover Crash had he gets a more geeky Meg Ryan of a sister Dr Cortex is still missing things up The assistant from the first part does not appear except when he tries to communicate Crash to warn him from Cortex You want to know more Get the gems first
There is also a sixth hidden floor You would have to reach it by a trick and again check the net for that
The game was the best I have ever tried It makes my life harder since I cannot find better games to play anymore It will make you look for other adventures of Crashafter falling from ballon cortex will crash into a dark cave which cantains power now crash is heading into five warp rooms and new bosses like tinykomodo bros and ngin now crash can even fly in the jet packCrash Bandicoot  Cortex Strikes Back was a large step up from the first part This games graphics music gameplay and even story were much better than in the first But its kind of weird how Crash Bandicoot doesnt end up staying with Tawna Bandicoot and instead ends up living with his little sister Coco Bandicoot Well at least Coco has the ability to speak unlike her big brother The voice acting changed dramatically as well and for the betterDr Neo Cortexs new voice was much cooler and evilsounding If you liked the first Crash game get this one Although its more difficultespecially in gathering Crystals and Gems its really funThis is not the first one of these I have had in fact this is about my th There are many different skin types and different skin makers so you have to judge each on its own merit My controller skin arrived today well ahead of expected delivery just as described solid black and silicone Fit is just perfect and installation had no problems Good comfortable smooth texture while still providing a much better grip than on the hard slick controller plastic I like to clean my game equipent regularly and I always clean even new items before using This is a great way to test the quality of the item I cleaned the skin using isopropanal alchohol no gumming like you get with lower grade skinsand no color bleed onto the rag this tells me it is definitly silicone not some rubber stuff Once on the controller grip is good comfort is good feel is natural I am very pleased with this controller skin I have been needing to get one for my extra controller I will definitly be ordering a few more later a friend has a birthday coming upThis game has lots of advantages The last game was goodbut this one is better The reason I gave it a four star rading is because its hard Its possible to do it without the guidebut impossible without a memory card But you can like it A good buyI remember when I first got this game with a Playstation console in early  It was a great phenomenon then because the Crash Bandicoot series was able to bring some new life to the platforming genre of gaming with its D and D interchangeable levels

Crash must go through  levels and  bosses in this game but unlike the later games in the series Crash must tackle the levels chronologically by progressively going through  islands

While the gameplay is fun and interesting the game has its flaws as well First off you can only save when you either complete a bonus round which can only be access one time in each level or when you collect a gem for destroying every crate in the level This gets frustrating because in order to get each gem you must complete the level and break the boxes without losing a life plus the fact that colored gems are required to complete certain levels If I were you I wouldnt worry about the box gems just yet and just try to find the bonus in the newer level you are at if you want to call it a day You may have to do the newer level again which tends to be a flaw

Despite this I highly recommend this for fans of previous platforming games like Donkey Kong Country and Sonic the Hedgehog While the series would improve this is not a bad startThis is a classic game that I come back to every now and again The graphics are great and the content is really satisfying But I do have a complaint of the actual difficulty of the game

st island  The easiest to beat if you have all of the different coloured gems The hardest level here is Native Fortress

nd island  Slightly harder but still fun The hardest level here is Sunset Vista

rd island  The most frustrating I spent half an hour to beat Generator Room with Perfect and another half an hour with Toxic Waste The hardest level here is Slippery Climb

I dont get why a kids game can get difficult to beat I mean I own mature games like Jak  and Oblivion and they are a whole lot easier by comparison If you are looking for a challenging game this is your cup of tea But if you want a kids game that you can just glide through I recommend SpyroHave had this skin for almost  months and so far there are no signs of wear or tear which is good Its sticky just enough to be grippy but not overly so It protects the controller fairly well Keeps it from getting dirty as fast especially if you have a white controller

Overall it feels good and is comfortable even in long play periods The only problem I have is there is annoying little piece up by the triggers on both sides Its right in between the trigger and the bumper buttons and there is no tension on the piece so when you switch between the bumper and triggers it can sometimes flip up and your finger will catch it Not really a deal breaker or a big deal or anything since I plan on cutting it off anyways Plan on buy another so far after this one falls apart Will update my review if it doesnt last longCrash Bandicoots my favorite video game character and all his work is genius  Im looking forward to his latest video game installment Crash Tag Team Racing  The games graphics are good the gameplay itself sounds amuzing and the trailer on GameSpot prove how visually stunning its going to be too  But Crashs humble beginning is not the same as Mario and Sonics were  It was much better more creative and bigger

Marios was just an arcade game  It was hard but it didnt take to long to master it and I dont even know if there was a boss  Sonics debut was better then Marios  A game you could play without spending money good levels challenging better bosses and a special ending you could view if you collected all the items necessary  But these debuts lacked what Crashs had  Most challenging best bosses better secret ending and most of all a D world to play in

Crashs world is not fully D in this game in fact up till Crash Twinsanity none of them have been but it is very good as far as it goes  The VIRTUAL world looks like the REAL world  Thats one of the games strongest points  The controls are very solid and Crash responds amazingly well to your commands  This spoiled me  Id play a Crash game and then go play something else with looser controls and be upset by the lack of response  I became versatile after a while though  Crash lacks moves in this game but he has more then Sonic andor Mario had in their debut games  Crash has  Mario and Soinc only had   Crashs moves are running jumping and spinning  The spinnig move is an extremely creative thing  To make up for Sonics spin Naughty Dog brought out the bigger and better guns  Crashs spin is much easier to control and is much more effective  It also doesnt threaten you in a strange almost indescribable way  Sonics spin reqired that you dash in the direction that you were facing before you started spinning  Sega called this the spin dash  This could throw you to your death  Not Crashs  Crash could move or stay still when spinning  Note Soinc didnt have the spin dash in his debut game  Mario and Sonics jumping Ill admit was better  They were tighter then Crash  Their direction could be changed much much easier then Crash when jumping  Crash jumps higher though  Crash runs kind of slow especially when you need to get something done But hes slower in Crash Twinsanity  Crashs camera control is hardly ever a problem  Every once in a while youll have to strain your eye a little but its still a better camera then Soincs  Marios is best out of all though cause you could see the entire level all at once

As for the other features of the game theyre pretty outstanding  The levels are big and challenging  Theres also secret levels in Crash  Ive never seen anything like that in Sonic  or Donkey Kong have you  No I didnt think so  Crashs biggest flaw is the saving system  In the game you must collect  tokens of Crashs girfriends head hidden in the level to get to a bonus area  You must get to the end of the Tawna Crashs girlfriends name is Tawna Bonus Round touch Tawna whos just standing there and then exit the Tawna Bonus Round via a warp pad in order to save  If you dont do exactly what I said had to be done in order to save you dont get to save Not fair at all  But its still better then Sonic  or Donkey Kong cause you cant save at all in those games  There are also two other kinds of bonus rounds in the game The Cortex main bad guy of the game Bonus Rounds and the Brio Cortexs righthand man Bonus Rounds  You cant save in these bonus rounds even if you get to the end of them without falling off the platforms  Oh and get this there arent Tawna Bonus Rounds in all the levels so you dont have a chance to save if your parents tell you to get off and youre in a level like Hog Wild where theres no bonus rounds  Big flaw  The nd biggest flaw is the way you have to collect gems  In the game you must collect  I think dont quote me on that number because Im not sure gems in order to see the secret ending  However its a little too hard to collect them all  I understand most people think the games not hard enough but I think its a little too hard  To collect a gem you must destroy every single crate in a level and get to the end without losing a life  Im all for destroying every crate but I think you should be able to lose a life and still get the gem  It should only matter if you destroy all the boxes

So if youre wanting to compare Mario and Sonic to Crash Id say Crash all the way  And as you can see if youre reading this Crashs st game was much better then Mario and Sonics  I say Crash is best no matter what anyone else tells meAlright so I just used naughty for the play on the company name but it got your attention aparently so

This is the oldest Naughty Dog title Ive played as far as I know however it has a lot of the issues which Ive noticed from their games in the past  Nasty difficulty spikes the eight or so level should be closer to the end and the one path to the end of a platformer standard which Super Mario World truely broke when it came out take the one star out of this otherwise superb game

While the graphics are fantastic for PS and moderate at worst for PS sometimes I find it hard to tell where exactly Crash is going to land  Also this very much D platformer has side scrolling sections where I become convinced that pressing down will make crash duck not fall into a bottomless pit water or whatever else is in the foreground  Saving can sometimes prove difficult although if you look in the right places you can find a way to save after every significant area  Also often after completing certain difficult areas youll be able to do them again at any point you desire good for getting the games bonuses

I havent finished the game yet Im only half way through so anything in this review could change although its unlikely  Most Naughty Dog games are consistantly good or bad in every way

Anyway the bonuses are usually earned by getting through a level opening EVERY box in the level without losing a single life  Others are given through bonus levels etc

A very great game for a great priceI tried the Crash  PlayStation game about  and it was delightful It was in fact so delightful that I looked around for the first part to start from the proper point
When I started playing the first part I was disappointed by the difference of the story but still It was a nice game
The graphics are excellent The story is original It speaks about a genetically engineered dog named Crash that resembles human beings This genetic procedure was done by Dr Cortex or more precisely by his degraded assistant Then Dr Cortex goes on the produce a new female version of this Crash Of course crash falls in love with her Dr Cortex being a wicked soul parts between the two and then Crash needs to go through so many obstacles to reach his lover
So many levels are divided into islands and each set of levels is followed by a bad boss Some are hard and some are easy It depends in your skill in such games The story is concluded by a battle between this Crash and Dr Cortex If you win then you got it
And to complicate life even more the designers introduced the concept of gaining gems If you get all the gems you can continue the game in a new fashion I aint saying it cause I dont want to spoil things for you To attain these gems is a difficult task As for me I got them but after being kicked in the teeth for it You should not even dream of getting the gems in order of levels No mon ami some times you have to go to a certain advanced level to get a green gem for instance to get the gem in the say fourth level You would have to check the net for the tricks dirty if I may and the hidden places Good luck in that
There is akuaku which is a mask that is considered as an extra life if you get touched by any of the enemies Take  akuakus and you become invincible for some seconds and you kill any of the enemies by a mere touch
Of course there are saving stations You do not get to save after every level This is a drawback Saving stations are also level you have to jump crush step on dynamite and so on If you fall down you cannot save you have to go to the next saving station It is hare I am telling you
The game is great and if you win with a  percent then you are the man
Crash   Stars
The Best Game Ever
This game has everything the first part lacked It has even better graphics This was the first one of the crash series I tried and it was fun Before that I was hooked on fighting games like street fighters and tekken but they are not that fun after playing it a  times or so In this game you can spend as much time without losing interest
It is more or less like the first part There is akuaku boxes to crash gems more difficult new bosses after each floor And by the by this game is divided into  floors each floor with  doors each door with a different adventure You can finish the game like I did the first time without collecting gems but it is not that fun Hint If you break all the boxes of one level you are rewarded a gem There are hidden levels for some gems you would have to consult the internet for it Good luck in that
In this part you can save after each level it is easier in that respect I find the gems easier to collect than in the first forbidding game The designs of the adventure is by far better than the firs
The story line is change a little bit Instead of the Pamela Anderson of a lover Crash had he gets a more geeky Meg Ryan of a sister Dr Cortex is still missing things up The assistant from the first part does not appear except when he tries to communicate Crash to warn him from Cortex You want to know more Get the gems first
There is also a sixth hidden floor You would have to reach it by a trick and again check the net for that
The game was the best I have ever tried It makes my life harder since I cannot find better games to play anymore It will make you look for other adventures of CrashThis is definitely one of the best games you can find Crash a bandicoot as his name applies is out to rescue his girlfriend Tawna from his arch nemesis the evil Dr Cortex There are about  levels in the whole game to go through in which range from extremely easy to almost impossible The game is probably the hardest of all the Crash games so anybody who wants a challenge is in for a treat The graphics range In some the graphics will have you staring and in some you just plain will not be impressed but Im not saying anything about that This game has a high amount of replay value as well and for some levels you will need strategy The only reason I gave this  stars is because of the horrible save system You can only save if you get to Tawna bonus rounds common and complete them not too difficult or collect a Gem medium difficulty to almost impossible If you can overlook the save system then youve got yourself a great gamePlays great The box had a crack in it though Im asuming that was just from shipping Other than that it came with the art manual and even the ad page that advertises other Naughty Dog gamesI got a great deal on this used PS game My girlfriend plays this classic game and enjoys it a lot Shes not much of a gamer The disc seems to be in great condition with no scratches and plays perfectly Theres a few tiny cracks within the inner ring of the disc but this is common and DOES NOT affect the actual disc itself It seems like an alright game to me just not my style which is why I gave it a  But a lot of people seem to like this game Its a great kids game as wellCrash Bandicoot is one of my oldest games on my oldest system the Playstation Still I have never grown tired of playing levels which used to be challenges that now I pass with a breeze The levels are awe inspiring Water is flowing without a crack the jungle is incredibly lush and the characters have no mistakes from their hair to their sneakers Story is interesting tooyou have to save Crashs girlfriend Tawna from Dr Neo Cortex The only disadvantage is the limited controlsjump and spin This game brought two sequels and two other games that involve racing and mini games No wonderThis was a fun D platform adventure game  Croc may look cute and easy to play but It was definitely challenging even for veteran video game players  The game is very bright with colorful backgrounds with lots of stomping and jumping on crates and boxes  The boss fights were very well done and exciting  The controls took a little bit of getting used to but the gameplay overall was responsive and fun  The game is appropriate for all ages and the bonus levels are fun and interesting

The game does take some strategy and you have to be very quick in several parts of the game  It is in the same spirit of the Mario  game but not as polished or well refined  The camera angles do make it hard to maneuver Croc in some parts of the game which add to the challenge  The replay value is pretty high  I spent a lot of time playing this game trying to get the  percent to make it to the true boss of the game  It provided hours of fun as well as a lot of frustration but overall it was a very rewarding experience  The game should be fairly cheap now the game had a battery pack save feature which saved your progress on the memory card  If your looking for something a little bit different than Mario this is a nice game to try out

Overall I would rate it a solid  stars its not a perfect platformer but the game was made with a lot of care the developers did a really good job  Collecting all the Gobbos is fun but some of the stages will drive you nutsGraphics   These are often stunning but at times a bit murky Mostly they are really fabulous to look at though in every scene the makers of Crash have put in a lot of effort
Sound   The animals couldve made some more sounds but the creatures that talk do it clearly and well Mostly the score is playing in the background so there isnt much sound to be heard
Value   Value for money indeed Once youve finished youll want to start all over again
Overall   Great game with an excellent reputation Crash  and  surpass it slightly but this is still an easyonthebrain fun and original ideaWhen I got this for my early birthdayI didnt expect that the character would be so cute Crash is adorablewhich will get you hooked on for about an hourthe fun for anotherand the hard for minus a second Even though it is difficultyoull enjoy looking in those eyesand playingI love this game Back when I was eight years old I got this on PC and played this game until it became muscle memory Playing this on PS is even more fun thanks to the benefit of a controller

I looked up reviews for this game and I was surprised to see it blasted by many reviewers They claimed it was too easy or too hard and painfully awkward to control That is not the case It is actually a very smart game that teaches you how to play in the first level without a single word of dialog or a single segment of text

My four year old cousin can pick this up and play it easily thanks to the intuitive design The music is fun The controls are smooth And the game is just simply fun

There is little completion bonus with only challenge maps and an extra boss as a reward But the levels are fun an memorable The volcanic levels snow levels desert levels and castle levels are extremely fun and exciting

Get this for young gamers or people who like playing platformer gamesWhatever happened to the days when games were made to be fun  Whatever happened to the days where replay value was through the roof and graphics were not as heavily emphasized This game is well over  years old now and it is still fun to play  Even in this day and age I see kids enjoying it  This should be one of those games that developers look back upon and say what made that game so much fun  What can we learn from this aside from improving upon the old school D graphics  Spyro may not be the best game of all time but it certainly is a fun one for me that I have had a lot of fond memories playingThis game is a lot of fun The environments are adorable and the gameplay is a lot of fun There is quite a bit of stuff to do and the game is kind of challenging My only problem is the movement is a little goofy feeling at first but you will get used to itI played Croc  more often but I did play Croc Legend of the Gobbos when I was young  These games were so fun as well as difficult I never managed to get  completion on either of them  The controls are a bit stiff but this did release in  so that should be expected  The game is quite difficult and the story itself is quite simple but the game is fun nonetheless and for me its a pretty timeless classic that I am happy to add to my collection of childhood memories and video games  Definitely worth the moneyIll recommend Spyro to anyone fun enemies and worlds and awesome concepts Graphics arent the best of course but the gameplay is so addicting collecting gems and freeing your fellow dragons Musthave for a Playstation  collectionNever having played a spyro game before I figured Id start with the first one which I downloaded off the Playstation Network on PS  At first I was turned off by the camera control and graphics but once I realized how fun the game was it was no longer a problem  I did everything in the game for  in a matter of days as I found it to be very addicting

The gameplay consists of exploring a few hub worlds which are connected to various levels where you must free dragons collect diamonds and defeat the bad guys  Some levels include full flight which adds some much needed variety to the core gameplay  The boss battles were the weakest part as they didnt really stand out and were pretty tame  Games nowadays are so complex that it was a pleasure to play something so simple  Running around colorful worlds collecting multicolored diamonds and discovering secret areas are always a good time and Spyro is the purest form of these ideas

The simplicity of the gameplay combined with the variety in worldslevels ensured it never got boring  Just pure light hearted funThis memory card works but i have to take it out and put it back in every time i turn the system off otherwise it wont readI liked this game In my mind this really isnt a Kids game though to beat the game  actually requires alot of time and effort Its more the type of game you can play and kids will watch The controls are pretty easy its basically MARIO but your a crocodile exploring diffrent levels theres really nothing groundbreaking

The game does keep your attention and you will have fun completing the levels A good game if your a patient person if not youll wonder why its taking you so long to beat thiskids game and make you feel stupidSpyro the Dragon the game that SHOULD have been Sonys mascot instead of Crash Bandicoot

The original Spyro the Dragon is probably the best platformadventure game you can find for the Playstation  I cant give Spyros first adventure a star rating though  Lets get the problems out of the way before moving on to the positive things about Spyro and believe me theres a LOT of good things about this game

People have compared Spyro the Dragon to everything from Crash Bandicoot to BanjoKazooie to Nights and who knows what else  Well I think the first Spyro game is JUST as good as all those games  In fact Spyro the Dragon is better than the first Crash Bandicoot game  Now THERES a game that disappointed me  Spyro came out of nowhere and RULED right from the beginning  I never would have guessed back in  that Spyro would have went on to become a classic

Spyros debut does have a few problems though  Seeing as how this is Spyros very first adventure I wont be TOO harsh  Am I the only one who thinks the play control could have been better  Its not that I have a tough time controlling Spyro  Well to be honest I DID have trouble controlling him at first  Spyro doesnt QUITE take off when you hit up down left or right on the directional pad  Theres a split second delay before moving forward  Maybe the creators of the game thought this was part of the realism since after all youre moving a DRAGON  A BIG creature like a dragon wont move forward right away  Then again Spyro is small compared to the dragons you have to rescue

Controlling Spyro was definitely a problem for me at first  For example attempting to properly jump on top of the three round platforms you encounter at the very beginning of the first world was NOT an easy task  I kept sliding off  By the way I recommend you take advantage of these round platforms to get to know the controller  Master the controller before exploring the world  This will cut down on any possible frustration you may encounter in the future

I have to consider that my inability to control Spyro may have been due to the camera angles  Even though the camera in this game is drastically better than many other games you have to admit it isnt flawless either  If you hit Pause and go to the options you will see an option for a second camera view called active  This view is better because the camera immediately follows behind Spyro at ALL times  The other default camera view is more of a hassle trying to figure out where youre moving and you cant get a good view of what lies ahead  You may want to change it to active if the other camera view is difficult for you  Thank goodness for this option

Some people have a problem with the lack of challenge  While its completely true you wont have much trouble making it to the end of any stage in the game prepare to die  or  times in each stage before you understand exactly what you have to do and where you have to jump  I think the most challenging thing about Spyro the Dragon are the times you have to jump onto a faraway platform and many times you just BARELY make it  Many times you will fall to your death  Be patient though  The game NEVER messes with you by throwing in any impossible jumps  Sometimes its about finding just the right spot to jump and glide and if youre off just a little bit you wont make it  The creators of Spyro are smart not to make the game frustrating seeing as how its supposed to be a game for the entire family  Good work

The biggest challenge comes at the very end of the game when you face the main boss  Hes really easy to beat however GETTING to him is a whole other story  You see right at the very end before you face him you have to jump over a series of disappearing platforms and if you fall and you WILL fall the first few times because its hard you will land in burning lava and have to do the whole stage over again  Not that the stage is really that long anyway but this is by FAR the hardest part of the game  The other  of the game only offers a slight challenge here and there

With that said dont be fooled into thinking the game will be a cakewalk because of all the easy obstacles found throughout World One  It DOES get harder  You see many of the enemies you face in the later levels can only be defeated by either smacking them with your head or shooting fire at them  You wont know which of these tricks will be most effective on them until you face the enemy and experiment  You also have to dodge fireballs swordswipes dogs jumping at you and tons of other enemy attacks WHILE you try to find the best way to defeat them  So its not pathetically easy after all

A minor complaint is that sometimes while youre walking or running the path will suddenly end and youll fall to your death  Doesnt happen often but I thought it would be worth mentioning

I hate the way Spyro talks  He sounds like a bratty teenage rebel with a nasally voice  Not exactly what a dragons voice should sound like  Also when you rescue the dragons sometimes they say important things you might want to pay attention to  The problem here is that many times the important tips they say arent really helpful because they say them right AFTER youve already had to do them  For instance in one case after you glide to a faraway platform and rescue a dragon the dragon will tell you how to glide  Obviously since I needed to glide in order to rescue him I already KNOW how to glide  So I didnt NEED his help  This happens a few times during the game  You just want to scream Thanks for nothing bonehead

The music was done by a member of the rock band the Police Stewart Copeland  People may not realize it but certain themes in Spyro the Dragon are very close to some of the songs that made the Police such a legendary rock band  Stewart Copeland may have intentionally created the music in this game to match that of the Police specifically the songs walking on the moon and message in a bottle  Youll soon realize that the same guy who created the music in this game also played a big part in creating those Police songs  The music in Spyro the Dragon is also very catchy and appropriate for the level youre in  No complaints  The music is fantastic

I think the creators made a mistake  When you hit L the camera rotates clockwise and R makes the camera rotate counterclockwise  It should be the other way around  Another thing that needs reversed the way Spyro flies in the bonus stages  When you press up you fly down  When you press down you fly up  Strange mistake  This makes it harder to complete the flying stages however you dont have to finish them

In fact despite what people may tell you you do not have to collect ALL the gems and ALL the dragons  Finding and collecting all the gems and dragons will only give you a better percentage and open up a bonus stage at the end of the game  The gameplay in Spyro the Dragon can actually be compared to Yoshis Island you dont have to find everything but doing so will open up rewards and give you an overall better score  The creators did a fantastic job hiding gems and dragons increasing the challenge  More often than not you will see a treasure chest or a dragon statue up high on a platform and not have a single clue how to reach it  Its fun to run around and think about how to reach it  Some of them are cleverly located  One word to describe it awesome

Anyway Spyro the Dragon is tons of fun and may possibly remind you of a D Donkey Kong Country what with TNT barrels and the jungle levels you encounter later on  Spyro is much better than that overrated Crash Bandicoot game and you should pick up Spyro the Dragon todayThis game is a really good game There is a good storyline to it and challenging But isnt Spyros best Its a good game in the endNot boring not geat either I like how they have designed it and how good the graphics are but this isnt the best out of the three I prefered the  nd most but really enjoyed the  rd too If you are looking for a lot of adventure try out this BRILLThe is the first Spyro game and it paved the road for all the other Spyro games The story When the evil Nasty Norc turns all of the dragons into statues its up to Spyro a small purple dragon to set them free and defeat Nasty Norc You travel with Sparx your dragonfly companion and also your health gage as you collect gems and go through six gigantic worlds with over  levels in all This game is great although its not very challenging it offers hour of entertainment My favorite world is the Beast Makers world Its a creepy place and almost all the levels in it take place at nighttime which to me is the best type of level in Spyro My favorite is Tree Tops because it is a gigantic level that gives you that creepy feeling even the music is creepy in its own way Another minor flaw in this game is that it has no minigames in it Those always provide extracurricular fun but Im happy to say that they are introduced in a later Spyro release Id recommend this game today if you dont already have it If you not into Spyro this is the place to start atThat said the game is really fun Not too hard that you rent it and after a while throw the controller down in frusterationnot too easy that you breeze through it No there are gems to collect and characters to meet This was the beginning of Spyro He only got better and better in future games Check this one out first though or itll drive you crazyeverything improves SO much in the next gameDid I mention how CUTE Spyro isI love this game  The characters are cute they make great noises and there are lots of worlds to explore  Its really hard to die too so you could concievably play without a memory card  What I dont like about it is that Spyro is a little hard to control compared to todays games and a lot of parts are highly frustrating  Thieves have stolen a bunch of dragon eggs and you have to chase them down and get the eggs back but this is MUCH easier said than done  I have spent hours chasing these guys on some levels  I mean I wouldnt want the game to be too easy but this is borderline ridiculous  But its still a really great game and I absolutely fell in love with it  Id recomend it to people who love cute things and have infinite patienceSpyro the Dragon was the game I got right after its sequel Spyro  Riptos Rage I know its a bit too late but I just think that the Spyro series are too fun Spyro  is better than the first but this game is still great The graphics and sound is nice the gameplay will leave you hours into this game and the story is original Spyro is one of my favorite series and this game is great and fun for everyoneI own all the Spyro games that Play Station has ever made I would have to say that this game has advanges and disadvanges Some good things about it is that this is the only Spyro game where you free the dragons In the rest of the games you help other people It is funny and very interesting  Sorry but I wont give the funny parts away 
The disadvanges is that you cant swim In the other to games you can but in this game if you touch the water you will die
Another bad thing is that they dont have the cute characters like the other two games I would buy Spyro  first and then buy Spyro  I think Spyro  has more stuff to do and has a better story line I even think Spyro has a better voice If you like all three Spyros try buying the Spyro pack It is much cheaper than buying all of the games seperatly Then you can decide which one is betterI had to return it because the green label lets you use the unlimited ammo cheatHonestly lets face it  RE was one of the best in the series and is always a serious must have  Were in the age of PSs now and I understand that since it is  that the graphics may not seem as good as they were when RE st came out but the gameplay is still awesome  Also the voiceacting is at least a step up from REThis game kept me dreaming as a child back in the late s I used to crave Resident evil  and its So realistic graphics Hey Back then Ps  Was Awesome Graphics Its Scary Its Frightening And its Impossible to beat with just a knife Give it a shot Only downside is poor Voice acting Like their captain obvious or something But if you Played RE  this will seem like a Downer game RE directors cut is where its atThe game is now available for download via PSN for only 

I spent  hours playing the game meaning I got my monies worthI see myself as a guru of Survival Horror games I likeem and I like what they make me feel Now lets get on with my review for Resident Evil 

I have to first mention that I did not and will not buy Resident Evil  or Resident Evil  for Gamecube unlike Resident Evil Remake they have nothing new to offer me or you which is sad after seeing what they did and what improvement remake was to the original Resident Evil So lets just keep this review centered around the Original Resident Evil  game for PSX 

Comparing RE  to RE or RE Directors Cut is like comparing Raw Horsemeat to a young Stallion Resident Evil  had better graphics and sound by far not to mention the fact that it was on a bigger bolder scale than Resident Evil Simple bottom line folks is that if your looking for a GOOD Survival Horror game pick this one up

I had no real gripes towards the game and I felt that the DEVs of the game did everything in the better interest for the Resident Evil genre As you can see by the score that I gave this game I liked it and I truly think youd like it aswellMy first experience with the Resident Evil series was with Code Veronica X  I was severely disappointed overall with it and from what Ive read the whole series is the same so I had little to no faith in it  I didnt feel the need whatsoever to play the other games and openly spoke out against the series even though I only played one game  But after playing Resident Evil  I got intrigued by the story so I decided to try out Resident Evil   I thought Theres no way they can be worse than Code Veronica so why not  And good god was I right

Although the first RE was little more than a big laughable joke thanks to the ridiculously horrible voice acting that makes what you find in Code Veronica X look like an Oscarwinning performance that wasnt really scary at all until the hunters came into the picture the second iteration really blew me away  Anybody who has known me for more than two seconds knows I dont care at all about graphics in a videogame so Im not going to say anything about them because it is irrelevant which is why Im not a GameCube or Xbox fan  The gameplay is very good for a survival horror  there is plenty of puzzle solving adventure exploration and combat to keep the interest level up  Thats what I like about survival horror its not just about fighting to stay alive but it is also about exploring and solving puzzles to unravel the plot and make sense out of mysterious circumstances  And while Resident Evil  isnt anywhere near as scary or intricate in story as the Silent Hill series it is still a topnotch game to play for any fan of the genre and I highly recommend it  The first one you can play on your own I just played it because I wanted to know what Wesker did to get Chris so ticked off with him and vice versa  The reason the title of my review is I was wrong is because I really was wrong in assuming that the Resident Evil series was a bunch of bunk and no worth anyones time  So I apologize for being a presumptuous jerk

But there is one issue I just cant stop from addressing the controversy over the control scheme  Now I wont go into one of my trademark rants insulting everybody but I will state my thoughts from an objective point of view  The reason survival horror games have such awkward controls is because the game developers wanted it that way  This is a genre for puzzle solving plotlines exploration and thought not just about shooting things  They made the controls this way to render it in a way a sort of antiaction type of game genre  Still though once you get used to the controls like me you will have no trouble blasting zombies torsos in two soon enough

Another thing that is cool about this game is the zombies and their creative death sequences okay so maybe they die a second time but this time for good  Naturally you can blow their heads off but even more possibilities await your execution  Sometimes you can fire at them and their arm will be severed by your bullets or with a shotgun you can shoot them at the base of their spine and they will be blasted in half the upper section of their body crawling on the ground with its arms alone to try and bite you  When you upgrade your shotgun later on you can actually blow their chest in half  And with a rocket launcher if you fire at them square in their torso their arms head and a good portion of their upper body will be gone  If you hit them to the right side most of said side will be gone as will their head and respective arm yet their left arm will still be attached  Pretty cool huh  Code Veronica X didnt have anything like that which is rather too bad

The only problem I had with this game and it really isnt a problem with the game itself is that it really made me shake my head at Code Veronica X  It almost seems as if Capcom had taken a huge step backward in their videogamemaking abilities  Heck even the first Resident Evil is better than RECVX  For example in the first one the hunters had narrow sharp reptilian eyes rows of razorsharp teeth that protruded from their mouths and they looked pretty scary but in Code Veronica they didnt have such teeth it almost looked like they didnt have any at all and they also had small beady eyes making them more of a joke than an intimidating enemy

Yet another good part about this game is the Titan  I must say he is really one heck of a bad guy  But of course hes nowhere near as badss as the Nemesis or as terrifying as Pyramid Head  But hes cool nonetheless

So in conclusion if you like survival horror games then I suggest you try this one out  But dont expect it to be better than Silent Hill if youre a fan of that series just as a side noteResident Evil   Circa

ADDITIONAL NOTES

 There is a remake of this game for the Nintendo  and Nintendo Game Cube both of which dont really upgrade anything

 The male playable character Leon is also the star of Resident Evil 

 Beating the game in a certain way can unlock two new characters Hunk and Tofu

 There was a rumor that you could unlock Akuma from Street Fighter Alpha as a playable character but that is not true

 In Japan Resident Evil  is called Biohazard Resident Evil  was one of the best Psx games back in the mid s as it had exclusive rights to Sony  The game was the sequal to one of the best Survival Horror game ever  Does this do better then its prediseccorYES  OH HELL YES  The game is a solid good game  The story line is really entertaining but it was more of a sci fi then a horror story  I wont spoil the story for you but the game is  discs and you control  charactersserpartly in the game  One is a cop named Leon Kennedy and the other is female after her missing brother Chriswho was in REand the two end up meeting eachother and the rest you can figure out

I really enjoyed this game it was fantastic  I loved the graphics for this game it was just wow  The game is pretty short if you play only one half of the character you play as  They both have  partskina  Once you complete that characters game it opens up the second of half of the other character  The game is fairly lenghy if you play the WHOLE game  The game has some great twists thatll keep you up all night  Lemmi make it easier for youResident Evil  was one of the coolest Playstation games ever  It had an awesome story line sweet graphics and decent dialoug  It is also spooky in the scare factor especially when you see something crawl around a window in the beggining of the game  In other words the game is awesome and scary

The graphics for that time were just great and comparable to Metal Gear Solid  The character model for Leon and Clair was amazing and the zombies looked even more creepy then before not to mention the bloody gore in this gamejeez  Capcom did a great job making the graphics  kudose

The gameplay is what really made me love this game  Gun n down zombies and solving puzzlemy type of game baby  The Puzzle are not that hard but they are pretty cool  The gameplay never gets boring and the boss fights are really cool  The gameplay may turn some off in the beggining  Mainly cause its just runing away from zombies but later on that will changetrust me

The sound is incredible  The zombies sound so realistic and the music for the boss fights are magnifecentmy spelling sucks I know  The sound it self deserves a one star

What turned me off was the kina cheezy sci fi story  It didnt have the same spooky feeling Resident Evil  had in storywhich causes me to take off one starWell yeah it was a stupid move just for that but hey thats my opinion

The games has amazing graphics great sound lots of awesome gameplay and is one of my favorite video game series  Not only that it may possibly be the best in the series if not then Its 

This game deserves a

 out 

Resident Evil series is a superb series and anyone who loves survival horror will love it  I personaly think its one of the best gaming series out but I dont have ALL the resident Evil games The only ones I have are the one that go with the story like the ones I have are

And for any newbie out there who is trying to get into the series if you have a gamecube and get the remake of the original and start with thatthen   then Resident Evil zero which is a really enjoyable Resident Evil gameWell

LatesI rented this game when it first game out I was scared out of my mind Everything made me jump now I have sort of gotten over that I am  and although the music and soundzombie moaning and feet stepping creates this scary atmosphere it is not THAT scary Most of you can handle it
Anyways I needed a strategy guide for some of it It just it just is unrealistic Yea to put out a fire you need a crank in a cabin Why was the crank removed in the first place We need to make it so if there is a fire of some sort this hose we have hooked up will release some water Yea they happened to put a handy dandy hose thingy in the ceiling so just incase a helicopter crashed under it or there was a mass fire under it the hose would put it out Yea right Ok you need a cord just to close some shutters so zombies wont attack you If the police were fighting they should of closed these shutters beforehand so less zombies came in Instead they decided to put the cord in an office about a mile away Wanna get into that room You need the crest and key and plugs buddy How did the police actually get around this police station
Moving off of that the game is alright You have alot of ammo on easy although I fear I will run out alot of the time I usually find a pack or  to keep me going The zombies themselves can take quite alot like  hits to kill them However once you get the pistol modification for Leon they become a whole lot easier The story is nice  people trying to escape a city full of undead living thingy creatures and such Theres alot of other characters though you arent the last  humans alive in the city The game even though was known to have a sequel considering tremendous profits finishes great It starts randomly but then ends where it should It succeeds in making a good game Good story some action you get to kill some of those evil zombies and good packageI will open with the Pros
Replayability  Its Hitman What did you expect You can go back and replay missions over and over to try for a cleaner quicker kill or just fly right through it in a weekend like I did
Length of game  Do not listen to reviews such as Xbox Official Magazine saying it is a lengthy game I finished it in one weekend Friday night Sat and Sunday I would estimate around  hours solid play BUTIf you go back and replay the missions for a better score then it can drag out much further But like I said to play through and complete the tasks it is not a long game
Story  Not bad at all A few plot holes made me scratch my head but not bad
Overall Graphics  Better than the old Hitman games but nothing at all like cut scenes Dont confuse cut scenes in the trailers as gameplay
Character dev  Although they give you a little info on specific targets it didnt seem worth the effort to look any deeper into their back story I just went forth on a killing spree You point me in that direction Here I go Theres no option to ever take a person into custody and question them You kill anyone who you are pointed at
Hand to hand  They kept it simple between space bar Q W or E were your controls to hit when it told you to hit that key It wasnt hard to do hand to hand It wasnt  awesome like Batman but it was pretty good
Cons
OMG why did all the people in closeup cut scenes talk with all their teeth showing It really got annoying I have never in my life met a person who talks like that Also the timing of the voice acting was bad Serious delays in dialogue had me thinking the conversation was over then it started up again So voice acting wasnt bad but developers did a poor job clipping it
Graphics  In regards to clipping I would sometimes get blocked by phantom walls while sneaking up steps I had to walk back and forth until it let me pass Also it would say there was a key point right in front of me blinking sonar circles and there was nothing there No desk nothing to pick up and it was floating in the air More developer issues
Minor Spoiler Dont read if you cant take hints
Sheer ease of killing other professional hitmen was a let down I couldnt believe how easy it was to kill hired professionals

Professional Edition Do not waste your money I got some weapons you cant even use in the game It gives you the loadout at the begining and the weapons around the map are all based off that part of the game No point in having access to the additional weapons
Sniper challenge is ONE challenge I beat it hands down and it never took me to a new challenge It just lets you do the same challenge over and over
All in all its a good game discounted at  price or lower Dont waste your  on the Pro EditionBeat the first yet If you have then jump right ahead to the second masterpiece in the series
Its fun its scary and it is one hell of a ride Ultimatley Resident Evil  will give some nightmares If the first one scared you get ready to be terrified againI played this before I played the original Resident Evil I had just barely gotten the Playstation and was renting a bunch of stuff Originally I hated this game because I couldnt figure out how to play it I had been a Nintendan with occasional defects to Sega I own a Genisis so I was unfamiliar with what has become a nearly standard control style for Playstation games I didnt understand the pivoting nor did I grasp the concept of holding R to aim and X to shoot I got frusterated and set it aside However my brother picked it up immediately after and managed to get me past the first screen Yes I got killed right away I watched my brother navigate his way through the game until he finally got killed by the first Licker He begged me to buy it So I did After a while I decided to give it another try and once I got used to the control style I beat it I have played this this Resident Evil and it many different incarnations across differnt platforms more than any other version I have also bought this one the most times trying to get the ultimate edition and eventually got tired of it and bought the Dual Shock Greatest Hits version after the N versions FMV sequences were so terrible Although I will not buy the forthcomming GameCube port unless they imporove it as drastically as they did the original I still recomend RE  as the most fun of the series If for some reason there is someone out there who does not already have some version of this game do yourself a favor and pick one up GameCube owners I recomend waiting for the GCN version as it is supposed to have all of the various enhancements that all of the various versions of this game had including the much desired analog control the N version featuredShipped quickly Had some issues with it reading at first but after a little cleaning it works greatI respect this game it is very good and takes me back to my childhood I just dont care for this type of game flying around shooting but for that type it is goodGreat n game played it when I was little kid one of the best n games ever made next to Mario  and  golden eyestarfox for n will always be a classic has fun game play only problem is that the game isnt overly challenging made to be winable by kids and isnt a very long game i remember winning it on several occasions in one sitting but still taking several hoursvery fun game thoughi just got this game today and it is fun and very intensealso this game is from  and its still really funThe title is a quote from the final boss Andross

A more accurate rating for this game overall is really  stars but of course Amazon wont let you grade in half stars  A true masterpiece Starfox  stands as one of the greatest games ever created for the Nintendo  and perhaps even all time  I recently got it as my first and only Star Fox title and though Im normally not a fan of games with shooting and space ships like this this game succeeded in impressing  Analyzing its features step by step its pretty hard to find reasons why this game shouldnt be loved

Storyline  The story is absolutely captivating  Though it starts out pretty simple and generic the galaxy and Corneria are being threatened by Venom someone save us etc the backstory behind it is pretty detailed the intro is epic and the story itself takes on a whole new life when you start playing  Actually YOU are the one who controls the story to a degree you can pretty much decide through skill andor choice whether things go great or awful for the Star Fox team a heroic pilot crew you can manipulate  You control Fox McCloud and only Fox McCloud but you also associate with the three pilots of Peppy Slippy and Falco why just protecting Falco and doing certain actions on the first level can decide which way the story goes  This game does a great job of drawing you into its world and making you want to figure out whats happening

Characters  I have to commend whoever came up with these interesting characters they make the game  Even on your own crew each one is distinctive Falco for example plays along the lines of the tough guy with a secretly caring heart  Peppy is like the fatherly instructive type and Slippy plays along the lines of a new school boy  Finally Fox the same character you control often takes on a reserved leadership role which makes sense  Each one has his own quirks and though any of them can be annoying on a certain level you cant help but feel a degree of liking for each of them  Their lines though perhaps epic for the time can be somewhat cheesy andor cliche Peppys Its Quiet    too quiet is a good example but the cheesiness adds to what is oddly a funny and lighthearted game  You often cant help but think I shouldnt be laughing at this but youll laugh anyway  Its just that kind of game  The AI of each character on maneuvering is decent but until you get skilled enough it can be hard not to shoot at them or let enemies get them as they get in your way at the oddest times then fuss at you when you do hit them  Peppy occasionally gives advice that doesnt particularly help either though it hardly ever hurts if you follow it  Speaking of advice though the game can make you depend on your characters if youre newer at it as they can each do something useful Peppy gives advice and often tells you where to shoot Slippy analyzes boss health meters and Falco often covers you  If someone gets shot down youll miss him  Finally the characters are also pretty lifelike in behavior try shooting down enemies that Falco is chasing on some levels and listen to his reaction to it

Graphics  Some issues with fog common for Nintendo  games but otherwise absolutely beautiful  The fog itself even can be justified as you spend most of your time in the air  Though many stages take either a purely generic spacial theme such as the asteroid field the planets are really intuitive  In this game you can find a volcanic environment which even mimics the wavy effects of heat an ocean environment full of fish and plant life a couple of cities a train depot    the works  The most interesting graphics you could see however has to be the part of the asteroid field you can warp to  Though it probably looks like youve taken a medication or something else you shouldnt have you cant deny the mysterious beauty of that point in the level    Please note however that what levels you see depends on what paths through the game you take like the story its dependent upon your actions in the levels

Mechanics  This covers things like controls ability to save and learning curve whether its easy or hard to master  The controls though they work well are pretty complicated to learn  This complication however is eased by the nice training mode they threw in a few rounds in training mode and youll pretty much have them down  The game can still be pretty tough to a degree though however I was able to nearly make it through the entire game on one of my first three rounds and Im usually not too hot at games like this before the Star Wolf team finished me off theyre pretty tough if you dont know how to handle them right  Make sure to master the somersault maneuver Ive never seen a game force you to rely on it as heavily as this one  In terms of saving I was disappointed theres no way to save and unlike what some people say theres no password feature either  Youll probably get sick of the first level for that reason  While its not a deal breaker this game isnt for the busy person whos looking to play for only an hour or less and quit  If you want to experience the true value of this game youd better set aside at least a couple of hours for it  The lack of a save feature is the biggest thing that kept me from giving this game a perfect score as I kept catching myself thinking This game would be perfect if only it had a save feature

Music and Sound  No complaints in the music and sound department  It pretty much captures the mood be it suspenseful hopeful dramatic or even rewarding  The character voices are also well done awesomely portraying the character personalities as well  I cant describe any of this justly though youll have to listen for yourself

Conclusion Star Fox  is a face of near perfection if only a few small blemishes hadnt reared their ugly heads  Multiplayer I hear is lacking but overall none of the minor flaws in this game are major dealbreakers  Personally I recommend this game to people who are bored and have a lot of time on their hands the replay value is great with its various paths  The final boss can be downright creepy and    well I think any critique could easily go on forever  Long story short this game is an absolute steal at the cheap price its at now  A fond memory in many gamers hearts this Star Fox  still remains as a highly recommended game to playIt can be said that this game is easy maybe the graphics is terrible but at the time i loved this game ive not touch this game in years however i can say i really enjoyed this all time classic
For the people who are true nitendo fans this is a classic that you can add to your  libary I still have my  and it works great so does the games Starfox is worth a try laterz folksAs with the first there is no save option but it is still fun to see how far you get in this game Its nice and challenging its just a drag there is no continue or save option here You can get extra lives though Like most games it gets easier the more you play it The graphics are superb and the music is very good too I just recommend you get the first Star Fox cause that game is longer You should still get this thoughAt first I thought this game stunk cause there was no save feature but there is a password feature and you can use other peoples passwords to start out on whatever level you feel Cheating has never looked so good There are great graphics and action and the gameplay is very straightforward All in all it deserves an A  A great gift to receive in SeptemberIn  Nintendo was on the cutting edge in the video gaming industry The Nintendo  proved that no mateer what a CDROM gaming system was able to do a cartridged based gaming system could do better That June the case really proved the theory with the release of Starfox  The game was the very first to incorporate Nintendos Rumple Pak a forcefeedback device that lets players feel each and every vibration at hand
In the game you play Fox McCloud a young determined fighter pilot who is sent on several missions to destroy Andross a inane mad genius that demands full control of the Lylat system There are  remarkable stages that let you encounter in the entire game alone over twentyfive different paths you decide on your way to Andross The graphics are so realistic and full of promise that you see the game so vividly you feel like youre a part of it In Starfox  you also have the use of  different vehicles depending on your course Arwing Landmaster Tank or the Blue Marine sub only used in the Aquas sea level The game also has a fierce battle level for up to  players where you shoot down your fellow squadron leaders Peppy Falco and Slippy
It took nearly two years for other companies to develop the feel of the game the exact same way Nintendo did with Starfox  The game is exactly one of a kind in the pilot seat While Nintendo stopped releasing the Rumble Pak with the game nearly six months later Starfox  is still truly a Nintendo gamers paradiseWhen i first played this game last Christmas for the first time i thought oh my goodness how do you play this this is a  mario game but at that time i wasnt feeling too well and the strange  appearance of the game made my head spin
As a result i played tomb  RaiderTLR insetad Happy to tell you that today id rather play this game  than Tomb Raider
Well its like a board game but much more fun Lots  of minigames lots of chances to shout and swear not that im telling you  to but its all goodnatured fun
The characters look kind of silly esp  Yoshi and Peach who look like circus rejectsbut i dont think the purpose  of playing a mario game or any decent video game is to see hunks and  babes
However this game falls short of Mario Kart replay glory cause  the formula can get tired at times
But if you want a solid firstparty  party game then this is it I havent played GoldenEye  or Perfect  Dark yet so as far as pure multiplayer mania is concerned this is number   next to Mario kart 
Yes its that goodUnlike some other reviewers I actually found that this game was enjoyable The only complaint I have is that the graphics looked like they belonged to a Super Nintendo Besides that the game is awesome
 The basic outline of the game is that you race the USA from California to Washington DC Each level gets harder as you pass along but not to worry Once you get the hang of the game you will beat the level after a few tries Each time you complete the whole entire racee California to DC you will earn a faster car
 So all in all Crus n USA is a pretty enjoyable game Buy and enjoy
HAPPY GAMINGGame came in horrible shape and did not work out the box I had to use alcohol to clean off the connectors to make it work Other than that it worked well But for the price I cant complain too muchOriginally bought this for myself to take a trip down memory lane but my  year old brother has been playing it nonstop for the past month lol It wasnt as great as I remember but at least someone is really enjoying it
The case itself was clean and works fine No problems at all The first of the Mario Party games

It really is an awesome game I only played it at a friends house as a child really so now many years later I finally decided to get it for myself along with  and  The n games are classic
I really only play it by myself but it is so much funner to play with friends You can get so angry when someone steals your star This is how you get in fights with your friends
The mini games are fun not as fun as  and  though
Never going to regret buying this game The first mario party while not the best mario partyholds a lot of nostalgia for me
if it werent for the stick spinning minigames id rank this in the top My son and I play this one together a lot I have yet to best him playing this game It was funIll be doing the Mario Party games next and besides this one and  I have the entire series  is the first one I played and still the one I hold very highly as one of the best ones in the series

The plot is very generic Toad wants to test everyone and see who can be the super star and thus the game that destroys friendships begin The original Mario Party is known for its difficulty in terms of mini games as the controllers back in the day were either unresponsive or some were just way too hard and required luck I might even add that some mini games like the tugowar required you to twirl your controller to the point that it might even break or hurt your hand Yeah some of the minigames are brutal On the plus side there are some memorable mini games where you had to work together to win the game and personally we didnt see that until Mario Party  with the boss battle

The game overall had the most nostalgic feel and introducing the characters personalities through the stages This game kind of set up Peachs obsession with cake and Luigi being the gadgeteer of the two brothers The music for the stage is very cute especially in Rainbow Castle I love how whoever gets th place gets the butt monkey treatment and attacked by the stage while st player achieves the mission needed

Overall a good start for the series but good luck finding this game This game never reached the virtual console because of the controls so its a rare find in any trade in store without it being at extremely high priceswell i received cruisn WORLD in the mail not cruisn USA but i prefer it so thats ok thats the only reason i gave  stars both are greatIve had this game basically since it launched in  I must say the graphics are rather impressive for an N game and the gameplay is great The minigames are fun especially when playing with other people The only real problem I had with this game is how it didnt last long at all It has about  mini games but you can easily beat the game and unlock them all within about a week of good playing timeThe days when people said Were having a Party A Mario Party  Seems to be long past  When this game first came out it seemed to be the only thing people talked about  Yet today with  Mario Parties in the collection this one still is wonderful for being the base roots
Just like any of the other Mario Parties you choose which character youd like to be Mario Luigi ect  The object of the game is to go around the board and collect Stars  Stars come at a price  coins  To get  coins you must win mini games or land on blue spots  This is like an advanced board game for the N but with a twist  In addition to the board game aspect of this game after everyone takes  turn a mini game takes place
Competitions in this mini game include
Everyone against eachother
 Vs 
 Vs 
This is where the intense fun comes on  You and your friends button smash spin the analog stick to your hearts content  As a matter of fact so much button smashing fast taps on the buttonstakes place that gloves came out for this game to protect your hand  Be warned if youre too competitive with this particular Mario Party you may wind up with a blistered palm or sore fingers
Its overall pure fun  Games can last for hours and hours if you really want  Though playing a board game on a console sounds dull this game completely opposite of that
If you want a great N gamethis is a must buy
If you are interested in this game but dont want to play an older console anymore or dont have a N I recommend Mario Party  and  for the Nintendo Gamecube  Exceptionally fun with  quite a bit less dangerous button smashingWhen Nintendo first made it onto the scene with Mario  they had no idea of how interesting it is to mold and shape the format of the Mario Brothers industry for the Nintendo  It became so big that every single thing had to be topped off to the next level of excitement and so on down the line
With Mario Party for Nintendo  they had absolutely no idea of how successful it has become The game features your choice of six characters to choose from Wario Mario Peach aka Princess Toadstool Yoshi Luigi and Donkey Kong The object of the game is to collect as many stars as possible by winning several different types of games including Tug O War where it is  player vs  players Bombs Away where you have to try stay on a floating island for  seconds without getting the shock from cannon shots coming and there is Deep Sea Divers where you have to collect as many treasure chests as possible without losing your breath There are also six different kinds of boards to play the game on as well as two very special hidden boards so look out
It is a shame that most games didnt seem to be like Mario Party Although many people are interested in the newer ones and the Gamecube version the original is always the best one to try for starters If you really want it then roll the dice and take that very first chanceIn Mario Party you take control of one of six Nintendo characters Mario Luigi Peach Yoshi Wario or Donkey Kong and move around a board as if you were playing a board game After each turn you play a minigame At the end of the minigame the winners get coins The coins can then be used to buy stars from Toad Sometimes you run into Bowser who does something random but never helps anyone The winner is the character with the most stars at the end of a set amount of turns A true original by Nintendo However there is a major problem with the controls
As you may have heard there are minigames in Mario Party that require rotating the control stick Doing this can lead to blisters on the palm of your hand In fact Nintendo realized this and was almost about to recall every copy of Mario Party But instead Nintendo released a statement to the public that they would send a glove to prevent blisters if you send them the cover of Mario Partys instruction manual
I realize that there are many people out there that do not want to go through the hassle of having to do more than buying the game in order to play the game Specifically the people who usually lose the instruction manual to their games the second after they open the box In this case how is the person going to be able to get the glove if they could not provide the object that Nintendo was looking for Nintendo should have found some other way to distribute the gloves A way that would allow anyone who has the game and cannot keep track of everything get there hands on or in a glove
Nintendo should have noticed this defect and corrected it before releasing Mario Party But dont let that stop you from buying it Its still a great game just dont forget to buy a gloveThis game is basically just you controlling Flik and steering away from bad bugs and collecting points and power ups to win I bought the game because I enjoy Toy Story on the Game Boy and figured PS action is just as fun Well I was mostly right Heres the pros and cons
Pros
 Good graphics
Good Character Model Animation
Lots of Power Ups
 Training Level
Cons
 Too many difficult enemies
 Levels dont get harder quickly
Anyway good gameThe graphics and audio in this game really leave more to be desired but the overall gameplay is loads of fun  Mission objectives and dificuly are good although you wont find yourself in a lot of fullblown shoot outs  Nevertheless it is a good game and I definitely would reccomend itRockstar games later went on to use the game engine and flight mechanics as well as the swimming and other parts of his game to improve what most of you would refer to as GTASA and GTA one could be labored to suggest that this game allowed and was the father of said games In the gaming industry it happens often that one game either spawns or helps improve the industry standards and this game thou over looked did more for the gaming world then most figure or see

This game is to GTA as Ultima Underworld is to Fallout  and that is to say they are the for runners that improved future games I suggest if your looking for good harmless violence without human on human violence I recommend this one if you still use your N I would point out that Human deaths that you allow or preform increase a ticking total and once you get to many you fail the level So the game even goes so far as to not allow it I will also add this game has one of the largest number of flying vehicles and ground vehicles and even boats and the likes of almost any game I have ever played in my entire lifeThis is my first review Ive done of a video game Body Harvest is a game thats very much fun to play Although I read through the instruction booklet this game SEEMS tough to figure out as to what to do next Its almost like having your own Johnny Quest cartoon to play Although you get just one life in your player sort of a futuristiclike space warrior you get plenty of chances to rejuice his power The graphics in MY opinion are good even though Ive heard others quoting that they didnt care for them Also enjoy the music that starts up whenever the aliens start coming in for the kill An hour can easily pass by when you play Body Harvest A good game to ownI have to admit as much as I want to praise this game it is mostly wasted potential  Even though this game came out in the later stage of the Ns run it has the graphics of a third party release title Read Theyre not all that great  Everything about the game reaches towards high concepts but almost nothing reaches its goal  The idea is that you are a timetraveling hero who has to save the world from various attacks from interstellar insects throughout history  While the story is pure fluff the gameplay at least in theory is not  DMA is well known for the Grand Theft Auto series of games and Body Harvest follows a similar formula  You shoot things then you get into various vehicles and shoot more things  The main difference is that in Body Harvest you dont want to run innocent people over
The controls are innovative and simple but not very well implimented  Its easy to get the hang of walking and driving the multitudes of carsboatsplanestanks but the controls are too lose for your character to move around with much precision  In addition the aiming system also fails to live up to its high concept  Basically you press the aim button which brings up a cool looking recticule but limits your movements  However since the enemies are so slow and predictable and the areas are so spacious battles boil down to mere shooting galleries  When the enemies get tougher faster and more numerous in the later levels it remains a shooting gallery just with the bugs doing the shooting  At this point in the game vehicles become not just the coolest part of the game and they are cool but totally necissary since you are toast without them even on the easy difficulty  Combat in vehicles even with aiming cababilities usually devolve into shooting whatever is right in front of you
Basically this is a high concept game that didnt quite make the grade and feels very rushed despite the fact that I waited a long time during its extended development  Furthermore with the next generation systems now on the market the graphics and framerate become simply unacceptable and this game might be better off when viewed as a curiousity piece or a very early beta of Grand Theft Auto If you want a well priced yet fulfilling few hours of destructive fun this is your game I found the ambience slightly disturbing thats good Fans of the films will appreciate all the locales being included The graphics are extremely dated but for fans of old school games who dont need extreme eye candy this is a solid buyFor those of us who got a PSX at rollout Alien Trilogy deffinately belongs in the list of all time PSX classic games  Sure by todays graphics standards its not so great but it has great game play  The best thing about this game is the ambiance  dark great music it is a little scarry  The game is simple to play and control  Yes the DoomUnreal crowd wont like it  not enough buttons and weapons of mass destruction  No this is the first person shooter your girlfriend will want to play too  Acclaim should remake this title for PS with more CG story cuts and cohesive plotOriginally released way way back a little after the release of the original Playstation Acclaims Alien Trilogy you can tell this game is old considering the film series stopped being a trilogy when the fourth film Alien Resurrection was released a year later on is a straight forward first person shooter in which you play as Ripley going through all the Xenomorph infested areas from the first three films  By todays standards the graphics gameplay and weapon options are all pretty dated but in its day Alien Trilogy was one of the better FPS games to hit the PS  All in all if you still have your PS and dig older FPS games you should give this one time gem a lookDecided to start collecting oldtime PS games and this one is a must have I remember playing this constantly throughout my childhoodMyst is a game of strategy You must use your mind to figure out the puzzles Sometimes they might be confusing or very tough But thats just the fun of this great game Graphics are very nice in Myst This game should be a must have for anyone who likes strategytype gamesDeep Cover Gecko is the third and last Gex game to be made This entry was made with the help of british developer EIDOS in exchange for Crystal Dynamics help in producing Soul Reaver and Tomb Raider Revelations but I digress
This game picks up after Gex Enter the Gecko with series baddie Rez kidnapping Gexs partner Agent Xtra Gex then heads back to the Media Dimension to save Extra and stop Rez once again
Gex  is the second D Gex game and is unique in a few ways Firstly none of the levels repeat In previous Gex games you would encounter multiple levels with the same theme For example youd complete a level based on horror films and then later in the game yould come across another one Each level in Gex  on the other hand is unique There is only one level per theme One Mystery channel one Anime channel etc
The Gameplay is largely the same as it was in Gex Enter the Gecko You control the camera with the shoulder buttons this time around but it can still be a major problem when judging distance while platofrming The other addition is a number of costumes that give you minor upgrades like a vampire cape to glide a superhero costume or a tunic to make you strong These are interesting and add some variety however theyre under utilized and dont show up very often This game also appeared on the N however there are fewer voice clips and no D cutscenes The other difference between the two is that the Mythology channel a parody of the old Hercules movies and Clash of the Titans has a different level design On the PS its set on Mt Olympus and on the N its set in Hades Now a game changer but a nifty fact
Dana Gould returns to voice Gex who is still amusing to listen to and Marliece Andrea plays Agent Xtra If youre playing a PAL version Gex is played by Danny JohnJules known for playing The Cat on BBCs Red Dwarf The unique levels have their own set of jokes which greatly reduces the chance of repetition which was a problem with the previous games

Its a shame that no new games have been made since but this was a pretty good conclusion Its a great PS game and a solid title for D platforming fans all aroundThe last time we saw Gex which was in the game called Gex Enter the gecko he saved tv from a robot named Rez Kinda wierd huh Well in this game a woman named Agent Xtra was captured by Rez When Gex was at home thinking about his last successes he decided to watch the news When he was in the middle of watching the news he saw that Agent Xtra was captured by Rez So Gex decided to go and save Agent Xtra So he goes to the Gex caves and starts his new adventure
What you gotta do is you have to go to new tv levels and collect as many tv remotes as you can Remember the more remotes you collect the closer you will get to Rez In this game Gex wears all sorts of different costumes like Hercugex Supergex Privategex Dracugex Little Red Riding Gex and Sherlockgex There is a whole lot more but I cannot name them all Gex also has rides too like Al Nino the donkey which can help Gex go up hills that are too slippery for Gex to climb and Humps the camel which can help Gex cross sinky sand and there are a few others There are secret characters that you can play in the bonus rounds but you have to find them first before you can play them There is Rex which is Gexs prehistoric ancestor and Cuz which is Gexs cousin
This game is really fun to play and not only that the graphics are very nice and colorful The colors in this game are much brighter than the other Gex games which makes this game even better and more fun to play but the camera is a bit slow but that is ok You will get used to it after a while The bad thing about this game is that there is adult language in it It says bad words like d and s While you are playing this game you will hear really really really funny oneliners from Gex but some of them have bad words in the oneliners or shall we say quotes Believe me do not let kids under the age of  to play this game That was the reason why I gave this game a four star instead of a five star But hey this game is okay for the whole family anyway if you have a child that is younger than the age of ten and you dont want your child to hear the bad words than you are lucky because there is a way to turn off the voice of Gex that way Gex wont even speak at all You can turn the Voice from Gex off by going to the pause menu
Well that is all I have to say about Gex Deep cover Gecko If you ever buy this game I hope you will like it as much as I did Thanks for taking your time to read my review       Following the popularity of Metal Gear Solid Syphon Filter is a game that stands up very well on its own  It has enough that is different that it can be considered a very good game in its own right  SF has a very nice  blend of shootemup and stealth missions that it is never the same thing  over and over  However it does find a few things lacking  The save  system is horrendous  You can only save at points that are very far apart  The checkpoint system which allows you to restart at the last checkpoint  helps this a little but being able to save a checkpoints would have made  this game much better  Also some scenarios are very difficult especially  if youve been playing it through and miss one detail  Most likely its a  detail that you will miss everytime which can make a few missions very  frustrating  The cut scenes are good and the game control is good  The  wide variety of weapons is very interesting as well  All in all this is a  very good game marred by a very few flawsWhen I was a kid my cousin would never let me play it because it was his newest game he had while I had to play with my sega genesis but once he sold it to me and I got it I felt in love with the game

The game it self is very straight forward and very fun But many things that come up now that I did not see as a kid are evident

The game is too easy The AIs have to lock on you to start doing damage were by the time they lock on you could easyly aim for their heads and kill them
The graphics looks like a bunch of blocks put together the character models which in my personal taste makes the game very hilarious
There are many glitches that you notice along the way but arent really game breaking
Even with all these problems the gameplay is amazing For a PSone game this is defenetly a very good gameSyphon Filter is a good rd person shooter with stealth elements  People have to remember that this was one of the early d games that tried to incorporate stealth elements so it is not as smooth as some of todays games but it is still pretty well done in my opinion The game has its flaws but was a very fun game and the difficulty was just right  Not too easy and the boss fights were pretty sweet and did require multiple attempts on my part  I have the disc version for the PS so I cannot comment on the digital versionThe game is excellent The plot is good I mean what can be better than a deadly poison killing people But the graphics could have been infinitly better The faces are flat and have hardly any detail and that is in the movie scenes The graphics are esspecially bad in gameplay The guns well let me just say it leaves more to be desired Blood is extremly fake looking but there is tons of it But the actual play itself is very fun
Now for the sound Music is okay Gun fire sounds are awesome But the one thing that could have been changed are the voice overs As soon as one is finished speaking the other one cuts in right away Not a very big deal but it wears on after awhile

Overall Syphon filter is a notch lower than Metal Gear solid  I meanafter a masterpiece like Metal Gear Solid there is no way you cant compare any espionage games to it The plot is shaky and its missing that smart dialouge  But its a fun shootemup game  So by all means get itIts a great substitute for the Nintendo I bought it for my brother he installed it and it works fineSeems to be working fine  Although not all the games we have are recognizing it as an available memory card  I have read in other reviews that if you copy saves over from a smaller capacity memory card those games will recognize it  I dont have a smaller capacity card with which to test thiswhy is it capcom never makes the hulk green he is always the wrong color on capcom games thegame is fun animation good just the hulks color is wrong  they either turn him pink or grey good tagteam work i like the turbo and wolverine looks like the comicbook style not some asian styled version of wolverine works well on the vibration sound is distorted but otherwise a fun gameIve been a big fan of the Street Fighter series since its outset And to be quite honest playing Marvel Super Heroes vs Street Fighter only reminds me of how great the series used to be Sure the game is mildly entertaining but without the true tag team gameplay that the arcade version of the game had it comes off as just another Street Fighter game with Marvel characters The character roster totals out at  with nine from the Street Fighter universe and eight from Marvel There are five modes of play including battle versus training hero battle and crossover Battle and versus are your typical one and twoplayer fighting game modes Hero Battle is an endurance mode that separates the groups to see which has the stronger stable of fighters Nothing special here Crossover mode however is at least somewhat interesting You see in the original version of MSH vs SF you could pick two fighters whom you could switch between at any time during the fight This tag team style of fighting was first featured in the arcade version of XMen vs Street Fighter but couldnt make it into the PlayStation port due to the technical limitations of the PlayStation Sadly the tag team aspect of MSH vs SF was also excluded for the same reason Sure you can still pick two characters but you can only play as one of them The second character only comes into play when you execute a team combo or team counter Crossover mode tries to bring the games main selling point home This mode allows you to pick two characters then the computer uses the same characters you picked This limits the amount of information the PlayStation has to handle to two characters instead of four If you are victorious in this battle the computer swaps one of the characters each of you have for another This is done so that you arent playing with and against the same two characters each fight It gives you the tag team experience of the arcade but having to deal with the rotating character thing and having to fight mirror images of yourself is extremely weak Visually MSH vs SF looks good But when you compare it with its arcade counterpart it simply fails The colors arent nearly as vibrant and the game suffers from quite a bit of slowdown It still comes across better than the PlayStation version of XMen vs Street Fighter though because not nearly as much animation was cut out This is a major plus since frames of animation not only affect the games appearance but timing and gameplay as well On the gameplay side Street Fighter fans will definitely feel the typical Street Fighter gameplay But in the end its all a question of how starved you are for another Street Fighter game Marvel Super Heroes vs Street Fighter is all about the tag team mode and with the overall exclusion of this mode Marvel Super Heroes vs Street Fighter is just another Street Fighter gameIf you dont have a Dreamcast and you love Capcoms Vs games Marvel Super Heroes Vs Street Fighter for Playstation is a decent alternative  There are some notable flaws as the Playstation hardware is just not made to run these type of games  For instance the biggest let down is the abscence of tagteaming the Playstation does not have enough RAM to store more than  characters within one loading session  Then theres the animationthere are definetly more than a few frames missing but once you get used to it its OK  However there a few gameplay extras Capcom included to keep players interested a helper character for each match a healing vitality gauge and a combo system that allows you to chain hyper combos together  Best of all though the gameplay stays relatively fast with minimal slowdown with the exception of extreme activity  This is another very noticeable improvement over the Playstation ports of Marvel Super Heroes and XMen Vs Street Fighter  If nothing else Capcom is to be commended for putting up with the Playstations limitations to squeeze out the best possible port of this gameDespite it being licensed it has a large element of fantasy to it hence adventure Youll be racing around volcanoes pyramids and in the Alps Is that a spaceship It might be This game holds up surprisingly well since the s and still offers a challenge and funFor Beetle Adventure Racing they decided to give a st time player only  tracks to play to start with Otherwise to get more tracks you have to to go to Championship Race and get the other tracks I look at these cheat things on the Internet and a lot of them dont mention that you can unlock tracks so I wanted to tell people that yes you can unlock tracks   racing tracks altogether  tracks plus there are these multiplayer tracks to unlock There are more multiplayer tracks but these are simpler They arent real racing tracks like the other  Think of them like battle games such as the ones on Mario Kart 

Now some people might say  racing tracks other than multiplayer thats it Cruisin USA  has  tracks However the  tracks are not normal tracks They are about twice as long as other racing games I have played such as Destruction Derby Cruisin USA Monster Truck Madness  etc You can play  laps of a course such as Coventry Coves and you are ending it in  minutes This is without stops or crashes The handling is good on this game so you probably wouldnt crash to begin with

Again the only thing I really dont like is that you to win the championship races to win so much They should have had  tracks they give you already   extra tracks you win with the championship races and more cars to win with the championship races It is what it is but its still a fun gameElectronic Arts was one of a small group of third party developers that supported the N with a decent amount of games One of them Beetle Adventure Racing was exclusive to the system and proved to be one of the best racing games to grace the Nintendo  Released in  it was an arcade racer with the physics seen in serious racers but poked fun at itself all throughout the game

In BAR you pick from a variety of Volkswagen Beetles and choose from one player modesingle and championship two player moderace only and beetle battle mode two to four players Select from one of six tracks first one only available from the start and youre off There are tons of stuff to unlock and the only way to get everything is by playing through the championship mode and beating the four difficulty levels As you pass each track it becomes available in the other game modes As you beat the game under each difficulty level you unlock additional versions of Beetles There are number boxes scattered throughout each track They count as points and need to be collected to earn continues and depending on the difficulty level you need a certain amount You can earn up to  points collect them all and you unlock a multiplayer track for the Beetle Battle mode only one track is available from the start Lastly there are flower boxes hidden throughout each track Finding them unlocks cheats that you can turn on and off under the options screen

The PROS There is so much content packed in this game you get your moneys worth instantly First off the graphics music sound effects controls and game play are impressive for a racing game on the N Then there is the satisfaction on unlocking the bonus content for you and your friends to enjoy later This game shows how to give players an incentive to play through the game entirely and have something to show for it Each track is huge and there are multiple surprises and shortcuts that each lap promises you a different experience each time The different versions of Beetles are pretty damn cool and its worth unlocking all of them The Beetle Battle mode is fun to play with your friends and is a game within itself the tracks are huge so getting  more players is the best way to go This game will take you awhile to beat since its quite challenging and that leads into

The CONSright here While BAR looks and sounds like an arcade racer it uses real car physics so part of the challenge comes to getting used to how it feels and controls The cars you start out with are slow and rigid while the ones you unlock later on control much better Also the AI cars start off slow and dont pose a challenge but as you play through each difficulty level they go faster bump into you and rarely make a mistake so dont be surprised if you have to try again to finish in st place This game is for those who want to put in time to unlock all the goodies here so if you want to pick up and play right away you wont have access to the entire game from the get go

Beetle Adventure Racing is a great racer that while can be quite difficult at times can be fun and is a good choice for those who like the San Francisco Rush and Cruisn games Its worth your money so those of you who like racing games and looking for a game to play with others grab yourself a copyRacing is my favorite genre and this is my favorite racing game The controls are grab and go with no fine points of control Something about them all being VW Bugs makes it appealing instead of boring Driving in the slush and snow here approaches the feel of real driving in snow ie planning turnsThere isnt anything wrong with the unit I received my complaint is it didnt come in the original box or anything despite getting it for a song I had assumed it wouldTHERE ARE SIX LONG TRACKS TO RACE ON IVE ONLY SEEN FOUR COVENTRY COVE MOUNT MAYHEM INFERNO ISLE  SUNSET SANDS THE TRACKS I HAVE YET TO PLAY ARE METRO MADNESS  WICKED WOODS MY FRIENDS AND I LOVE THIS RACING GAME IT IS WELL MADE NICE LOOKING  EASY TO CONTROL YOU MUST BEAT THE INDIVIDUAL TRACKS ON CHAMPIONSHIP MODE FOR THEM TO APPEAR ON SINGLE RACE  TWO PLAYER MODES I LOVE THE BOOST BOXES THE SHORT CUTS THE CAMERA OPTIONS  BEETLE BATTLE MODE IF YOUR LOOKING FOR A QUAILITY RACING GAME AT A NOW AFFORDABLE PRICE BEETLE ADVENTURE RACING FOR YOUR N IS AN EXCELLENT CHOICEdidnt work at first just had to warm it up its been working  days straightThis installment introduces some unusual elements to the series  mainly the instinct gauge which lets you look through walls and avoid raising suspicions but I sort of miss the older approach where keeping your distance and hiding your face did the trick Plus you have to refill said gauge by disabling or killing enemies to be able to use it once it runs out The visuals are vastly improved from Blood Money of course and I appreciate their allowing me to play with my gamepad

Some have criticized the fact that this game has too much story in it I may be biased even if I play an antihero I like him having some motivation to pursue a course of action but I didnt feel that the story took anything away from the gameplayThis thing is really great for those with a big PS collection The only issue I came across was that Kingdom Hearts games would not recognize them thus being unable to save It was unfortunate but I already had an official one from SONY to handle those rare exceptions Would certainly recommendWhen I first bought my N the expansion came with it I didnt know much about expansion packs until I searched online It basically improves the resolution and graphics in the games you play I know that it only works for some older games like mario kart  or super mario  Required games are donkey kong  and the legend of zelda majoras mask Its pretty good I guess accept I kinda wish it worked for all gamesFor all those people who complain that the Expansion Pak is not worth it because they cannot see the difference in graphics in certain games make sure you are making said comparison with games that ACTUALLY utilize the Expansion Pak

Just make sure that the seller sends you the OFFICIAL Nintendo Brand Pak and not some thirdparty knock off and youll be goldenIt works like the one for the N  Its a little bit bigger that youre not able to put the cover back on the N  I havent tried it yet with Perfect Dark and any other games that require the expansion pack  Its alright thoughwhen i bought my N i really suffered for games it seem like no one had N the gamesEVENTUALLY i was able to aquire game like Doom N  Duke Nuken ect with less than ordinary graphics in comparison to when i got my memory epansion Then came games like Donkey Kong   Perfect dark  Zelda Majaoras Mask well  let say that i really was impress to see the full potential of the N i always wondered why for the power that N had it was hard to see how Ps was so much more popular than N i know N had some really great games and the graphic was superior to Ps anyhow if you are a serious gamer the expansion pak is a must have and also you can experience the full potential of the N laterzzzz folks  gamersill start with the goods first of all its nice having this little gadget for ur N for games like The Legend of ZeldaMajoras Mask that requires u to have it and Perfect Dark where u practically need it to get the most out of the gameplay now the few bad things its a little difficult to get out the original jumperpak with the cheap plastic thingy they give you and for some of the games there arent much improvements with it they have pretty much the same graphics as the jumperpak but with like hydro thunder then u can have  players instead of  or  i forget which  it is cause i dont own the game i just saw the reviews off of nintendo magazinesi just bought an n but ive played one before with and without the expansion pak  though the pak does help with the graphics the n still cant touch the dreamcast or ps with regards to  graphics  still the pak does let you play perfect dark so it is a must haveSome of the coolest new games coming out are going to require this to play so you better get yourself one now It will be well worth it Itll soup up some older games that are made to work with it as wellAs a collector I absolutely love to pick up old retro games at the local Game XChange A few months ago I happened to come across a copy of Donkey Kong Land III for six dollars and made a point to snag it I didnt get around to playing it for a while but when I did it really helped me out some unexpected ways

Now Im sure youre wondering how playing a video game can quote unquote help you A few years ago I picked up a copy of the original Donkey Kong Country for the Super Nintendo at the same store but when I played through it something felt a bit off I just wasnt enjoying myself to the point I did when I played the game when I was younger I wasnt sure if the problem was me or if it was the game all I knew was I was going to have to play another game in the franchise as a point of reference to find out Fast forward a few years when I got around to this and well I had a blast After completing Donkey Kong Land III I played a few more games like Donkey Kong Country  on the GameBoy Advance and the original Donkey Kong Land and those only solidified the weird fact that I dont like the first SNES game for some reason Unfortunate and bizarre as that is Im glad the whole series hasnt shared its fate

Since Ive finished this game Ive played the other two Land games and while the original Land is good despite its problems  is oddly disappointing for some reason I feel this is the strongest of the GameBoy games and considering how little it costs to procure this is just an excellent game to add to anyones collection However as good as Donkey Kong Land III is  and how rewarding the unlockable time trial mode is  the sad fact is many people have completely forgotten about the Land series In a certain sense this isnt surprising given that ports of the original Super Nintendo games were made available on the GameBoy Advance but its shame that these games are being passed up

Regardless you can easily get about seven to eight hours of gameplay out of this one which is pretty impressive given todays second hand prices If youre looking to introduce a younger gamer into gaming and want to do it with a less expensive system like the GameBoy Advance this is a great way to goThis game is great  It is very challenging though  The graphics arent great but they work for this game  Die Hard Trilogy is better than the sequel because it is more fun to play through  It will take you a long while though  The game follows with the movies pretty good  All the modes on the game are fun but the driving mode is the hardest  You will definitely love this game Yippee Ki YayIf you think that the Star Wars Episode  Racer is an effort to cash in on the Phantom Menace hype you vastly underestimate the  talent at Lucasarts  As usual they top expectations and deliver something  far beyond a merchandising tiein  This is a product which pushes the  boundaries of the racing genre Take this featurerich game out of the Star  Wars Universe and you still have a thrilling easilynetworkable ride
The large number of different racers with different qualties is somewhat  pro forma nowadays in the genre but Lucasarts takes the idea one step  further  By winning purses you earn money with which to upgrade your  racer  Thus there are a number of useful configurations which are only  possible through victory
The number and quality of camera angles is  equally impressive  In fact the cockpit view is downright revolutionary  From this vantage point you feel the mph speeds and its  comparatively harder in this camera to complete tricky courses
Where the  game flags I suppose is in its surprising unfaithfulness to the film  Theres no ability to eliminate opposition by dirty tricks and  you cant disable the icrashedbutnowihaveanewracer  feature  The pod racers are absolutely indestructible here though they  can be seriously damaged and thats a disappointment  I wouldve liked a  harderedged versionperhaps one you could toggle on and  offbut its a small complaint for an otherwise stunning effortThis is a very good game in a way that when you has seen the film you just have to get as the play is just so like the film The game play is very like the film in many ways as if you split up the film in to sections then this game has a level in each piece of the film You can even follow the story while playing it So you dont have to have seen the film to appreciate this game but it will help as you will know what is happening throughout It is quite a hard game to get used to but once you do it becomes really good from there on and you cant get off of it as it is very addictive as you want to get to the next section of the film The good thing is that it is not only just an action game like you would think but also very much a strategy one having to figure out where to go next And to top it off you even play as queen amidala in one level If you love the film like i do then you will love thisThe Phantom Menace takes you on a journey through the great moments of the film It features very sharp looking graphics with a third person view a la Tomb Raider There are many puzzles within the actions scenes Each of the levels are pretty long and will take time for you to complete The hardest of which is when you first meet the mysterious little boy There isnt much to say bad about the game except that it could have benefited from being first person rather than rd Some of the camera angles are weird Other than that this is a very solid effortFor me this game is just about as fun as Sonic Adventure  It will keep you going for a pretty long time if you wanna beat the game with all  storylines And who doesnt The controls for the most part are pretty good Although there a times where you can accidentally be swinging a weapon and youll swing yourself right off a cliff and die That will happen more than once to you

My biggest problem with the game is the camera sometimes Especially when flying the camera will be in a position where you cant see the ground below you so youll have to guess as where to land And you WILL guess wrong at least once And you will die

Im not sure but I think the PS version is missing some textures Particularly when flying the shadow below the characters is missing The shadow is critical for knowing where you will land Without it it just makes things all the more difficult I think the shadow is present in the Gamecube version

But I love the level designs and the missions I dont find them overly difficult Theyre a challenge but thats a good thing

If youre a Sonic fan this is a must haveIts not exactly like previous Hitman games but it is still true enough to the series and fun in its own right to be a good game Not great but worth the sale price SCORE 

Graphics are like most Squeenix games are now amazing Tomb Raider Hitman Absolution Deus Ex Sleeping Dogs  they nail it HARD Played on ULTRA at p and its a beast It taxes the ASUS x even more than Tomb Raider but I dont think it looks any better so maybe not optimized as well Regardless stunning

It is a bit more closedin and linear but not linear in the way a platformer is or anything Still multiple ways to solve objectives

They have already said the next one will be true to form Update this already beautiful engine make it open world and bam perfect HitmanThis title marks Sonics first launch on more than one platformthree to be exact Finally a Sonic title is available on not only Game Cube but PlayStation  and XBox as well The Story Dr Eggman has devised a new plan to take over the world a newly reincarnated and upgrated Metal Sonic Thats right Sonics old rival from Sonic CD is back and ready for all new mayhem It will take more than one hero to foil Eggman this time Itll take twelve But when Metal Sonic gets enough power to change into the all mighty Metal Overlord will Sonic and his friends be enough to stop him Heroes features a uniqe team based gameplay which includes four teams of three including Team Sonic Sonic Tails and Knuckles Team Rose Amy Big and new comers Cream and Cheese Team Chaotix Vector Espio and Charmy and Team Dark Shadow Rouge and new comer E OMEGA To add to the fun each team has their own themed challenge ie Rose is easy Sonic is medium Dark is Hard and Chaotix is mission based Also each member has their own affiliation speed flight and power The game will tell you where you will need to use each characters uniqe skills Overall its a bit challenging for a Sonic title but its worth checking outSonic Heroes is a pretty good game The levels are super long and some of the bosses will get you pissed out of your mind  But after its all done the feeling of satisfaction is indescribable  Its really good to finally be playing as Knuckles and not have to go hunting The Chaotix are super cool too  And for the record HIS NAME IS ROBOTNIK Whats with calling him Eggman

Anyway BUY THIS GAME Youll be glad you didthis game requires the eye to play it you see yourself playing in the game thought any one who never saw the game but thought it was just another sega game should know it requires the eye to playI love the three person tag teams the trios run togeather but you can tag the next leader by pushing circle Every character on each team has their own special moves but the teams are all pretty well balanced they all have a fast hero a strong hero and a hero that can fly
The grapics are great fast and great It has a great third person view the camera is behind and above the team you can move to either side you can jump up you can fall down its just a great D game
Its soo easy and plays smoth my only complaint is it that it is too fast in some places like in the giant loops I easily lose track of the Sonic with him moveing from side to side he will run off a cliff and I wont notice it until he is deadIts a great game and really fun but also challenging at time The game basically follows the movie with some extras here and there The graphics are not the greatest but that is to be expected since its a Playstatin game But overall i would say its a fun game and replayableThanks again for this I have been a pokemon fanatic ever since I was a kid I couldnt ask for more thanks againAlways have loved pokemon series and the games This is definitely my favorite one Worked good but i bought collectible and it had the previous owners name in sharpie on it I didnt like that but it works greatThis is a great classic game  You begin as a new Pokemon trainer and soon select your first Pokemon  The choices are Charmander a fire typesquirtle a water typeor bulbasaur a fire type  Interestingly three Pokemon you choose from are like rockpaperscissors charmander beats bulbasaur squirtle beats charmander and bulbasaur beats squirtle  Soon you rival chooses his Pokemonannoyingly its always the one that has the type advantage like if you choose squirtle he will choose charmander  You are then given the task of completing a complete guide of Pokemon by catching all of them  In order to beat the game you only need the first  Pokemon however there is also a legendary number  Mew  You catch Pokemon by using one you already have to weaken it then catching it with a Pokeball  Once you catch a Pokemon you may use it to fight others but you can only have up to  Pokemon at a time  Along the way you will encounter other trainers you may battle  There are regular trainers which you battle only for money fun and experience  However there are also gym leaders which are specialized trainers with stronger Pokemon than regular trainers in their area have  There are  in all and once you beat them you may then battle the elite four who are much tougher than gym leaders and you have to fight all of them in succession  You also encounter your rival throughout the game  And he becomes Pokemon League Champion however once you defeat him you become Pokemon League Champion  There are also troublemaking team rocket members that you can and sometimes have to battle as well  Their boss is also the leader of gym   I have found the gym leaders and team rocket members are actually exceedingly easy if you know what youre doing however the elite  is very tough especially since you have to face them all toghether  There are also legendary Pokemon which are considered to be part of the  total and they are very rewarding but challenging to catch  Also one cool thing is there is a lot of movesalthough some are kind of stupid and certain Pokemon have strengths over others  For example fire takes out grass easily  However you can beat the game just by having stronger Pokemon however this is actually harder than using strategy  Because it takes a great length of time to level up while a skilled player can quickly catch a Pokemon with a type advantage  And to the guy who said he beat this game in a hourif you think this game is easy than you should quit playing videogames altoghether because you obviously are such a great master of everything  Also IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO BEAT THE GAME IN A HOUR  AT MINIMUM YOU HAVE TO PLAY IT FOR AT LEAST LIKE  HOURS FOR YOUR POKEMON TO BE HIGH ENOUGH LEVEL TOO  Oh wait you must have used a gameshark  Wow no wonder you are so good at videogames  But if anyone tells you they beat the game in a hour they either cheated found a big glitch or both  Or else their exaggerating  But the only way the game could really beat that easy is if you had a strategy guide  Oh this game is so easy I only had to read  books on it to beat it on the first try  GET REAL  IF THIS ISNT A CHALLENGE NOTHING IS  Overall its a great game but there are some annoying things  First off to get all  you must trade with freinds as neither red nor blue has every Pokemon but they do combined  Most Pokemon are in both versions but some are exclusive to either red or blue  Also as you level up your Pokemon they evolvewhich is really more accurately described as metamorphises and some only evolve by trading them with the same Pokemon with another player  Another thing is there is only one save slot Finally in the Japenese version by getting the first  you get number but in the US version you can only get them through Nintendos promotions or by cheating  Hmm giving Americans a raw deal aye Nintendo  You know we buy into your promotions instead of demanding that you make stuff available in the games  In Japan gamers would be outraged but you know you can take advantage of us Americans  Okay go ahead  But despite the fact that it isnt as good as the Japenese version or a perfect game Pokemon Red is still one of my favoritesLet us be honest with ourselves This is an old game And yet it rocks most hard say thankee Its also highly addictive

The point of Pokemon is simple catch cute little animated talking monsters with magic plastic balls and use them to kick the living daylights out of the cute talking monsters of your enemies So in truth its a lot like real life

Plus said monsters are fully changeable You can give them a name teach them special fighting skills and even control how much they grow This makes them much better than hamsters as pets go

Plus its got ninjas Im not only talking about a ninja master who uses Pokemon to duel you I guess he never learned how to use shuriken or swords or stuff I also mean you can name you Pokemon things like Mifune or Hayabusa or Zatoichi or Swordsman with an Umbrella that probably wont fit Of course you can also name it Winkydinkydo if it do please ya But I digress

Yes Pokemon shows its age among modern video games But so does Pong And Pong is still mildly amusing But without Pong thered be no Pokemom And without Pokemon thered be no modern video gamage And without video games Id have to actually face my family friends and problems and learn actual skills So play Pokemon Its better than Pong and many other video games Trust me Ive been thereI have no idea why I still play Pokemon from time to time  I was into it before it became popular and I still enjoy the games not the cards  more than  years after the fad breathed its last  Yes new titles have been coming out but no one seems to like them very much and they are not changing the game enough to make them worth buying
  Anyway about the game  You start out as a young boy living with your mother and set out to become the worlds greatest Pokemon trainer  When you try to leave town Professer Oak will give you a starter Pokemon the only real difference between this one and Yellow is that in Yellow you MUST start with Pikachu  Once you have picked one you must battle your rival and then you can leave  The rest is obvious
  The main reason I still like this game is that it has amazing Zeldaesque depth to it  Many puzzles and  element types of Pokemon  Certain types are stronger against others while each type has its weaknesses too There are a total of  Pokemon to be caught  However some only appear in the Red version and some only in Blue  You must link to the Blue version to catch all   To make this easier some people buy a Red AND Blue AND a Game Link Cable so they could complete the game on their own
  Overall this game is surprisingly fun and amusing and has a great depth to it which will please many RPG roleplaying game lovers  Great game so if you like RPGs or adventure games get this one if you dont already have itBy now every man woman andchild has heard of pokemon and its reputation  The cute little animals you catch in a ball and then force to fight eachother has captured the hearts of kids in America and the wallets of parents  Many people hate this game with out even giving it a try  Why is that the overly priced merchandice the barbaric card game banned in many elementary schools and pre schools nation wide and terrible TV show and average movies  When looking at all the stuff its easy to forget the concept and enjoyment of the game itself
The game is an RPG meaning experience building and random battles all in a quest in this case to become the best  You have a rival who you name and the two of you compete through out the entire game
because this is on Gameboy before Color the graphics are dull plain boring  However after getting past that you have a very deep very fun and very addicting game  Catching  of the creatures  through either gameshark or Pokemon Conventions and in these cases it is a little difficult to put the game down
Overall the game is worth playing because it is a lot of fun forget the stuff that it spawned and play the first game if you are an RPG Fan you will not be disapointedThis type of RPG was easy to master because at the start of the game I chose Bulbasaur for this type of match  I used him in the first  stages of the game but sometimes the rest of the game  Whenever you use a firetype attack on an icewater type it will either say Its super effective or Its not very effective  Otherwise this games a blast to play with  different pokemon characters to choose from  Go buy them both  Youll need them to link up to GoldSilverCame in manilla envelope without original box and papers who really needs that stuff anyways I bought it used for a reason
Game is  GOTYAY
Label was intact no sharpie on my copy eitherI am not much of a star wars fan but this game is fun I found it for  at a used game store It was worth it Its actually more fun when playing multiplayer and with the steering wheel I also enjoyed the star wars game shadow of the empireThis was a great buy for the N I was inspired to buy this game after seeing the movie scene with the Podracing So all an all you start off as a noob and work your way to the top buying parts for your pod You can choose from many racers I give this game the rating that it got for its fun with some frustrating racesThis is a very fun game possibly the best racing game I have played I normally find them very dull Nascar  anyone However as a racing game I enjoyed this immensely

Here is the flipside This game is not NEAR as good as say Hydro Thunder or Need for Speed The best thing about this game is the multiplayer as the single player gets old fast

My reccomendation find a friend rent the game and have funWell I love moving this fast in a vgame I enjoyed playing in the Tatooine course and the madeup levels actually seem like real STAR WARS designs unlike Rogue Squadron  Often youre racing through a level and you kind of want to stop playingbut you dont because you want to make the next turn or just love peacefully gliding over the land at that speed I never got into tuning up the racers maybe theres something lacking there You arent often right beside the other pod it would have been nice to implement an element of slamming into the other pod to have a fundangerous fight while performing the race if that option were here and was fun it would provide an allnew level of depthexcitement to the game maybe if you had to avoid Subulba like the film I thought I heard there will be a sequel to this game hopefully they will optimize it for the nextgen systems like Xbox because they didnt when this was merely ported to Sega Dreamcast A sequel would make a cool online game but make they could introduce AOTC areas or make a  more Tatooine levels The graphics here are very smudgey I would advise getting the PC or DC version or something but its worth getting as it is so inexpensive nowA really good game You get  characters to play as and  unlockables  stages and lots of items First player mode is fun and really hard to unlock nes Playable up to four players Free for all and team modes are available as well as time and stock modes Overall a great game that is fun for people of all ageswhile melee is by far my favorite brawl and the original come close one has nostalgic value while one is a good way to continue the series I love the game whether i am alone or with friendsone if the top  nintendo  games of all timejust as good as mario  to meit is one of the most popular tooThis game is good but SSBM is much better My favorite character here is Donky KongOkay there is only one bad thing about this game So now there is meele and  characters but there is only  in the other I am best with Captin Falcon I am worst at Pikachu Please Please Please do not laugh at my reiview I am only Super Smash Brothers is one of the most unique ideas to hit the gaming world since first person shooters featured deathmatch  For this game it features numerouse memorable nintendo characters such as Link MArio Pikachu Samus Arron Fox Mcloud and more in basically a battle royal  The real fun is wehn you gather a group of friends and go into battle  The action is almost always intense  However I do have a few complaints about the game
 Character Diversity  On the primary roster Three of the  basic characters come from one form or another of the mario universe Donkey Kong Yoshi MArio and then Luigi as a hidden characeter  So basically after all the hidden charactres are unlocked a royal pain in the  one thrid of the roster comes from the mario universe
 Story Mode Basically in story mode you go through variouse fights one on one an army of characters tag team handicap so on until you face the master hand and in the end it turns out your character is just a What you thought I was going to spoil the ending
So overall this game is great if you have a bunch of friends over however I would rather own the Gamecube version and that basically this is a rental for a weekend partyMy brother and I rented this game numerous times and in the end finally decided to buy it It is actually quite fun to play with many arenas and many of the famous characters from Nintendo Each character basically has their own arena and all of the arenas have their advantages and disadvantages This game is especially recommended as a gift for a child
What I love about this game is that you can play with as many computers as you want and they can be against you or if you want to have fun they can be on your team You can have timed battles or die from losing lives
Pros
 Fun multiplayer action
 Computer feature is greatyou can set computers skill level
 Good training level where you can control many things and add items and make the computer do things to help you train
 Just Great
Cons
 Certain characters are hard to get like Ness
 Less advanced than Super Smash Bros Melee
 Controls are sometimes difficult
This is a great gift for anyone who is young especially and for anyone with a Na great game for  or more players when i first played this game it was really fun an challenging after a while though it gets boring if you play it alot it gets too easy and its not as fun anymore if your going to play it you really need at least  playersWhat can I say Smash Bros is just an awesome game This is the only game you can get where all of your favorite Nintendo characters come together on one screen and battle it out I recommend calling over  more of your buddies and playing it because this game is nuts when  players go head to head
Overall I give Mario Smash Bros  stars I took off a star because after you obtain the  missing characters the game is basically over You can still battle with your friends but like most games it starts to get old after a while I recommend it for ages   SSB is an original fighter that is always fun to play It has four unlockable characters one unlockable arena and some other secerets The only bad part is it is a little to easyeven on very hard But this game is addicitive Short Version Graphics  Sound  Control  Fun Factor  Total The game is ok When I rented it for  days it got boring at the last day My brother got Jigglypuff using DK I would rent it before buying it  If you like it buy itThis game is the one my kids play more than any other on their Nintendo They have other games they rent other games but they keep coming back to this one
They like the two player option They like the challenge  theyre not teens yet They like the many characters that can be chosen  from different games They like being able to set their and the opponents  skill levels They just love this game
I personally wish it were a  little less violent but compared to other games out there this is a  teaparty So if youre a parent looking for a fun game that will give your  kids hundreds of hours of play and one they wont get tired of buy this  gamedo i really need to say anything else classic duke nukem game one of the first i played for the playstation great fps with decent graphics for its time and of course the classic duke nukem battle cries always make me laugh

good classic imoGood memory card it has a good saving memory I like it after I lost my other one I got this one buy it I recommened itToday i saw this game at the store for  bucks and im gonna pick it up since i have a PS I rented it  times after that the dumb stores got rid of their copies and it was better than the sega saturn version The graphics didnt have the neat lighting effects but the game was a whole lot more like the pc version If you have a PC get that version if you have a ps get this version or both Im probably one of the biggest Duke fans in my area i have the origional Duke D for PC the Atomic Edtion  The sega saturn versionmy st copy Duke Manhatten Project Time to Kill Land of the Babes the Duke Nukem album all of the Duke Nukem action figures The Duke Nukem screen saver pack and now this As the great Duke would say Holy ST Any way if you are one of the few who dont have a PS yet heres what will happen to this game You know how these losers say the game looks flat Lie You know how they say the N version looks better They fogot to tell you the game is cut up no nude chix and the textures are superlow res But with this vesion when you set up your PS for smooth texture mapping it will make all the D images get smooth edges and the textures will be nice and smooth Since the game is almost all spriteswhich isnt realy a bad thing at all easier to edit on pc Every image on screen will look close to a PS game The reason i dont give this  stars is because you cant edit it like the PC versionAlthough the Game Boy Advance is on the way the original Game Boy here in Colour form is still going strong and is still the only mainstream  handheld console
Compared with the sadlymissed Neo Geo Pocket the  screen is slightly less vibrant and sorely needs a backlight although  adding one would decimate the battery life Technically although the NGP  was bit there doesnt seem to be much difference and in any case its  the quality of the games thats important This is the Game Boys strength   it has an enormous evergrowing range of games some of which is  excellent the third Wario game for example or RType DX a faithful  recreation of RType on a tiny screen There are some more esoteric  applications too including a camera a sonar really productivity  software and a sequencer as used on Alec Empires We Punk  Einheit
As a possession its highly desirable  its small stylish  and easy to hold and apart from the fragile battery cover it seems very  solid Its slightly bulkier than the Game Boy Pocket but not  offputtingly so and keenlypriced too Only the high price of the  cartridges could put people off but with several million Game Boys out  there many of which are presumably restricted to playing Tetris and  nothing else there is a thriving secondhand marketI liked it unfortunately it is not very similar to the original Mario brothers but still enjoy playing itGraphics   Ridge Racer Type  is plausible in this area The car designs are fantastic and the roads are clear and wellcrafted
Sound   Fantastic Not too much of this comes from the cars themselves but the groovy soundtrack great commentator and crashing sounds give this baby a boost
Value   A fun car racing game that lasts a long time and challenges you to do better But in this genre we have seen games done better and you might want to go off and play them instead
Overall   What can I say I thought this was a blast It was fun energetic and speedy A good instalment to the Ridge Racer series The cars were brilliant and the Great Gran Prix is the best part However Ridge Racer Type  loses points because it is simply too much like Gran Turismo and you might tire of its sameold routine Still lots of fun and recommendedCame a little worse for the wear however it works but the screen is a little unclear and not bright enoughCondition wise color was faded and a bit dirty but screen works and same with the audio so I give it a For anyone who remembers the classic gameplay of the origional Super Mario Bros for your old  bit Nintendo Entertainment System back in the mid s  rejoice its back  The simple nature of this game makes it so wonderful  Its easy for players of all ages and skills to learn very quickly but will  take hours to master  Super Mario Bros is a true Video game origional  Its simply was the first well executed game of its kind  A side scrolling  adventure game with tasks to be completed that require skill and paitence  not just mindless button mashing
The Game Boy color version is no  different  It is a perfect translation of this timeless classic so give  it a whirl and fall in love all over againI want to play ps games and i needed a memory card and this fits the bill just fine It can hold many games so if you buy it you will be able to own more gamesReally great for an old school Game Boy Color It has very few scratches on the screen but the battery case is still there Despite the minor astetic wears it plays well and the volume works perfectly I would have given this five stars but the scratches were a minor problem that stopped me from doing soThis product is in perfect quality The screen is in perfect condition though not as bright as it seems in the product picture The atomic purple coloring is also not as vibrant but that is not the companies fault That is simply how Nintendo made them Im a pleasantly pleased with this product and will be purchasing from this selller againDoes what its supposed to do
Nice to have the extra memory Now I can store more game saves
Satisfied with purchaseI liked this thing It played in color but used up batteries fast The sound isnt all that great too quiet and the screen scratches easilythis isnt bad i have it and it works great i think this is better then alot of older systems like game boy or super nt but still its a good systemdiv idvideoblockRHCQTUOOGTM classasection aspacingsmall aspacingtopmini videoblockdivinput typehidden name valuehttpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesIEMoyZzlJHSmp classvideourlinput typehidden name valuehttpsimagesnasslimagesamazoncomimagesInlPpBmSpng classvideoslateimgurlnbspWatch video for demonstration on how the card works and shows how to the card reads on the PS

One of the most amazing things is when you can not only find new ways to bring your old consoles back to life but go even further and find ways to STILL find more uses Ever since the Playstation and beyond companies have put out tons of items that help give new life to an old thing

This memory card is no exception to that rule I have had this memory card for well over a year now and it has not failed me yet This is not to imply that it will last forever you should always make backups just in case Imagine now being able to save ALL your game saves on  memory card instead of having to look for spare room on an existing meg memory card Being able to hold x more than what a normal memory card can is pretty remarkable Although there have been a few odd moments that make this a bit of a well not so much a problem as its more of an annoyance

One example of annoyance you will have to deal with is that certain games will READ your card first before it will WRITE to the card to save This can take as much as  minutes before it will finally do anything and that can cause a problem if either you are not a patient person or you suddenly get a power spike to hit while in the middle of a save where it READS before it WRITES

Other than that the card works on just about every game I have played Numbering  games on my PS

Overall all I can say is I have not had that much of a problem with it and it has kept working for well over  year now Of course like any electronic device experiences will vary from person to person But for the price you cant beat itStreet Fighter Alpha   Circa

ADDITIONAL NOTES

 Last game in the Street Fighter Alpha franchise as of 

 Has all fighters from Street Fighters Alpha  and  as well as a few from the old time Street Fighters like Street Fighter II The world Tour

 Street Fighter Alpha is called Street Fighter Zero in Japan

 Practicality same game on Sega DreamcastStreet Fighter Alpha  is the best Street Fighter experience one can have on the original Playstation With well over  characters selectable from the outset classic Street Fighter gameplay and multiple gameplay modes this is one fighting game worthy of adding to any gamers library  There are a few faults though Some animation problems are present here and there some characters have newly animated moves that dont quite fit with their old set of animation frames the endings could have had more attention paid to them and some of the music is rather bland  Also for those of you who may not know the Alpha series is supposed to take place between the events of the original Street Fighter and Street Fighter   So why are we seeing characters appear that are from the later versions of Street Fighter  such as Deejay Fei Long T Hawk and Cammy  Even though Capcom may need to work on the story a bit its still nice to see all of the Street Fighters together in one game so Im not complaining Even though there have been countless versions of Street Fighter before it Street Fighter Alpha  proves that you cant beat a classic formula and that the series is still very enjoyable Unless youre completely burnt out on D fighting games I recommend picking up Street Fighter Alpha  for either Playstation or DreamcastI am confused by the claims that this joystick does not work with XP  XP is plugandplay just hook up the USB adapter and plug the thing in  It registers perfectly  Go to control panel and mess with the calibration and test all your buttons  that works perfectly as well  One drawback in not being able to use the W software is a lack of ability to reprogram the buttons  no biggie since most software will let you do the same but I dropped one star for that reason  XP users  dont concern yourself with the disk that comes with the joystick just plug the thing in and get on with the gamesAfter having tested several joysticks this is the one I kept coming back to  Ive had a version of this joystick on my system for two years and have yet to find anything better  I dont at all agree with the   editorial review that says its got stiff joystick movement  Quite to the  contrary its capable of very subtle movement
Plus its got lots of  features without being overengineered I especially like the fact that it  comes with both throttle and rudder control within easy reach  The button  cluster on the stick itself is very sensibly designed with all major  buttons a comfortable distance apart  The hat is cleverly devised as well  being both solid and flexible  Most importantly perhaps the software  now at least two years old is very stable and allows you complete control  over each button
Yet there are some people who might not find this  product enjoyable  As others have commented it is a very  righthandcentric design  Since there are a host of buttons on the  lefthand side of the base you cant hold the joystick in your left hand  and access those buttons without crossing your hands  Also the cluster of  buttons on the joystick itself are designed to fit the right hand  If  youre a righthanded person this design is ergonomically perfect  It  literally fits in the palm of your right hand  But a lefthanded person  has no business whatever buying this product
Neither does a Mac owner  This products USB connectivity though convenient to Windows users does  not extend to the Mac  Thats an unfortunate oversight that one suspects  wouldnt be all that difficult to correct
Still if you only intend to  use this thing on a Windows machine and if youre right handed youd be  hardpressed to find a better joystickI bought my controller from gtsboy for  It came in good shape You could tell it was used because the buttons moved easily and they werent stiff thats a good thing However the joystick had a problem The character would keep moving forward without the joystick being moved so I had to open it up and clean it a bit but other than that it was a great buyThin plastic kinda turned me off but the stick was fine not perfect but its how all my old controllers used to be Worn in and all buttons are responsiveGenuine N controller Tight joystick and quick delivery Product as described Cable is in good condition The product doesnt look as dark black as the controller in the image but Im not sure if that is because of wear or notIt works to my expectations I wish they Didnt demand a certain number of words since i dont have that much to sayA used original Nintendo brand N controllers is far superior than a new aftermarket brand controller Ive tried a few aftermarket brands and they end up falling apart literally are otherwise breaking while my used original Nintendo brand controllers still function The main weak point of any original Nintendo brand N controller is the stick This is almost always the part to fail so much that sellers know a firm stick is a selling point There is no question as to whether this will happen but how long until you have to fix it No worries when your stick gets loose buy a stick replacement Replacing the stick is far less troublesome then some of the issues Ive faced with the aftermarket brands Completely satisfied with this purchaseBought this and May Flash N Controller Adapter for PC USB for My Laptop and after i installed it and googled how to set it up to work with games on my computer in a couple of minutes i had my new N controller all set up and ready to play games on my PC and ive used it many times and still works as good as the day i got itI would say that Lunar is a worthy RPG and definitely still worth playing if you have an appreciation for the classics  However it may not be worth paying the exorbitant used prices the cheapest I found my copy was  then one of the discs was all scratched up and nonfunctioning and I had to buy new discs for   Yikes  Anyway lets see if Lunar withstands the test of time

Graphics score  Well since this version of Lunar the Playstation version was enhanced from the original it looks really good for an older RPG especially when compared to the playstation ports of Final Fantasy V and VI  However the graphics are still undeniably dated  On the bright side anime cutscenes are interspersed throughout the game Theres also an anime portrait whenever they speak which adds much needed detail to the characters so you can see what they really look like

Music score  Music is decent nothing that would make you buy the soundtrack or anything  There are a couple vocal tracks in the game which are also decent  Thankfully Lunas singing voice isnt too grating on the ears  I still dont understand though why everyone in the game keeps referring to her amazing singing voice when in my opinion she is only average  Well anyway there is limited voice acting in the game during scenes and also a couple battle phrases  The voice acting is pretty good the only voice Im glad we dont hear much of is Nalls which I imagine would get really annoying its highpitched and squeaky  You dont get to hear much voice acting anyway since its really only present during cutscenes

Characters score  Characters are likeable and amusing  They do have a decent amount of depth to their personalities so you really come to be attached to them  Because the story is so basic the likeable characters are really what keep this game afloat  Also some of the NPCs are downright hilarious

Story score   Lunar is certainly no Final Fantasy VII  The story itself is pretty basic  You start off as Alex who sets off on a quest to become a Dragonmaster person of status who helps keep things in order and peace  Then the story falls into the old pattern of finding X number of things in this case  dragons and saving the world from a powerhungry wouldbe ruler along the way  This is sort of the formula for every RPG in existence but at least other games add in unique and intriguing twists on this old formula to keep things interesting  Lunars storyline really has no extra twists or new concepts in it to keep things interesting thus it relies on excellent characterization  I really wish the game had explored certain concepts in more detail such as the why the Vile Tribe rejected Althena Ghaleons motivations and Althenas personality motivations and origin  However given the age of this game the lack of story depth is forgivable  After all almost all games made during this time period were pretty shallow storywise

Battle System score  Battles are a basic turnbased system  The usual attack defend magic item commands  As an interesting twist you can move around the battle screen thus making position a part of strategy  The only complaint I have with battles is that there is an AI command whereby you can have the battle automatically fought for you  I didnt really like this because the option is listed first in the menu which means youll spend some time accidentally hitting it  It wouldve been better if theyd put it at the bottom of the menu  Well this isnt really a big deal since the cursor in the game remembers where you last had it and always starts up there  So once you turn on the game and select command the next battle will have the cursor already on command  This was quite convenient

Gameplay score  This is a bit of a catchall category for me  One thing of note is that the menu system was a bit confusing at least for me  I really felt that it was needlessly complicated and I never quite got the hang going through it quickly  Its rather annoying having every party member have their own equip menu when you could just have one big equip option and then just select a character from there  I also hated having to physically put equipment in the persons hand before I could equip it  It wouldve been better to just let me select a person and then have every available piece of equipment in inventory for them pop up in a list  Shuffling items from Nalls inventory to each individual characters inventories is a pain especially if their inventory is full and you have to move items out first  Well anyway also of note is the leveling system  Bosses are always the same level as Alex is but regular enemies all have their own preset levels  This means that you must strike a delicate balance between underleveling and overleveling  I really liked this feature since it kept you from having to level grind all the time  Also enemies appear onscreenso there are no random battles which is awesome  Overall the gameplay is very smooth and enjoyable especially for an older game

Overall score  NOTE this score is not an average its my subjective overall score  Overall this was a decent enjoyable game  Even though the story isnt the best I really enjoyed the characters and they kept me playing  Is this game worth playing Yes  Is this game worth the eventual  I had to spend on it  Definitely not  I personally dont think this game is worth more than   If you can find it for less than that then go for it  If not then you might want to try the GBA remake Lunar Legend though I dont know how good it is since Ive never played it  If you dont happen to ever play this game then its no real loss since there are plenty of contemporary RPGs available that are much betterThis is an old fashioned RPG that may not appeal to those who have only known the likes of Final Fantasy X FFX and Xenosaga  Theres not a lot of cutscenes here to help tell the story  No fancy soundtrack  Very little voice acting which is a shame considering the voice actor for Ghaleon did a wonderful job Theres nothing like an elaborate prologue or ending that you got out of Xenosaga Instead gamers will have to depend on lots of reading and playing to make the story unfold
Battles are quite challenging  Basically you plan the moves for all of your characters and then turn control over to the battle system  There is also an option to have the battle system fight for you but this mode is not recommended
This games story is very mild and shallow compared to the other RPGs mentioned above  LSSSs strong points are definitely fighting and solving puzzles  The story is a lightweight  And definitely not for those looking for something along the lines of epicOriginally released back on the Sega Saturn Working Designs ports it over to the Playstation VERY NICELY The original great game is here with a few good enhancments The best one being the Anime scenes Very well done and they help move the story along nicely The games not up to par with the likes of most Final Fantasy games or many other SquareEnix RPGs but its definitely a must have for any RPG fan
Gameplay 
Ill start with the battle system The battles you run into to arent random you can see them on the screen and avoid some of them if you dont want to battle A lot of them are impossible to avoid though this is needed so you arent just running through the game not fighting You have the usual attack run and skills during the battles When you have your character do a physical attack he will move to the enemie hes attacking and stay in that spot while the enemies do their attacks Some of the enemy attacks will move your character a spot or two back This way theres some strategy involved on the placement of your character Each enemy has a certain amount of spots it can move so if you want to stay away from some of them dont attack an enemy thats surrounded by other enemies because they all will be in attacking range and they will all get a good attack in on you A lot of the times I didnt really worry about this but its a little added strategy to the battles other than the usual fighting One of the more useful ways of taking advantage of this though is to defend on one turn let the enemies move close to you and then hack and slash away This way you dont move in without getting an attack on your enemy and letting them attack you Be smart and you can avoid a hit here and there The battles are turn based by the way none of that meter stuff seen in most Final Fantasy games Really either way is good to me
The way skills are learned in this game is just your basic learn a skill at a certain level system Example Learn a small healing spell at level  Theres no custom way of learning your attacks You have to realize that this came out in the early s where there was only a game here and there had a deep system to go along with it It gets the job done but its not as advanced as some RPGers would like I didnt mind though Dont let this turn you away from the game You will miss out on a memorable experience if you do
The areas in this game are big good looking and fun to work your way through Your usual RPG stuff is here Caves Villages Castles etc They offer up a good challenge too which you cant say about a lot of RPGs out there Its not impossible by any means but its not easy either Good challenge The world you travel through is well designed and pretty big As a whole you wont find a bad or boring level in this game Its an expansive RPG world with many fun challenges along the way
The characters are very good They are pretty artistic A couple basic looking ones but overall they have my pick as some of the better ones in an RPG ever The character development is not too bad either Its not the best but you should soon care for each character atleast a little Especially the main ones like Alex and Luna
I like the story a lot You wont find a deep complex plot You get a straightfoward hero defeating the villian type of story Theres a good surprise here and there but not many You will grow to hate the villians and the story while not being too complex pulls you in and doesnt let you go until you finish the game I guarantee you will enjoy it
I take off the  because the battle system can get repetitive near the end of the game The boss battles have you basically using the same spell per character each turn hoping you have enough left to finish him off This makes the usual fun boss fights a little less fun than normal Atleast theyre challenging though since they always have the same level as your characters I didnt take off any more for the semibasic storyline and not so deep skill learning system because of the time it came out Thats something you have to realize when playing this game it was one of the best for its time
Replay Value 
As with a lot of RPGs its not very good I and many will play through again for the positives I mentioned above but theres really no incentive to come back and play through the  hour quest again Only for the hardcore RPGer I guess
Music 
Overall some very nice tunes scattered through out the game Its not mind blowing like some of the Square soundtracks but its a good one You will enjoy it for the most part I know I did
Graphics 
Im basing it on the year it came out The levelsand battle graphics look stunning With that said though the characters suffered and look pretty bland Thats the reason for the  point off Not a major problem at all though Especially when you play this one for the gameplay like all RPGs
OverallNot an average 
For its time it offered a fun battle system great graphics a good story and clever fun level design One of the best games in the genre at the time and rightfully so It has taken a slight hit over the years but overall it has stood the test of time pretty well RPG fans would be wise to not miss out on this With the special package one you get tons of extra goodies well worth the money although its only possible to find it on sites like Ebay If you find it go for it You will not be disappointed in the slightest at this classic RPG
I recommend Lunar  as well It improves upon this game in almost every wayOk Ill be honest here I read couple reviews and sensing that this game is bit overrated I sense people who wrote reviews frowning I did finish this game and trust me I had lot of expectation for this game I havent played the Sega CD version of it and actually blamed one of the reviewers from EGM who gave  when rest of them gave  or higher I thought this game deserves at least  I mean look at the animation the title animation is one of the most wellrepresented animated beginning ever and the music was just amazing  I was constantly humming the tune because it was so so SO GOOD couldnt help myself from humming it all the time Not only that Working Design did a fantasticexcellent job on putting in all the extra you are getting with this game its simply amazing Im left with no choice but to give credit for that  However after I finish the game I realized that I came to conclusion too soon when I did play only beginning portion of the game mesmerized with beautifully animated movie scene
I wasnt inspired or felt that heartache or anything like that
  I mean characters are adorable and the story is good enough to pull you in however it wasnt just strong enough
So when I read several reviews saying this is the best RPG for PS or anything like that I just couldnt agree with what they were saying of course everyone has right to their own opinion but in my humble opinion I just didnt feel it  It seemed to me that Im more attracted to the games with more stronger theme like Xenogear and Lunar falls into mildthemed game which is of course enjoyable
I didnt buy the sequel Eternal Blue which comes with more extra and whole box for the game looks great however I wasnt inspired enough to purchase Eternal Blue because it wasnt just there to hook me wasnt just there
Well its definitely your call so if the price is reasonable for you and plenty of time then give it a try and see how it goes Its nice to have this game if you are a collector however I wouldnt buy this game if you are picking this ONE RPG to enjoy in your busy life because there are better RPGs out there for PSOne in my humble opinionIf you are looking for story as the driving force behind an RPG then this is a game you will enjoy  Lunar doesnt rely on graphics or amazing sound  It relies on the strength of its storyline  The graphics are the type youd find on an older system which makes sense because this game was originally released on the SegaCD  This comes with two bonus CDs One is a soundtrack which is nothing to be excited about since the music isnt something youd want to listen to outside of the game but is a nice touch  The other is a making of CD that was rather interesting because you get to see how much the people who made this game were into it and cared about the finished product
One of the neat things about this game is all of the voice acting  Its such a nice touch and really adds a lot to the game  The female voices can seem rather whiny and too high pitched which could be said of the males at times too but other than that its quite good  Also there is a lot of pop culture references and innuendo going on that make you laugh  That may be the best thing about the game  The story is fun  The game is fun  You have fun playing the game
Its not new  Its not full of eye candy  But the game is very enjoyable and worth the money if you enjoy playing with a good storyThere are very few video games from over  years ago that still go strong in the second decade of the st century Myst is one of them I remember playing this game back in  and getting my but whipped with the puzzles I recently replayed it and found myself in awe of how well constructed it is Of course graphics have advanced since  but Myst shows game developers how puzzles should really work

Unlike too many games today Myst brilliantly evokes a sense of wonder and mystery When you start the game youre just thrown into a new world with no explanation You are left to explore and discover There is a story with shocking twists but the story depends upon your involvement and choices not simply handed to you

The puzzles require a lot of time and thought If you dont like puzzles and thinking dont play this game If you like challenges Myst will challenge you The puzzles often require you to make connections between separate pieces of information or view your environment in a new way Some are frustrating and I did need to look at a hint guide a few times particularly for the Mechanical Age elevator but they all do have a logic

Unlike other reviewers I found the one area Myst doesnt hold up well is in building an immersive environment Myst as a world doesnt have a logic Theres a spaceship a boat a clock tower etc just sitting on the island It seems more like a video game hub than an actual world I think Myst makes up for its lack of internal logic by leaving so much mysterious and presenting you with such intricate puzzles that you want to explore the world

Overall Myst was a historic computer game back in  and is still worth playing  years later From the early s I personally preferred Presto Studios Journeyman Project which also had a compelling pointandclick adventure and featured prerendered D environments However until that game gets rereleased Myst is easily the best pointandclick adventure readily out there

Note the game is also available on iPhone iPad Nintendo DS so theres no excuse not to try it outThe hit s game Myst set off the immensely popular Myst series as well as Myst spinoff computer games The game is fantasybased puzzle game incorporating unique locations and mechanical motifs While a bit outdated in some ways the game is intriguing and fun and well worth buying

Plot

You play a character who finds themselves stranded on a tiny island While exploring you begin to discover the dark past of the island which you are visiting Using ingenious linking books you can access other islands and unravel the truth behind the lonely mysterious worlds

Environment

The environments while not necessarily beautiful are well done There are a total of five islands all with different motifs These islands or ages include

A world with halfsunken boats and flooded tunnels

An age with a spinning building

A Cyprus forest with a network of treehouses

An odd outofthis world island with a gigantic tunnel

The environments can be rather dark at times In general there is little character interaction leaving the player dealing mostly with puzzles and exploring

Music drifts in and out of the game with some locations dominated by the sound of wind while others have music in the background The music alternates between very dark to dark tinged While the game does not have catchy tunes it suits the game quite well as background music

Characters

There are few characters and interaction is limited There is a selection of journals in a library which provide interesting reading and histories of the various islands

Puzzles

This game is a puzzle game The puzzles are generally mechanical in nature The puzzle solutions can be illusive but puzzles are generally not incredibly tedious Once you have solved puzzles once they can generally be solved again quickly allowing you to replay the game without worrying about coming to mounds of impossible puzzles yet again

If you enjoy puzzles that involve common sense more than mathematics and like interesting and unique worlds you will enjoy Myst The game has decent replay value The game is rather old and an updated edition called Real Myst is available on Amazon However for a genuine piece of gaming history the original is the way to goMyst is the one that started it all  Myst is the game by which all other roleplaying games are measured  No one had any idea when the game first came out in  that it would eventually become the bestselling computer game of all time
Rand and Robyn Miller the brothers who created the wildly successful game hit upon a winning idea  Place someone into an unknown world where the clues he or she uncovers reveals the story  And one of the biggest perks of all  you cant die
Myst starts off by dumping you on a dock overlooking a vast ocean  You can hear water lapping along the dock and a wind makes the hair on your neck stand up  And from there it only gets more interesting  you discover books that can link you to other worlds like this one more commonly called Ages you encounter all sorts of devices that even though they dont appear to do much are all part of the underlying thread tying the game together and just by wandering around you immerse yourself in the world that is Myst
Occasionally I meet people who are baffled at the success of Myst  They dont understand how a game where you just walk around and solve stuff can be so appealing  There is little or no character interaction they say  Ive noticed that a lot of these same people are those who like those shootem up and splatter their guts all over the wall type of gamers  The reason Myst has been so successful is because it so pure  you dont have to worry about dying you use your head to get your way through things and each new Age you encounter is just bursting with intriguing things to discover  That and each world is beautiful  Not as jawdropping as Riven and not nearly as mesmerizing as Myst III Exile but Myst has a subtle yet majestic beauty that makes it stand apart from other games
If you have never played a computer game before give Myst a try  You will be surprised at how addictive it can become  Did I mention that there is no possible way in which you can be killed  Seriously  How many games today offer that  Theres a reason why it has been such a hit millions and millions of people cant be wrongThis Game is a good game depending on your personality  If you like to drive around in a car in  New  York City or shooting up alien invadersin other words you like games with a lot of action then this is probably not the game for you  there is no action or enemies  Myst is more of exploring and puzzle solving  It requires quite a bit of patience to play  If your looking for an adventurepuzzle game then you should get myst in my opinion it is a great game  one of the best i have ever playedPlaying Shadowgate  was my first time playing any Shadowgate gameand I gotta say this sure was fun as hell

Its like a firstperson shooterbutnot Youre in first person mode and you go around searching for clues in the castle Doesnt sound like fun right Wrong The graphics are beautiful and the levels are nicely done and full of goodies Going around solving the games many puzzles isnt tedious in any wayits a joy and its a journey many should take the time to take

Sure the game has a few downsidesone being that your guy walks around like a lumbering beast Slow as hell And then the other is that there were a few times I died cheaplike thinking I would be able to swim jumping into the water and immediately drowning because obviously elves didnt get the poolside lessonslol Oh well though it was actually good for a laugh Just save your game often and get this game now

Overall  out of  a solid title to add to your N collectionI enjoyed this game where I was a character locked in a dungeon had to find my way out and then around castle Shadowgate to finally meet up with the main bad guy This is not a slash around killing game it is a puzzle and thinking game You walk around picking up things talking to people doing things a certain way to see what happens You can get killed in this game so be sure to save often your last save point is where you will start again if you are killed You need a memory card to save with this game I did get stuck in the game several times at least  times and had to write to Nintendo to find out how to proceed But with their help I made it to the very end This game is appropriate for children that can read as you must read to play the game and there is no goulish violenceI played it a while but it was alright The steam was a bit of trouble The more they move these game to steam the more of a hard time I have activating and playing a game But in spite of that it was fun I liked it Now I am looking forward to anno  I really want to play my way to the moonGiven the success of Myst a sequel was inevitable Riven is both a sequel in spirit and in its story The game takes place just after Myst and takes the player to another age where you meet Atrus father and wife amongst others As in Myst the story is told through journal entries puzzles and a few cinematic scenes Riven does develop the story more than Myst did with more cinematic cutscenes and longer books Overall I think this is a great addition and the actor who plays Ghen Atrus father is actually quite good

Like Myst Riven is a challenging puzzle game Overall the game isnt quite as challenging as Myst because the relationship between the puzzles and solutions arent as attenuated However there are a few cases where I felt like I knew what information I needed but didnt know where to find it This is particularly problematic in a pointandclick game with limited movement I was particularly frustrated with learning the Riven numbers  I knew I needed to in order to learn a code but couldnt figure out where to get the translation Also there is one thing in the very last puzzle which is a real pain  something impossible to see that needs to be moved

The graphics in Riven look beautiful even  years later The Riven environment is gorgeous and has some really startling landscape However the geography in Riven is supposedly  times larger than Mysts but because most of the game occurs within a single Age is actually does feel a bit smaller Moreover I felt like there were more corridors or areas that had no function other than to serve as space between two other areas Myst by contrast was extremely compact Im not sure which is better but Id guess that in terms of puzzle content the two games were about equal I would have preferred a bit more environment and fewer corridors

Ultimately Riven is a worthy sequel to Myst and follows its predecessor closely If you like Myst youll probably love Riven If not Riven probably doesnt offer anything new to change your mind RecommendedThis game actually stands up to the test of time as opposed to Myst part ones antiquated technology and ancient graphicsUnfortunately I never got to play these games when they came first came out and being spoiled with all the improvements in the visual department over the years had to start with Riven instead of Myst The game is probally the largest and most meticulous effort of all  games simply for being a little larger and a little more designed then many of the future underdeveloped but beautiful lands Myst would take us toObviously this game is for a certain type of quiet gamer who prefers exploration and figuring out how to work a puzzle out over visceral button mashing actionIf those attributes do intriuge you as a gamer however there is no better place and example to start with then the legendary Myst seriesRiven is a worthy followup to Myst and still must rate as one of the alltime great adventure games
Those familiar with the Myst series will know some of what to expect lush visuals although in static form no  rendering a detailed storyline fiendishly clever puzzles much mysterious machinery and a need to respond to and interact with the environment in order to solve the game
There are some important differences to the Myst series  First of all rather than exploring a number of different worlds or ages in Riven you explore one albeit large world comprised of five islands  There are links to two other ages but these are very sketchily developed and there is not much to explore here  There are some differences between the islands but the radically different tones of the ages in Myst or Myst III is missing
This has its advantages and disadvantages  The world you explore is much larger and you can progress over virtually the whole world without needing to solve many puzzles allowing even a casual player a good glimpse at the world of Riven
However it also means that the puzzles are less contained and linear than in the other Myst games  As well as a number of smaller puzzles there are two major puzzles to be solved clues for which are scattered throughout the islands  Even with the smaller puzzles the control to open a vital door might be located a long distance away or only accessible via a very circuitous route  This can add another degree of complexity to the puzzles  Having said that there is a degree of logic to most of the controls which are based on the culture and lifestyle of the inhabitants of Riven  The puzzles generally also operate in a logical manner and relate well to the entire environment of the game
There is little action for the punchemup enthusiasts  but theyre unlikely to be reading the review anyway
In summary a fantastic game that will engross you for hours  I just wish more alternative ages could have been includedThis game is great Its not as good as Myst but its still impressive This games backs right up to Myst so if you hannt played Myst you will have NO idea on whats going on Somthing thats better the Myst the grapics I dont know how good they are on PC because Ive got the playstation virsion but the graphics on that are awsome My opinion on buying it or renting it is you should buy it if youve played and BEATEN Myst But Bloskbuster donent carry this gameI havnt played Myst yet but I have completed this one What an immersive game this is Great graphics great sound great features to play with and great fantasy world Riven might only be a small world but its well worth the visit You even get to see some alien creatures here and there I give this  stars because the puzzles were a bit too hard for a lot of gamers It took me  months in all WITHOUT HINTS I might add If you like fantasy puzzles and exploration GET IT Its worth it just for the graphics aloneRiven is a worthy sequel to Myst and takes the Myst mystique to another level with five new worlds and an expanded story line  The brilliantly realized environments and moodsetting soundtrack draw you in  immediately and keep you there until the sun comes up  Riven is not for  gamers with short attention spanssimply navigating and charting the  accessible areas of the Age of Riven take patience and time and solving  what I would characterize as the two major puzzles requires all of the  intelligence and tenacity one can muster  As some reviewers have said  having played Myst first is helpful background to have but this is not  because the puzzles of Riven are similar to those of Myst but because Myst  will acquaint you with how the creators conceive puzzles and heighten your  sensitivity to factors in the environment that bear noting and  investigating  I gave Riven  stars rather than  for two reasons a  one of the major puzzles is soundbased and after some long and  frustrating efforts at solving it on my own I obtained some hints on the  internet and found that the solution required matching up particular sounds  from the game that in fact simply did not match up at least not in the  version that I bought and b one other crucial clue is a tiny blurry  image  In these respects I felt that the creators did not play fair  Two  other pointsi contrary to what some have said it is indeed possible to  lose this game and meet an untimely end so be careful out there and ii  recognize that the CDRom version is on  discs which need to be changed  every time you travel from one world to anotherif you have a DVDRom  player by all means spring for the DVD version which consists of one  discOnce again you put your hand to the book and enter another worldthis time Riven in an effort to find the wife of your host  Yes its still basically a slide show and yes there really arent any other people to  interact with but its still beautifully drawn with gorgeous environments  to explore and atmospheric music to soothe youApe Escape is on one of the sleekest action games on Playstation which is in theory a pretty lowpower console The graphics despite being  rather choppy are colorful and welltextured Most of all the game has a  high frame rate with no noticeable slowdown to speak of which allows  things to move quickly and smoothly The control scheme is intuitive  despite being complex at the outset Fortunately no action you can take  requires pressing more than one button Right shoulder buttons are jumping  left shoulder buttons center camera and bring you into a firstperson  lookaround mode digital dpad moves the camera left and right sticks move  the character and the selected tool respectively which the X triangle  circle and square buttons select your tool Also the controls are quite  tight which will save you much frustration from falling over cliffs and  such The camera is one of the best Ive ever seen It rarely swings around  the character although at times I did experience a few odd glitchy  perspectives such as from behind walls and from under floors Fortunately  the camera is springloaded to autocenter on the character
The level  selection is the usual cliche pretty meadowsvolcanoesrobotic factory  fare but in order to fulfill your quota of monkeys capturing  anachronistic and very agile monkeys is the point of the game you will  have to navigate your surroundings in all of the three dimensions and  utilize all of your equipment monkeys are caught with a net enemies are  disposed of with a force club you can glide with a hand copter  to reach higher ground or swim via help of a motorized sub which is part  of the appeal The levels are large and complex
The game is relatively  easy but the frantic excitement it creates will make you play it over and  over againUnfortunately the greatest hits edition freezes during a certain cutscene and is unplayable Fun and hilarious game overall just get the original versionIf youre trying to build up a classic PS collection make sure to include this wonderful lil platformer It may not be the quality of Crash Bandicoot but then again not many games live up to that seriesHow can you go wrong with obtaining a  Megabyte memory card for the PS Its exactly the same size there is no size fitting issue it looks and acts like a regular memory card and has fifteen times more space for saved games then the regular  Meg cards

The only problems I have encountered with this card is that some games it is not compatible with and the game will say there is no Memory Card in the PS or sometimes it doesnt read it at first so try again and it should Ive never had to try more than  or  times

The only games I have found it wouldnt work with was Stuntman Ignition possibly Stuntman too but I have not played it and I cant recall the other one but currently I own around  PS games and its been fine with all but  or  games But dont complain just use your existing  meg card or buy one from a pawn shop or somewhere for a dollar or two and use that for those games and the rest on this awesome card

Known games this doesnt work with that I have found
 Stuntman Ignition
 Guitar Hero games works fine with Rock Band tho
 Action Replay Max cheat device cant save data to itApe Escape consists of more than  D levels based on a variety of time zones To clear a level Spike played by you must capture a set number of monkeys After filling that quota you must access the next level Reaching the monkeys will require you to jump sneak swim climb and fly through a variety of situations  To help you on your way you are given a net and a lightsaber type stun club  Throughout the course of the game Spike will collect six additional gadgets  In addition to providing the means of completing future levels returning to previous levels with new gadgets will allow Spike to capture any monkeys he left behind In addition to monkeys each level has tokens to collect Collecting enough tokens will open minigames  This game gets addicting pretty fastI saw this game and it looked amusing so I got it I soon found out that it had unique gameplay and was unlike any game I had played in the past Its really fun and you get hooked on it Plus the unlockable mini games are a cool bonus The problem was the camera which could really be annoying at some times and the challenge Heres my tip If youre an advanced gamer  or older rent this game but do not buy Most  year olds and even some  year old have found this game easy But if youre younger than that youll go ape over this gameThis IS the funnest game I have ever played If your looking for a game with good graphics this isnt for you though But if your down with old school hardcore action then you need to buy thisDuke Nukem  isnt a bad game In fact it could be one of the best on N I dont know I havent played much shooters on N But I do own this and chaotic DM with  freinds and a bot couldnt get better Quake  and Doom  cant offer this much fun THis is essentially a port of the pc game but with new levels and addons to existing levels I recomend this gameThis is one of the best shoot em ups on the  This game is pretty much the same as the PC version but with more levels extended levels  or added bits and peices and a few new toys

It pretty much feels just like the PC version but its a little darker on the graphics You will have to run trough the game control settings to find the right feel for you if youre like me and where used to using the keyboard

Most of the cool stuff is still there from the PC game There is the same sayings some new ones same levels etc whats missing is the adult content the PC had packed into it So some things are different like there is no strippers dancing around and you cant go up and press OPEN to throw them money and the posters are different etc infact the second levels strip club has been completly re decorated into an outdoor loading dock with trucks Thats a bit of a disapointment that that stuff was replaced to tone it down

There is some new toys to play with but overall there isnt enough weaopens There is a hand gun shot gun machine gun plasma shooter grenade thrower shrinkin ray enlarging ray new weopen enlrage youre enemy till the explode and a few other ones But compared to something like Goldeneye there feels like harldy any guns to choose from

I used to love to use cheats on the PC version and with this  version there are a couple of cheats but theres none to walk through walls which I do miss

its pretty hard to stay alive so turn the god mode on and enjoy ityippie ka yay Duke established himself as a major rugged man in this title Classic shooting the same style as doom Filled with jet packs invisibility and loads of guns A shooter fan will appreciate the history and even the multiplayer versus bots that is sure to entertain for hoursThe game is cool but a lot of the levels are really dark A lot easier to play with cheats Im on level  and there are still more to go Its two players which is the only reason its good Otherwise zero hour is way betterI remember getting this game and being blown away The aliens the gore the raunchy bad  hero Duke NukemAWESOME

Ofcourse now we have Call of Duty Battlefield Dead Space etc But if you are wanting a vintage gem pick up this game  I stayed up countless nights with friends playing through the game in coop mode and facing off with each other in team death match  Solo player itself was quite challenging and still is  I have always felt this game sort of set the stage for FPS along with Perfect Dark and Golden Eye

Bad points  It can be irritating because it is so challenging  Also there are a lot of extremely dark areas of maps that make it hard to see maybe even impossible  At the time of its release I thought the graphics were great but now that I play through it again they are kind of disappointing  I mean still decent for the time but considering similar games that were on the they could have done a bit better

Good points Weapons are awesome  SMGs plasma canon that evaporates everything in its path pipe bombs shrink ray allowing you to crush your enemy expand ray that enlarges them until they explodeHA just coolness  Combat boosts were always a neat item that I wish had been in more games  You can also aquire a jetpack Vitamin X holoduke to confuse enemies dumdum explosive pistol rounds and many other helpful items

Fairly smart enemies and a wide variety of aliens  Challenging bosses as well

A lot of objectives on each map  Rescue the hidden babes find keycards solve lock puzzles even crush toilets and drink the water to regain health  And you get a good number of maps too

I would suggest picking this game up you get a lot of play time out of it  Its a good blast from the past for us who miss the N on occassionI got this game and I thought it was going to be just an okay game Did I ever find out how wrong I was The game is absolutely addictive You can play as the Global Defense Initiative GDIthe good guys or the bad guys who are simply called the NOD There are  GDI missions and  NOD missions There are also two exclusive N only missions for each side The grapihics are okay but not anything real fancy If you want to run the game in High Resolution mode make sure you have an expansion pack this also makes the graphics better Just remember to go to the opions menu and select High Resolution everytime you play because if you dont the game will run on Medium Resolution When you use and airstrick for the GDI or use a lot of flamthrowers flamtankes or a Nuclear Missile for the NOD the game play will so slow down to a crawl until the fire stopsm but after the napalm is it out the game goes back to its normal speed When a soldier dies he spills over and a little pile of blood comes out and then it disappears along with the body If you run over enemy troops with tank or something you get a squishy sound When a soldier dies you may hear a scream These are the only violent grapcis in the game The music is great at times but some of the tracks are boring This is the best strategy game for the N A little hint to help is that the NOD are great at whiping out infantry while the GDI are better equipped to handle tanks and defensive positions When you are capable to produce tanks and vehicles build vehicles instead of infratry because a NOD flame tank or a NOD flamethrower can wipe out a lot of infantry with no problem at all If you play as the NOD then build turrets and light tanks to take out the GDI forces You can use a group of light tanks to run over infantry Also another hint is that if you play as NOD build some recon motorcycles in the later missions when GDI uses ORCAs they are kind of like helicopters to harrass you and if the recon units are in guard mode they will attack the flying pests This is definitely a must have since new N games are no longer coming out Some of the later missions can take up to three to four hours to complete Have funI never got the chance to play this growing up I finally went out to buy it to see what all the hype was about and it took me back to memory lane I love the soundtrack and love the overall interactive design The interaction factor can keep you engaged The story was always weird to me and felt like patchwork but now that I am older and wiser I can make sense out of it now After playing through this recently I can saw that for its time it may have been seen as the greatest ever but I have a few grips I dont like about it Yet still it is good game I played Crisis Core first so next will be Dirge of Cerebus To any fan or newcomer to Final Fantasy such as myself I highly recommend this game but you will have to set aside alot of time to get the most out of itEDIT This is actually a Mb card according to my PS However apparently some games arent able to see that much space Persona  FES for example calls it an Mb card Otherwise it appears to be a good value for the money If your games do not have difficulty with the size then go for it End of edit  Jan 

If you think the price is good for an mb memory card then by all means go ahead Although the card and the packaging are both labeled as mb unless you are more fortunate than I you will find yourself with no more than mb when you insert it into the PS Funny that the guys at the local game store had never even heard of a mb card for PSAhhhhh  FF fond memories  The first RPG and first Final Fantasy game I ever played  Sweet mother of god you are ugly now
All things aside Final Fantasy  visually is probably one of the ugliest games in existence but the story characters combat and track keep it still relevant nowadays for a reason  If youre  into classics or are curious I shouldnt be the only person recommending you FFHavent beaten it yet but Im INCREDIBLY impressed with the graphics great music and fantastic artwork Gameplay takes some time to get use to thoughThe cutscenes were alright the gameplay was excellent and it really was a superb game for its time  I just had a hard time going back to the old graphicsI love Final fantasy games and they never fail to be fun This game was a lot of fun I wouldnt say I love it though because there are ways it could have been better It definitly was an awesome game especially for such an old oneI had never played this game until this year I wanted to see if this game lived up to its name

My previous experience with this series includes X XI and a touch of XIII I have to say that while I enjoy parts of X on the whole I hate these games  Most of this hatred stems from having more hours of cut scenes than hours of actual gameplay  I also like RPGs to have a roaming element I like being able to explore and I like finding sidequests and items  I did not get that with these titles  I expected FFVII to be the same and just riding its reputation

Bad news first  This is a PlayStation  game and oh my does it look it  This is an ugly game  Battles arent bad and cut scenes could be worse but walking around is bad  When exploring an area its often difficult to identify exits ramps and ladders and various switches  Theres a command that highlights ladders and exits to other areas but ramps and switches are still hidden  This option has saved me some headaches but its aesthetically displeasing  RPGs hadnt started the journal thing yet so skipping dialogue even accidentally or coming back to game after a busy week can lead to some confusion  The combat system because combat isnt intuitive and that there are a few too many status effects some of which can easily break the game with a bit of bad luck

Good news  The characters are varied and this together with the materia system allows for a wonderful amount of customization and different play styles  The characters themselves while definitely cliche have decent backstories and fairly strong characterization  Ive heard a lot of complaints about character angst in this game but I think those complaints are exaggerations and what angst is there matches the story and characters well  The plot itself is solid and has plenty of twists  The combat system works  I say its complicated and unintuitive but it functions well and allows experimentation with different tactics  Most importantly there isnt a single algorithm for success there are a variety of viable strategies for combat  Most sidequests are fun and while you dont need the sidequest rewards to beat the game those prizes are often quite powerful but not overpowered  This is nice as said sidequests neither feel like fluffpadding nor only masquerading as optional  The net result is that the game rewards exploration and experimentation  An additional nice touch is that grinding is on the whole unnecessary  The cut scenes are well done always convey something relevant and never overstay their welcome

Summary  The graphics are bad enough to be a turnoff but this is the only thing that doesnt hold up well  Its a long fun game with plenty of replay value  The combat is complex but it works well and that complexity allows the player to be creative and to try some very interesting things  This game certainly has its problems but its quality is undeniable and its rapidly becoming my favorite gameWhile this game may not be the very best RPG in my opinion I must give this game credit for being able to finally throw the RPG genre into the mainstream for two gaming generations This game was the first game in the series to feature stunning FMV with D character models in prerendered backgrounds which was a major step up for the RPG world considering that any RPG released before this one either only had D models during battle sequences or none at all but of course graphics are not everything Gameplay will always matter much more than the graphics in any game it is the sole reason games are played to enjoy the game itself with graphics just being an added bonus to the already great game itself

This game still maintains the fastpaced ATB system where the characters must react in a timely manner to defeat the enemies or bosses that will cross paths with the characters controlled in the battles One of the greatest highlights of this game is that this is the first game in the series to have a science fiction based plot otherwise unseen in earlier titles and very few other RPGs at the time
This game is also the first in the series to add character peripherals such as materia Materia can be equipped and can be made more powerful each time it is used

Overall I would highly recommend this title to advanced and beginners alike as this game has a straightforward level up system with a neat addition of the character peripheral I have mentioned above This should last one a good  hours depending on whether one decides to undertake the various sidequests offered in the game or notEveryone complains how great or how bad this game was To me when it first came out I loved it it was the first Final Fantasy game I played i was like  or  years old I still like the game a lot yes now it has bad graphics but they were cool back then The story was good but at times made you laugh Cloud was alright but there has been better but I thought sephiroth was a great bad guy and to me the best character in the game Yes it is long but I enjoy games that take time to beat and it wasnt very difficult to beat I enjoyed that there was a lot of extra stuff to do in the game besides the main storyline which is smoething games are missing these days

All in all I still enojy playing this game as most of the other Final Fantasys my favorite is  to be honest They all have good and bad things about them So its not my favorite game but its still one of themAll clouds giant sword jokes aside this game has one of the most loyal fanbase in gaming
Is it worthy of all the fanfare

Well i dont thing its worthy of rabid fanboyism and a  dollor price range but it is a damn good game

Dispensing with my usual the good the bad and the meh format lets do a rundown by detail

Graphics
It is a real mixed bag
The character models out of battle look ridiculous out of battle and pretty nice in battle
the backgrounds range to beautifully picturesque to lets see how much brown we can get away with The cutscenes are pretty epic

SPOILER ALERT

The high points to me were the opening the shinra building getting blown up and part of midgar callapsing onto a section of the slums

okay you can look now

The gameplay
No real suprises really aside from it including an active time battle system

Minigames
They are actually pretty neat and they give you lots of incentive to do them
maybe a little too much incentive actually seeing how one of them is the only place to get Omnislash My favorite being the chocobo farming and racing

The story
Well pretty good but i think FF VI and IV did it better tbh

Most of the game is traveling around the world chasing the big bad while avoiding or fighting the other big bad shrinra and unraveling the past
oh and theres this really weird scene in wallmarket

The music
Heres where the game REALLY shines giving us some of the most memorable tunes in video games
Just listen to One winged angel Now THAT is what death sounds like
albeit kinda a Jaws theme ripoff
Cosmo Canyons theme is amazing
The shinra theme stands out to me to

Music is subjective though so you may hate it

The characters
Cloud For most of the game hes a pretentious douchebag but he lightens up a bit near the end

Barret He is Mr T I guess someone at square really liked the Ateam

Tifa Sweet goodnatured girl who isnt afraid to fist fight godzilla kinda awesome
oh and she has a thing for cloud for some reason Speaking of that

Aerith The obligatory love interest

Red XIII Hes a lion that talks Hes the most level headed

Cid A washed up foul mouth old pilottechnician  my favorite

Vincent Hes a shapeshifting vampire and hes kinda sad about it
His past happens to be kinda messed uphes even sadder about that

Yuffie Was the lolita ninja a trope before this girl

Cait Sith I really dont remember many details about this thing beside that hes a robot controlled by Reeve  a shinra employee

Id go over the antogonist but i dont want this reviewretrospectic go be much longer

So if these characters sound cool to you then great

If you like this game then check out Legend of Dragoon by the way

If you are a collector with a lot of money to blow then get thisI found the only challenge to be the weapons and the final showdown with sephiroth This was a great game but way to easy to play because i played Phantasy Star prior to this On the other hand it had a slew of extra missions and hidden items and stuff to play for Find the ribbons and sephiroth will be a lot easier to fight I found two The graphics were terrible lets not lie ok and to add insult to injury there was never a remake In a way it makes me hate the game a bit more than i already do even though it was a game i spent most my time withIll admit the first time I ever played this game I wasnt that into it The main reason was that there in my opinion too many damn minigames that were kinda hard I STILL cant figure out how to get in line with the soldiers at the parade in I think Junon Also the music while very emotional is very very sad So is the story it got a little depressing to me

But that was the first time I played it Now Im playing it again this is my third time and I just beat the game about  months ago and Im finding the minigames arent quite as difficult Im not getting lost nearly as much and Ive gotta say the musics not quite so depressing anymore either Also I think it helps to play Crisis Core PSP prequel to the game or at least watch Advent Children movie whose plot takes place about  years after the events of the PS game The story is still quite sad but it works I think anyone who is into RPGs will definitely enjoy this oneThis is definetly one of the greatest games ever made but remember its gotten quite old now and for diehard RPG fans this game is not that greatI cant believe how many gamers are hailing this game as the best final fantasy ever i mean i know everyone has a different opinion and all but i mean come on hasnt any of you played final fantasy  that game pretty much did everything this game did only so much better where do i begin

characters cloudan emo whiny brat that annoyed me to know end i wish there was a shut up spell in this game to make him stop crying barrethow many black stereotypes can we fit into a single character lame

Tifehey she has a killer body not much personality but hey sex sells right Yuffiewhat was here purpose again aerishey someone with potential too bad she died before we could start to care cait sith although i shouldnt have to explain why this character is lame ill do it anywayshes a cat that rides on a stuffed animal robotpause for laughtera CAT that rides on a robotic stuffed animal then there is Vincent basically there for five minutes of an already convoluted story line that is other than that piece of the story he is in is an intirely optional character and can be put in the OF NO REAL IMPORTANCE folder oh and i almost forgot Cid yup his character was so awesome that i almost for got to mention him and then finaly Red  another character that had potential but when your surrounded by a bunch of numbskulls in a convoluted story line you stop caring about one character that has potential

then there is the main bad guy sepheroth many people say he is the best bad guy EVER Sepheroth is so BAD TO THE BONE man he rulz he was equally as much of a whiny emo brat like cloud he wanted to destroy the world cause he missed mommy and a whole lot of other silly plot twists to make the storyline seem more advanced and mature and i say this whoile heartedlyif you get defeated by a group of an emo whiner  a woman who has no real point in life other than to be said emos love object and to sell units do to sex appeal and  a CAT riding a robotic stuffed animal you are A not BAD TO THE BONE and B disqualified from the greatest villain of all time list sorry

story lineconvoluted a lot of unnessisary plot twists although it was servicable and interesting at points it would have helped to add characters withcharacter into the mix also there was several completely unncessary scenes in it where i thought totally didnt add a single thing to the game the cloud in the bath tub with the dude or the cross dressing game plus the ending reeked of dont know what to do wiht the story line so lets just say this happens

gameplay once again servicable but nothing revolutionary or even evolutionary as a matter of fact i think this game takes a step backwords instead of forwards  had the job system  had the unique leveling system  had not only unique skills per character but had awesome gameplay sequences such as the opera house the stategic scens where you control  parties to more and block advancing troops etc etc what did  do had cool summon animations that got old after the second view and could not be skippedpass

graphics they were horrible yes even for that time save for the stunning FMV sequences and the cool summon scenes that got old way too quick there was nothing pretty about this game dull grey and bland environments abound characters that made Lego characters look realistic and just an overall boring and grimmy disgusting lifelesslook to the whole project

sighwhere do you find best FF ever from this game Its not even close to the top  was it fun yes did it make RPGs popular in the states Yes although i prefer some of the other games that came out on the PS at the time such as wild arms suikodin and revelations persona more entertaining but the best not even close although i have to say it is better than Final Fantasy VII is a good game to play It is difficult at some points in the game I started  times just to overcome the beginning of the game and to progress to the continuation of the story The story line is good I especially like the stealing of items from monsters to see what all you can getsometimes a weapon or just healing items Sofar Im just at the stage where I left the city and roaming the world map Im trying to get more familiar with it It will take me a long time to finish this game since it has  discs maybe Ill never finish itLet me just break this game down step by step

Storyline

Very good and very easy to follow I like how it separates between Shinra and Sephiroth before the first disk is even half way over Very addicting and very fun to follow and it still always gets me going without ever getting old

Graphics

 years ago these graphics were considered best of all time

 years later we ask ourselves What the heck is this crap

One thing that never gets old is the fact that these poorly drawn D characters are unequally proportioned Huge hands twig arms No mouths or noses and yet they have huge hair In  all I can think of is to thank whoever came up with REAL D graphics

Characters

Each has their own special personality that I love Barrett being my favorite His attitude and swearing habits are possibly the funniest thing in the game I usually keep him in my party just for that reason Cloud is  stubborn but not as funny Tifas got that hair thing goinglike I just mentioned Aeris is kind of boring and dies too early in the game to get to know her a lot more than you do Red XIIhes a dog Cid another character who cant control his mouth Yuffiesome ninja girl that really serves no more meaning than a side quest Vincent amazing character who can morph into creatures And Cait Sithwait a minute hes a toy OO

Bosses

Each have their own difficulty which I like

Some require you to actually have trained or else face a brutal whipping Final  bosses each have their own twang to them Especially Sephiroth who is fun to go up against time and time again I mean cmon who doesnt like a cool character with a wing for an arm Music kind of gets to you though and his  minute Super Nova attack gets really frustrating when he does it about  times

I kind of wish there were more than  AllAmerican Creature bosses though

Magic

The whole materia thing is fun except for the fact that it ruins your stats

Limit Breaks

Easy to use hard to obtain

Playability

VeryHigh

Ive replayed this game time after time again without getting bored I try new strategies and new characters each time and try to level up differently than I did beforeI was in high school when this game came out I saw the commercials I was little confused about the title what happened to Final Fantasies  through  but the game looked cool I wanted it

I did not have a psx though However my best friend did A week after he bought it he invited me over and he showed me the game I was hooked by the time Cloud and Barrett rushed off the train

I had to have the game It was like no other Final Fantasy The characters and the environments were so vivid so REAL

I left my friends house with a burning desire to own this game and the knowledge of what had happened to Final Fantasies  through  or Final Fantasies   and 

After a few months of saving I had enough money and I bought the Playstation a memory card and Final Fantasy 

All in all the game kept me riveted until the very end The presentation was incredible The story was intriguing The game for me was an absolutely breathtaking experience

Really the only turnoffs for me were a handful of instances where the translation was confusing and some weird instances of homosexual innuendo honestly that was more comical than detracting

By todays standards the graphics are dated but I still play through this game from time to time and I thoroughly enjoy it every timeFinal Fantasy VII  Circa 

GOOD

 Considered a Classic PS RPG by many people

 Arguably Best story in a video game

 Epic story with fleshed out character

BAD

 Graphics are really dated D character models looked old even in 

 Game play may feel dated

IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE

 Turn based RPG

 No voiceovers so there is lots of reading

 Unless your looking for or like that retro lookfeel of an RPG it will feel dated to those raised on Final Fantasy X or Kingdom Hearts

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO

 Final Fantasy VIII

 Final Fantasy IX

 Legend of Dragoon

 Chrono Cross

ADDITIONAL NOTES

 There is two versions of this game in one version the female playable character is called Aeris and in another it is called Aerith note this is the same character

 There is a version for the PC as well

 The CG movie Final Fantasy Advent Children is a direct sequel to this game

 Note all Final Fantasy are not related to one another think of each Final Fantasy a its own game not connect in any realtrue way to another Final Fantasy the only exception is Final Fantasy X which is a sequel to Final Fantasy XThis game is OK but not near as good as FF FF has better graphics The characters look like dolls The cut scenes have good graphics If you want this game get it for a cheap price or get FF If your a big Final Fantasy buy it but if not I dont think you should get it I think you should buy FF insteadI had heard about the FF series but never paid too much attention to it mainly because I didnt have a PS fast foward to a couple of years and I was trying to get some games for my PS library I fell upon FFX let me just say I was blown away and I think the FF bug bit me hard I bought X and told everyone I got it for my sis Then talking with other FF Fantics they told me about VII I havent finished it yet that is why I gave it a  star review but it is awesome so far Love the scene where Cloud has the Motorcycle Despite the age of this game it really does stand the test of time and personally I agree with belledandy about doing a remake Id probably be the first person to buy it too For people considering buying this game believe me when I say it is worth every penny you spend on it If you are a fan of RPGs or of games on the whole its great I really dont care if people call it the best game ever or not all I know is that since I have started playing it I cant put it down and my family and friends do feel neglectedIm old enough to remember when RPGs werent called RPGs In those days the essence of the game was to move the players about a game board fighting battles collecting treasure and finding clues Origins Ultima series was the grandparent of these games  immensely entertaining but essentially twodimensional Among its heirs were the first games in the Final Fantasy line

This was also a time when computer capabilities and capacity seemed to double every few months Final Fantasy VII is the result of an inevitable synergy between technology and imagination Players found themselves in a threedimensional world where they could wander at will They were playing with characters that were not only more animated and lifelike but also had something that resembled personalities In a very real sense FFVII changed the gaming landscape and RPGs reached a new level of credibility

What is inside is the story of Cloud Strife an exsoldier turned mercenary who is drawn into the struggle between Avalanche a revolutionary group and Shinra a rapacious company that is rapidly draining the resources of the planet Starting out in the city Midgar the battle moves back and forth across the planet as Cloud gathers team members accessories and power Everyone has a history often mysterious and an important role to play

Eventually it becomes clear that the real enemy is a laboratory experiment gone horribly wrong Shinras effort to produce supermen has created Sephiroth who has become one of the legendary villains of the gaming world Physically beautiful his mind has been ruined by his knowledge of what he is and his goal has become the destruction of the world

The plot is remarkably rich Within the main story arc are many smaller stories that build the players understanding of the nature of each of the characters There seem to be an unending number of weapons powers and monsters More than enough material for many replays The graphics are a bit primitive for our time but were startling when this game first came out As your imagination adapts to the imagery the game becomes truly engaging on many levels Final Fantasy VII is still one of the best of its genre Whether you are a student of gaming or an aficionado it belongs on your shelfI have just recently finished playing FFVII for the first time  Before playing it I read a lot of comments from people claiming that this game is the best ever  While I do believe it to be good I cant fully agree  I enjoyed FFVIII more despite the fact that that opinion will likely discredit anything else I say in the eyes of all the rampant FF haters out there I must admit  But vastly this was a great game

The graphics werent wonderful but what can you expect from the earliest of the D Square games  I had played  and  before this so the graphics were admittedly a bit of a letdown but the story was more than enough to make up for it  I just found it quite funny how everyones hands looked like large boxes  

The music was good and the character development was about as good as you can expect in a video game with more than four main characters  Even in the best of games some characters are left undeveloped and it is no difference here  Cloud Tifa and Barret get a good deal of character development though other main characters are left less known

There were a great deal of side quests and minigames which I enjoyed immensely  Snowboarding was my personal favorite    You can spend hours completeing the sidequests alone and most people end up detouring from the plot for vast amounts of time at the Gold Saucer

The plot tended to be confusing at times at least for the first time through  However it was intriguing and Sephrioth is a refreshingly evil bad guy  The final battle against him was pathetically easy I killed him twice in a row without dying once at level  or so but up until the point you actually fight him in his final form hes a truely malevolent villain

I would recommend this game for any Final Fantasy fan or any fan of RPGs in general  Its well worth the money and time  Just because I said I didnt believe the theory that this is the greatest game ever invented does not in any way mean that I dislike it  Its and excellent and entertaining game and by no means should be passed upWhen I played this it was magic Journey back to the midlife of the PlayStation No not the PlayStation  the original PlayStation Yes to the kids who were born just before the release of the PlayStation  and are now reviewing FFVII against games on the PS and Xbox there really was a previous version of the PS It was a greyish top loading CD based yes CD system with no USB or iLink FireWire for the PC crowd After the end of Final Fantasy games on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System by Nintendo yes there really was a system called SNES that came before the Game Cube and for you old foagies among us the N Nintendo  Final Fantasy finally got the D treatment for the first time Or at least the characters did The backgrounds were prerendered textures That is the backgrounds werent true D they were rendered on a computer in D and then a snapshot of them at a certain angle was taken and slapped behind characters who were complete D rendered internally by the original PlayStation remember the system that came from Sony before the PS Only because the PlayStation couldnt render fully D extremely detailed environments by itself Up until FFVII which by the way was not the first Final Fantasy to be developed there were other D twodimensional offerings that only people who are long dead or are old and senile will remember ask your great great great grandfather if he remembers playing Final Fantasy on his Nintindo EnturTainMant Sihstim back in the trenches during WWII there was a real worry that Squaresoft as SquareEnix was called back then really had abandoned Final Fantasy games in favor of simple graphic demos on completely unknown systems like the N Not so Those demos were actually distractions from the truth That SquareEnix errr I mean Squaresoft was readying its Final Fantasy XII demo called Final Fantasy VII on the equally unknown PlayStation or as some Amish like to call it the PSX But at that time the network feature wasnt fully implemented which made for a lonely playing experience for some already lonely and pathetic supernerds out there But for us old timers it was a blast seeing Final Fantasy in D finally However we didnt get the demo but unfortunately we got the fully playable game Which was great in and of itself Because it showed what was possible with the Final Fantasy franchise which wouldnt be fully realized until late  when all gamers finally proclaim in one voice What Another Final Fantasy game I thought they discontinued it back when Roman caesars ruled the known realityuniverse and mammoths roamed computer generated alien landscapes Oh well anything before Doom  is going to vanish from the collective memory of computergamedom anyway so dont play this because you wont be able to Its just too alien an experience for todays DDR generation oh for those fetuses unfamiliar with DDR its Dance Dance Revolution and its what todays elderly play when their hips arent healing fast enough
BTW stop being putzes and review the game fairly and in its own context of time It looks really dumb when someone starts comparing it to something so far advanced its not even fair Perspective my children Get someMy favorite character is Sephiroth He also makes an appearance in kingdom Hearts as the toughest boss in the gamebut i beat him
Final Fantasy VII is a brillant mindblowing game
Cloud is the main character of this game He also makes an appearance in Kingdom Hearts as  or  bosseshes easy
The thing isI couldnt even get past the mechanical scorpion
The game is just way too hard for me But I beat it
The Sephiroths are also Hard
If youre in for some actionbuy this
Cloud is just such an amzig characterand so is Sephiroth
sincerly
  kennyAlthough the graphics arent as good as one would expect the characters are very well done  Espeically Sephiroth he seems to be the very essence of evil with the tricks he pulls of in the game  Many of the mini games are great my only beef with the mini games is that they should of amde the minibattle game available in the Golden Saucer also why didnt they put in real voices in the end instead of a postscript  This was probably to save money so Square wouldnt have to hire voice actors Although the plot veers off track at times and a few of the program quirks are noticable this games still enjoyable and has a well written storyI must say this game is great I have written another review for this game but i didnt feel it was completey correct One thing was it is confusing and I cant say its for everyone i say this because if you dont like FF and you havent tried FF before dont start here The game is funbut not good graphics and its confusing Yu may not like this gameI warn youThe story and plot are interesting enough to keep a gamer entertained  Gameplay is entertaining but also challenging
I cannot give the game five stars though  I had already played the likes of FFX and Xenosaga prior to playing this game  Their superior visuals and certainly the inclusion of voiceacting made the experience more enjoyable than FF  In other words I would have enjoyed FF if I had experienced the game prior to playing more recent RPGsFF was my first game to play from FF Great graphics very mundane story and the mini games were very well worth it This game should be added towards your FF collectionFinal Fantasy  is one of those games that deals with a variety of aspects instead of just focusing on one It may seem to have just your simple everyday theme of an average game Once you get to actually playing the game and beating it you will understand what the whole concept of this game is about It is more than just a battle of good and evil it deals with what certain characters are going through at a time of crisis
Story
  The story in FF was very well done fit very nicely with the characters and surroundings At first playing FF I didnt really think much of the story until they started to developing the characters and other minor aspects in to place Once the game progressed I could tell that I was starting to become entwined with this game not only physically but emotionally as well One thing on the story I feel that they could have portrayed better would have been how it all started they never really went into much depth of how it all started

Appearance
  At first glance at FF it doesnt really look like much Basically looks like your average game where you fight the bad guy save the girl and so on The appearance of the game also relies on the story You have to understand what is going on to get the whole meaning out of a certain scene FF is one of those games that illustrates this property very well At the time of the games release which you can see here it had some of the best graphics for any PSX game

Characters
  The characters of FF were portrayed beautifully Another reason why FF had a unique character design is because the characters had been introduced with some background information instead of the traditional way were they just introduce a character and thats that The way that characters developed in the game also had its strong points to back up many of the games likings The way that I first saw the game character wise was that each really didnt care about each other Once the story and overall plot thickened the characters attitudes towards each other became more appealing

Music
  The music in the game was also another high end of the game In my opinion the music of the game is what gave it that certain vibe to make it a higher end game I cant really say much about the music though it was excellent Overall Nobuo Uematsu did a very good at composing and producing the music of FF

Overall
  Final Fantasy  what more can I say This is one excellent RPG that I would recommend to anyone who is remotely interested in gaming The overall atmosphere that Final Fantasy  brings with it is incredible The overall mixture of what it represents varies from person to person Some people call this The greatest game of all time and I fully agree with this statement Gaming just doesnt get any better than this
The only only only only only only thing that I didnt like about Final Fantasy VII was the Materia system  It takes an eternity to master all of the Materia  Other than that this IS the greatest game everThe battle system could of been a lot better  Number one Theres too many battles in the first place  You take three steps you get in a battle  You walk two steps to get somewhere and you end up in a battle  You take one step most likely youll get in a battle  Also let me point out that once youre in a battle you cant move around  And plus summoning whatever it is youre trying to summon like Thunder or something you have to press eighty buttons just to summon it at once  Its hard to do  However I think that the game was engaging and never let ya go  It was entertaining and it is undoubtedly worth the twenty bucksbutthe battle system could of been a lot better Im sorryThe graphics are dated and the storys mediocre The game is still good Lets face it people There will never be a perfect RPG but this one is good Youve all heard the story yet heres whats great about it Really good side quests beliveable charecters and beatiful movies Whats bad is the plot the graphics and the last boss Thats it GoodbyeThis game was a bit of a let down compared to its predacessor Final Fantasy VI US III  Its still a good game the second best one from the three released for PS IX is the best of the PlayStation era  The dark realism pioneered by this game made for a good story and was much more well done than Final Fantasy VIII  The addition of FMV for the first time was also a nice new element  However the gameplay and story still fall short of Final Fantasy VI and IX  Worth a play especially since the price is good nowBeing a diehard Final Fantasy fan I just had to get this game  While I enjoyed it for the most part I was disappointed by the feel of the game for lack of a better term  It was not fantasy it was more science fiction and I really could have done without the awkwardlooking polygon characters  But the music is fantastic the storyline is moderately interesting and I think it just depends on what kind of gamer you are as to how much you like it  Most newer gamers really love it so if you are hesitant rent before you buy  They finally listened to us oldschool gamers and did us right with Final Fantasy IX though  MarvelousWhile being an excellent RPG it is not up to the caliber of the originals especially IIIUSVI  There is definaltely lots of eye candy with the excellent graphics and awesome FMV Where this game really lacks is in its replay value  Its a onetimer  I dont think I could bear to go though the whole thing again  There were too many things that were too tedious in the game namely the materia and chocobo development which they drastically improve with IX  Developing materia is an endless task that requires ungodly hours of play and the payoff ie master materia just isnt worth it  As for the Chocobo development while interesting at first it proved to be highly redundant as the game consistantly had a habit of birthing the wrong chocos and the races became more of a chore than a fun little sidequest  Overall though a good game not to terribly difficult if your not interested in finding all the secrets but only really worth playing onceThis was a very addictive game with lots of fun involved When I first saw this game I thought it would reek because the fighting scenes arent great But this game is a lot more than just fighting its an awesome RPG maybe one of the best Some of the bad language is not needed but its easy to look past that
 One thing that really bugged me was that in some parts it was just too hard and you could walk around for hours and not figure out what you were supposed to do But other than that it was great  You can actually play arcade games inside this game and there is even a place where you can shoot some hoops There is a big mix inside this you can drive a motorcycle a chocobo  and some hover crafts This game is really fun and has I think about  hours of gameplay on three different discs so go out and get yours today
JesseIf you like rally cars get this game you will have fun
It is more oriented to European market since here in America there isnt a huge rally fan party Music it is very European and even the voices from the game very English accent
The multiplayer isnt the best but it works just okFinal Fantasy  is another excellent game made by Squaresoft The same company that made Bushido Blade and Saga Frontier It was the reason many  people bought the Playstations they own and defiantly the one of the best  during the year it came out
As far as game play goes its excellent The  controls are standard to RPGs Combat basically is turn based which I  highly prefer with a little bar that goes up as it gets closer to your  turn It has several very fun minigames Also there are many characters  who show an actually personality during the game There are several  Vehicles you get as the game goes by to help you with your long trips  across the large world
As far as plot its well done Plot being the  most important part to an RPG its good to see this game was strongest in  this area Even though I wont reveal much on the plot I will tell you it  surprises you many times Like most RPGs you dont get a lot of control  over the plot but thats fine its still a good game The plot doesnt  start to shake and get lost around the end it keeps you stuck form  beginning to finish
The graphics are wonderful for their time However  newer games like final fantasy  Parasite Eve and Metal Gear Solid are  defiantly better Often the characters seem a bit boxy in it The  backgrounds almost always look beautiful though
And finally as far as  length of time it can stay interesting is a long time Final Fantasy  is  not a game you well beat in four or five games You well defiantly have to  buy this game to beat it Its well worth the price though
Overall this  game is good I am one of those selfimportant jerks who things ff was the  best though but it did come close It is defiantly worth playingThis is a classic that took fighting games to a new level Although i am a Mortal Kombat fan i admit that this game is actually cool to a certain point The second one is alot better and the third one is pretty sweet However you must remember the humble beginings of Super hero Street fighter games I like itThere is doubt about it this was the game that showed the dreamcast could be a major competitor  Being a big fan of the arcade version I must sayfor the billionth time that this one surapasses the arcade version  This is a very strategic fighting game  And it is extremely deep gameplay  Although my only compaint is that a button masher can beat the computer  That is my compliant about all d fighting gameas opposed to earlier Street Fighter And Street fighter alpa series games is that button mashing can get you over  Although in d fighting gameslike Tekken and of course Soul Calibur you cant pull off impressivebeautifulcombos with just button mashing  For the most part this game has alot of relay value lots of of unlockable characters The mssion mode which adds even more to replay value and the cool museum mode  In my opinion Time attack mode is useless  The survival mode while great is just too easy  Another problem the final Boss Inferno  He is pretty easy as well But this is common in d fighters  But all in all this is a solid fighting game It is just a bit too easy  Even ultra hard mode can be easily won by a competent Soul Calibur playeralthough button mashers can win the first two stages  This game is a musthave for Dreamcast ownersThis game was good but not great It was the very first MVC game and started the ball rolling I had this game for the Dreamcast and played it the arcade for awhile I thought it was pretty cool but just like XMen vs SF or Marvel vs SF but the difference was that people could call out special assists characters I give credit though for starting the idea of having  on  matches in MVCThere are secret ways to unlock alternate versions of some of the characters and even unlock Onslaught Youll have to beat the game using certain techniques In order to beat the game very easily I personally found it best to use Ryu and Venom on Easy mode Use them to beat the game multiple times and youll be able to unlock all of the secret characters

PROS
 The vibration feedback is extremely sensitive  You feel every bump and hit that you give your opponent
 There is an Easy mode which strangely is not in MvC part  The Easy mode allows you to use Chun Lis lighting fast kicks
 There are a few super moves that are not in MvC part  Like Chun Lis has four supers in this game while she has only three in part 

CONS
 There is a little slowdown with a few characters like War Machine and Strider These characters move a lot faster in MvC part 
 You can not select the same person twice In MvC part  you are allowed to select the same person so you may have a team of three Akumas or whomever else

Overall its a great game and I urge you to buy it even if you already own MvC part  I own both games and love them equallyUntil the Dreamcast came along no other system could handle the D graphic processing power of a lot of D games without a lot of loading  Marvel VS Capcom is better on the Dreamcast than it was in the arcades the control is easy the graphics are sharp and crisp and bright and the action is fast so fast you might lose track of what your doing  Though it was overshadowed by its superior sequel Marvel VS Capcom is a must own Dreamcast title on its own  Also recommended is Marvel VS Capcom  Power Stone  Capcom VS SNK Street Fighter Alpha  Dead or Alive  and Soul CaliburThis game is good and very entertaining I would give it five stars had there been more to it Make sure to play with a friend to truly appreciate itGood the price should have been cheaper for how old this game is Game was just the way I played it years agoCapcom continues to make great fighting games but this time out with Power Stone they create something special  Power Stone was one of the first Dreamcast games out for the Dreamcast and helped make the system worth buying  You can go anywhere grab anything and then beat the hell out of your opponent  Its a great game the only problem is that there is so much going on during the game you can lose your concentration at times but thats the only flaw  Otherwise its a great gameThis is one of the best fighting games that i have ever played other than killer instinct and i have to congratulate sega on it  The graphics are amazing there  are plenty of characters to choose from the levels are all varied and the two player mode has kept my friends and I busy for monthsSmackdownJust Bring It for the PS and Smackdown  and  for the PS are better But it is nothing compared to WWF Raw for the XBOX Raw for the XBOX is better than any of them But if you havent got a PS XBOX or Gamecube yet this is a must get game Gameplay is good it just takes a day or maybe a little more to get use to If you want to save money rent it and smackdown  or  and see which one you would want to have the mostI personally own this game and can testify to how good it is WWF attitude has eccellent character selection and create a player modefor its time Unfortunately it is getting lost in the shadow of games like Smackdwon  with its quick executing of moves unlike Attitude and its enormous backstage area unlike attitude But on the good side it has some things other games dont tag team Gauntlet and its huge hidden character selection that you are always trying to unlock Great game i would reccommend it to anyone who likes slowerpace gamesAllright I admit It When it comes to Gameplay This Game loses But When It Comes To Creating Wrestlers This Game Is Revolutionary The CreateAWrestler Feature On This Game Is So Detailed That You Dont Just Pick The Face You Pick The Eyes The Nose and The Mouth You Also Can Put Lettering On Your Clothing And Have A Wide Variety Of Masks FacePaint And Apparel With This Game You Could Create The LOD And Even The Insane Clown Posse The CreateAWrestler Mode Is So Detailed This Game Is Worth Playing Just For That I Only Wish That Modern Wrestling Games With CAW Mode Would Take a Page From This GameAbsolutely great game and it came in near perfect condition Now some of you may be wondering why I took one star off and that is simply due to the product coming in a day late on one day shipping As far as the game goes Id highly recommend this game to survival horror fans and Resident Evil fans alike Code Veronica and Code Veronica X are great changeling games within the series and despite it lacking features that were present in Resident Evil  it still manages to be just as good if not better than  which is one of my personal favorites in the seriesI really like this product It has a good looking And also it has a pretty good size I really like this productResident Evil Code Veronica

This was originally released on the Dreamcast and originally intended to be the third of the Resident Evil series However that went to what we now know as the excellent Nemesis game for playstation

This game was the first to be set in full D with no prerendered backgrounds This game has held up very well and the graphics are more polished on the PS and gamecube versions

It follows the story of Claire Redfield after the events of Resident Evil  and also reintroduces us to one of the heroes from the original game Chris Redfield It features new enemies weapons and entirely new locations

Something about the location didnt set right with me Oh I knowits not Raccoon City Well I guess they couldnt help that after Nemesis but still

I say this is where Resident Evil started to go down hill That doesnt mean this is a bad game but this doesnt feel as fresh as the others before it who still play great in  Id recommend this as it is better than Resident Evil Zero  and much better than Baio Hazard series have the most popularity in Japan Especially Code Veronica is one of the most favorite thing Because it game is  very real gurafic game used the spec of Dream Cast ability very well Even if it is now time that there are more great spec hard PS XBOX etc you can play the came with the joy and the satisfication
Vaio series is if I say to that simply a active horror and action game The main character of the game collect many weapons and curing items etc  you defeat the monsters that get to be stronger and storonger as story advance The weapon is real too For instance the sound of the bullets gravity feeling when the character have his gums at the ready
When you use your bullets there is fun that you consider the remaining bullets And the sound is the horror sound The monster are horror too
Thank you for reading poor writingGraphics wise this game is awesome The control is easy to get used to and it is fun
  The problems with this game begin early on The main problem is the puzzles and bosses There are many times when you will get stuck because you didnt move some block  hours ago of course you cant go back so your only alternative is to start over Very frustrating
Graphics 
Sound 
Fun 
Control This didnt have the best plot as the other res do but was a hell of alot challanging Your Claire Redfield looking for your brother Chris Redfield You meet Steve Burnquist who eventually dies im sorry to say I dont wanna spoil any more but anyway Your main goal is to survive on the umbrella base owned by Miss Veronica She is the master of all the ashfords which are a family of very wealthy people Youll meet Alexia and Alfred They are deadly so becareful The graphics are the best part Youll see a world of reality when you first see the first fmv The Plot is good but not the best And the handgun you get as your first weapon lol sux But you will not be dissapointed when you first turn the game on You also will play as Chris Later in the game so have fun while the game lastsResident Evil Code Veronica on the Dreamcast has the same mutantzombie killing and gore everyone would expect from a Resident Evil game  The graphics are considerably better in this latest installment of the series and there are plently of new monsters to exterminate As for the weapons there isnt much new herebut at least its kept relatively realistic with shotguns pistols and submachine guns ect The story is involved and although at some points predictable its executed well from start to finish  Unfortunately as in the other Resident Evil games there is a lot of back tracking that must be done to complete the gameand having limited item space makes it all the more time consuming  If youve played the previous Resident Evil games you know what to expect  Theres also plently of fun secrets to unlock like Battle Mode and they add a considerable amount of replay value  Resident Evil Code Veronica is yet another great reason to own a DreamcastNBA Showtime was the newest incarnation of the very popular and ongoing NBA JAM series except now it went a little more high scale because it takes the NBA on NBC jingles videos and of course the stills and visuals of the NBA on NBC TV programming
Like all NBA JAMs totally outrageous basketball from start to finish You can expect anything and everything in this one from more out of this world dunks to being On Fire shooting and of course the newly added alley oops and free throws Yes thats right no more shoving your opponents all over the place because now they get  foul shots each worth  points a piece and even Shaq can hit these free throws
You can even create your own character and build that character to be the best as you take on the entire NBA in  on  mayhem You also get to answer NBA trivia just like on TV during games Pretty cool
Id get this one because I personally think that this is NBA JAM at its best Very fun and also very cool to play with friends Especially if you and a friend are good enough to pull off the triple alley oop pass for Team Fire Again check it outVery great port of a very great gameit controlled for me fine Using the DPad to move and B to runit felt greatIt is only lacking the Extreme battle modebut everything else is there including some bonus documents that arent found in any of the other Resident Evil sThis is one of the better N games if you have the meg expansion pack and its good and creepy but some of the puzzles could have been a bit more easy to figure out but if you dont have an N get the GameCube remake as the Graphics are much better but still worth picking up and adding to your N collection I did not know  had a resident evil a friend of mines loan it to me oh boy this game was the first resident evil i ever played it was sweet and of course scary there are flaws the controls ect but you just got to love this game its real fun i think personally that this is the best resident evil everrr maybe its the  genre whatever you need to tell you self this game rocks i now have code veronica and outbreak so i know what i am saying be sure to get you doctor advise before playing its not a game for the weak at heart laterzzzzz gamers yyeeeeeeaaaaaahhhhhhhhhOh what fun for PlayStation to pick up rights to the classic PacMan game like they did for Sonic the Hedgehog  several other formerly popular characters Plus this is a great gameHappy Gamingthis game was good it actually has talking in it you dont have to read everything its pretty difficult in a way that its fun and its not too short there is a storyline to it the game works great no unable to read disc errors or anything like that

the only downfall is that if you have Pacman world  for GAMECUBE or PS you going to be slightly disappointed because Pacman world  is way better
but thats just my opinion

great buyTo be frank this is what got me hooked on PacMan  After I tried the original Mrs PacMan I wondered about the other version  Id heard good things about it and that it was a very good game but I wasnt so sure  Then I tried my cousins Game Boy version of it and I loved it too  Pretty soon I had forgot in favor of my now favorite video game series Crash Bandicoot  Then we went game shopping in Toys R Us and I saw it  The st thing that popped into my mind was Thats a Cool Looking PacMan  Since mny dad had said no more Crash games for a bit I asked him for this  I loved PacMan Worlds graphics game play controls worlds and the challenge  I was hooked

The storyline is quite simple  Its PacMans th anniversary and the Pac family is gearing up for it Theyre preparing a big party but suddenly guess who shows up and kidnaps them  Thats right the Ghosts  Their new boss TocMan wants to replace the Pac in all the titles of PacMans games with Toc thereby making himself the star of the series  So PacMan must rescue his family

I recommend this gameThe N port of the original NFL Blitz was such insane football game I recall renting it several times back in Blitzs heyday The players are so aggressive and you literally beat the other team to death all the way through

NFL Blitz  appears to be pretty much the same game with better graphics a play editor a person multiplayer and a roster update Like the original you have a series of passing plays that you use to gain  yards in  plays Also like the original all conventional rules regarding football have been thrown out the window Its a pretty wild ride

Right now in  if youre collecting N games for nostalgias sake or for whatever  Id say one of the consoles Blitz games is a good and necessary investment Theyre definitely core N games whatever that means However its not the kind of football game you can really sit down and enjoy too too much by yourself Its a lot of fun to just knock the daylights out of your friends in Blitz But alas the AI just cant provide the kind of reaction that makes it entertainingThere are usually too many football video games that try to bring more special graphics displays then the actual enjoyment of humor and feel of a actual enjoyable sports video game in the entire field of video games The only acception NFL Blitz is a perfect exception to the rule blending in some zany humor and some incredible things youd never expect to see in any real football game
NFL Blitz  the successful sequel to NFL Blitz contains all of the componens of each team in the AFC and NFC Also added to the mix are incredible zany stadiums that consist of playing football on a rooftop in the middle of a city to the classic style of an traditional stadium Also included are humorous codes that can change the game into a war zone Codes like No Interceptions changing the football into the size of an giant balloon and even super field goals can change the face of football time and time again It is just too bad that cant happen in the real game it would finally make sports fun
While many people are now into the games for Nintendos Gamecube for those who still own the Nintendo  really need to own this sports game It is just a first down to the ultimate gaming library Only if you still own the Nintendo  and didnt trade it in for a CDROM gaming system that takes longer to upload the game NFL Blitz  is that one kind of fantasy sports game that continues to bring in the touchdowns easilyDino Crisis is a great game  lots of excitement suspense and action  It doesnt fail there  I beat it in four days seven hours playing time though so definitely rent it first
Some of the voice acting is weak  but its not the worst out there  The story will keep you interested as  will the battles with the enemy dinosaurs  An added plus is the decisions  you must make at key points in the story but even this and the different  costumes isnt enough to give the game the replay value it needs to make  it a star gameIf you loved Resident Evil  and  you will love Dino Crisis Bult with the same operating engine as the RE games this classic scifi horror survival adventure keeps you excited while dodging raptors and scrounging for ammo
Be careful not to bleed out Seriously though not just a joke but an extremely annoying game mechanicYou can say this is resident evil with dinosaurs but its a little more than that Definitely scary Puzzles are a little complex and tricky Youll need a pen and paper to figure them out Cutscenes are awesome Monsters are quick here You no longer have the comfort of running away from a slow moving zombie Certainly challenging Four stars overall because this game is short but still worth it

I did play Dino Crises  and it was okay More of a shooter Wished Capcom stayed with the survival horror element They had a winner hereWhile some reviews hail this as a Resident Evil with Dinosaurs its much more than that The characters were greatand the story line is awesome The only complaints I had for this game were the camera angles some were very infuriating The game play is solid and this game is an instant classic I would recommend picking this game up at the cheap price it is being sold for before its too late Fast shipper as well and prompt serviceThis game isnt historically importantin the history of videogames its derivitive and flawed but I still had a lot of fun playing it Its like a good bmovie I tend not to like the graphics of playstation games I preferred the snes back in the day but here they work The graphics lean towards realism but have a hint of anime influence and I think they did a really great job on the dinosaur models and most of the animations are pretty expressive the limping of Regina when shes injured for example The grainyness of the graphics enhance the bmovie feel The voice acting isnt great but each character has a distinct personality I also enjoyed the item mixing system this allows you to customize the difficulty of the game you can choose to use weak items or level items There is also a decent amount of strategy in the game depending on the kind of weapon you use raptors will be unfazed stunned or knocked down depending on the strength of the weapon and there are also laser shields in some areas you can use to knock down raptors in order to run from them
Flaws the first and most serious flaw in the game is that the areas on the map arent labeled this is idiotic it means that when you find clues with room specific information then unless you have a great memory you wont know where to look Another problem is that sometimes important objects in the environment will blend in with the background and look unimportant there is a key slot that would have taken me hours to find if I didnt get annoyed and look at a game walkthough Sometimes the camera angles can hide important objects too There is also a problem with damage detection and hit point arithmetic a raptor wont take damage during some parts of its animation and if you get in some shot gun blasts then switch to the hand gun sometimes it wont count the damage done with the shotgun both of these issues waste bullets You cant group items how you want sometimes youll want to upgrade just one item but are forced to waste two others because of auto grouping The select sound effect gets annoying considering how often you have to go to your inventory The save system is slow and annoying The pace of the game gets stalled from puzzles sometimes youll be running for your life but then have to stop and do a puzzle and I never figured out the rules of the crane puzzle it just felt like trial and errorAround  this game hit shelves on the coat tails of the success of the famed Resident Evil series It even comes with a demo for Resident Evil  Nemesis That said this is not Resident Evil It has similar controls and a story a little too silly to understand but that is it

The game is dependant on your ability to craft darts or find bullets to kill the enemys of the game You will never have enough ammo to march through the compound and kill every enemy You will need to run close doors operate lazer gates and ect to get through this game

There are puzzles as well none that I can immediately remember except for the puzzle where you move cargo holds to make a path

The enemies are excellent This game has dinosaurs that look and feel like Jurrasic Park dinosaurs The raptors are vicious and terrifying the pterradactyles are a situational enemy but they are a thrilling challenge the domeheaded dinosaurs show up and kick your can and the Tyrannosaurus Rex is simply great The enemys are so well used in the game that they are completely plausable They take a great deal of damage and are fast and strong enough to rip you apart

I give this game praise for going away from the zombie threat and replacing them with something exceedingly more violent and threatening I love zombie games more than the next guy but this was just good The story was BMovie just like in Resident Evil and the enemys were terrifying and threatening The enviroments were dynamic and look really good on PS Very little did not work in the game and if ther was something then I cannot remember itNope the title of my review IS NOT misleading yes DC had a much better and more complete plot than either RE or RE RE not quiet as the scientific aura of the game sucks you in Anyway to get started Regina and her fellow comrades are out on Ibis Island in search of a man by the name of Professor Kirk Apparently hes got this new Third Energy Experiment which he is conducting I wont spoil as to what is behind this experiment as itll ruin the gaming experience The gameplay is similar to that of RE but instead of zombies you face dinosaurs You will NOT be dissapointed I must say Shinji Mikami has good taste when it comes to creating a game with a very good storyline

GameplayExactly like RE except you have D graphics instead of D
StoryIts very rare for a game to earn a good rating in this area
Replay Value Hey you have three different endings and replaying it gives a chance to experience the different possbilities
Suspense  This game is easily a victor in this department My hats off to Shinji for making this game more suspensful unlike its sucessor DCI am basically buying and beating old playstation games I never got a chance to beat I just finished this game today and it was pretty good The controls are prettymuch identical to the early resident evil series and so is gameplay really The story is pretty decent the only things I did not like about the game is it can become tedious running and back and fourth and some of the puzzles  not hard  are just kind of annoying Good pickup if you can find it for under  bucks and looking to waste a saturday with a   pack Game should take no more than  hours and thats really pushing itI remember back in  when I received Dino Crisis as a Christmas present This was my first exposure to a survival horror game Believe it or not I actually didnt bother with the Resident Evil series until six years later in the summer of  which is when I played Resident Evil  for the very first time

Now lets go back to  for a moment The world of D gaming was in full swing at that point in time  was a year when people were anxiously awaiting what the Playstation  would give us while at the same time we were appreciating what the original Playstation was offering The original Playstation as you may already know is where the survival horror genre really became popular Resident Evil Silent Hill and the now underrated and unfortunately forgotten Dino Crisis series

Over time people havent treated the Dino Crisis series with nearly as much respect as the Resident Evil and Silent Hill series It probably has something to do with Dino Crisis  being a really bad game with horrible camera angles which meant after that failed experiment hit the market people werent interested in any more Dino Crisis games But you know even before Dino Crisis  was released people didnt respect the Dino Crisis series as much as the other survival horror games I really have no idea why Dinosaurs can be just as cool as zombies Believe me Perhaps it has something to do with the animation Even though killing dinosaurs is fun and addicting Capcom made killing zombies slightly more interesting thanks mainly to better animation from pointing and shooting your guns at a zombies head It just looks and feels better in Resident Evil  This in NO WAY should be reason to avoid Dino Crisis This also doesnt mean Dino Crisis is flawed in the shooting department Both Resident Evil and Dino Crisis offer tons of enjoyment TONS of enjoyment They are just separate beasts

The original Dino Crisis is supposed to be about making the right decisions when it comes to either keeping your ammo and health in one place or making the decision to bring the ammo and health with you Its supposed to be about guessing whether or not the ammo or health will eventually be necessary as you progress through the game However on easy mode none of this makes a difference The game is so easy on easy mode that you can literally get attacked by dinosaurs about five or six times before you even need one of those Med Pack Ms used to bring your health back to  Seeing as how there arent many dinosaurs in the game overall you will only need to use one of these health packs maybe two or three times throughout the entire game Dino Crisis is that easy  This means you will only have to bring one or two Med Packs with you and leave the rest behind

To be fair you cant just mindlessly shoot every dinosaur you arrive to because you arent given a whole lot of ammo Certainly not as much ammo is given to you compared to how many health packs are available throughout the journey Despite that running out of bullets probably wont ever be a problem  Just make certain you avoid some of the weaker dinosaurs in the early parts of the game That way you will have enough bullets for the bigger and deadlier dinosaurs in the later parts of the game which obviously require more bullets to kill

You are given the ability to mix things together to create dangerous darts These darts are used to kill dinosaurs very quickly sometimes in a single shot The problem here is that on easy mode the game is so simple that mixing darts together isnt even important You dont have to worry about dartmixing on easy mode at all You can simply shoot or avoid all the dinosaurs you come across on easy mode and not have to worry about dartmixing EVER That kind of ruins the whole survival horror aspect of the game  You should have been required to use at least one or two of these darts

People criticize Dino Crisis  for being just a mindless shooting game where you have to kill as many dinosaurs as possible to progress to the next area and collect bigger guns but the honest truth is the original is a MUCH easier game overall because you can simply run past all the dinosaurs that stand in your way You cant do that in the second game You have to stand up to them and shoot So Dino Crisis  is a harder game in my opinion Oh sure you are given an option to up the difficulty in both Dino Crisis games but the problem here is that the difficulty goes up SIGNIFICANTLY making the game nearly impossible

Another problem I have with the game is the amount of cutscenes You CANNOT skip over them so you are forced to watch almost every single one of them Most of them are kind of boring because most of the cutscenes feature the main characters just talking to each other Sometimes you will see a coollooking dinosaur attacking something though But Capcom really should have given you an option to skip over the cutscenes like they did in the sequel because most of them are flatout boring These conversations are supposed to create a spooky mood but it doesnt work in my opinion

I also have a problem with the INCREDIBLE amount of puzzles you come across I am not kidding theres over  puzzles in this game Some of them are just a matter of typing in the correct series of numbers or the correct words to access the next area Some of the puzzles are more along the lines of finding the right way to complete them such as the puzzle where youre pushing these Up Down Left and Right buttons to figure out how to sucessfully lift up and put down boxes using a giant crane These are extremely hard puzzles to figure out by yourself unless you have a walkthrough  Once you figure them out the sequence is exactly the same the next time you play the game though  Theyre not random like in Resident Evil 

The game is also very heavy on searching for the correct key cards to gain access to the next part of the game which can be annoying Simply put the game is dominated with puzzles and key cards which are always required to access the next area  A bit much to say the least

Despite the above problems Dino Crisis is STILL a pretty fun game because the dinosaurs are animated beautifully and the graphics as a whole are really good for  as well The actual gameplay has some problems mentioned above but theres also plenty of action to be found Also the game is pretty scary and intense and the dinosaurs are simply wonderful looking and its interesting the way they can attack you because they attack differently each time Sometimes they will bite at your arm other times they will pick you up from off the ground and more

Oh and the music and sound effects are amazing  Perhaps the best music and sound effects in a survival horror game ever Instead of featuring melodic themes you are treated to sound effects and musical notes that seem to play randomly almost making it sound like improvised music like something from a King Crimson record  This means if you listen to the music carefully you can hear a bunch of unusual and creepy sound effects in the background  You hear something different each time  Its awesome and works great  Its not a typical soundtrack in any shape or form even by survival horror standards  Its so good

Overall even though Dino Crisis has almost zero replay value and too much time is spent running around inside a facility doing one puzzle after another and collecting one key card after another the game is worth the experience  Its not a classic just a nice gameHaving played a rather large number of survival horror titles in my time I uncovered this title at the local flea market for  bucks Having missed it back on the ps days I was too busy with Silent Hill and Resident Evil I guess and being a die hard fan of Survival Horror I picked it up First and for most many people have claimed this to be Rresident Evil with dinosaurs Dont get me wrong the similarities are hard to miss but this really is something unique Enimies are fast the slow moving zombie has been replaced with the screeching agile adreniline fueled velociraptor Which makes this game pretty difficult No think about it RE controlls only with zombies that move faster than you Get the picture While this does ramp the difficulty significantly it isnt too over bearing You just have to learn that blasting dinos isnt a good idea and running away is Despite the more frentic combat the game still moves at a sluggish pace that survival horror players have either come to love or hate This is due in large part to a vast number of puzzles which make little sense as usual colored key cards statues crate moving etcand back tracking in true RE fashion However this game offers some really chilling atmosphere and despite the slow moving speed it really does feel faster and more frentic than its compitition just because dinos are everywhere you are always running and usually have an extremely low ammount of ammo at all times Because nearly every area has key items you have to explore Because these same areas feature dinos you have to use ammo to kill them Because dinos are so fast and hard to kill you are always taking damage You use healing items to cure wounds so there for unlike Resident Evil it is pretty damn hard to hoard ammo and healers all this results from fast moving enemies and because you almost always just barely escape every situation by the seat of your pants this gives dino crisis an exciting edge that most other horror games still havent perfected Add to this choose your own adventure style twists in the plot where you call the shots as to which direction the story goes the ability to combine items to create more powerful weapons new types of ammo and more potent healing items and some pretty nifty graphics they really arent that bad considering this game is almost  years oldand you have a winning title As for the notsojuicy parts well there are only about  types of enemies And if you ever saw Jurassic Park or opened up a childrens Dinosaur book you already know what they look like and how they will act Im not complaining because each dino still scares the crap out of you when it pops out of a vent shaft or chases you down a corridor at high speed but they lack that whatthehellisit factor of the mutants seen in RE and Silent Hill Before you ever encounter them you already know exactly what the enemies will look like and how they will try and kill you It just isnt as disturbing as the freekish encounters experienced in most other games of the genre More so the weapon selection is a little limited  weapons Pistol Shotgun Grenade Gun which offer a nice balance of speed ammo availability and power but it still leaves something to be desired as pistol ammo is far too week to be useful  to  hits for a kill on a fast moving enemy yeah right and shotgun ammo is far to scarce to be wasted on anything but important circumstances obviously grenades are saved exclusively for bosses if you actually want to beat the game A good middle ground weapon would have been nice just to lower frustration and make combat more streamlined In short if you never liked Survival Horror this isnt going to turn you into a fan But if you like the corridor romping the solving of mundane puzzles that pop out of no where and a few heart pounding marrathon runs while being chased by savage lizards this is a game you should check out Dated by todays standerds but still decient enough to replay to see the  different endings I give it a solid  out of As my first forray into the world of survival horror I was very curious to see how this game would hold up in this age of Playstation s and Halo  I am pleased to say that this is a pretty fun game that has its strenghts and weaknesses
You play as a secret agent named Regina  Your mission is to infiltrate Ibis island to find a mysterious scientest named Dr Kirk  Upon landing on the island it quickly becomes obvious that there is something very wrong with the island  Then it becomes a quest to survive the evil reptillian menace
Many many people have complained about how dino crisis should be called puzzle crisis  It is true that there is an unusual amount of puzzles in the game that you must solve to advance  They range from simple switch the batteries to the moderatly difficult move the crates with a crane to the quite difficult Rotate electronic chips to divert power  There are also a mamoth amount of keys that you must get Around   There are also DDK locks that you have to dechiper to unlock doors Hence the title of this review  Most of these puzzles can be solved moderatly easily if you really think about it  Overall Id say that the game is a  mix of puzzles and dinosaur action
As for the fighting part of the game you get a total of three weapons Shotgun handgun and grenade gun to exterminate raptors pteradons etc  Some people might be turned off at the idea of only  weapons but I dont find it a problem  Combat is handled in the RE control scheme which works pretty well  As with a lot of survival horror games you have to be carefull as to how you make your way through with ammo which is not unlimited Except in  case  Fighting the dinosaurs can be difficult but mastered  Overall Id give the combat a B
There are some things to really like about Dino Crisis  At certian points during the game you have to make decisions aka Choose your own adventure style Do you investigate the underground area or go save a comrade  This adds a nice touch of replay value  The graphics are pretty good By PS standards  The best part of the game however is the Trex  The Trex provides the most exciting elements in the game and each encounter is a adrenaline charged rush  Likewise the  possible different endings are all very exciting and cool to play through although there are a few things I am curious about  For example Spoiler how can a Trex swim  miles an hour in water  That dosent make much sense End Spoiler
The weak points of the game are mostly the puzzles  There are a bit too many of them and not enough dino battles  Also the devlopers throw puzzles at you when you least suspect it and when you dont want them  While racing to a heliport for example a big race against time with tense dramatic music the game tosses a box pushing puzzle that you have to solve to advance  Another time you have to solve  big puzzles in the span of  minnutes where you have to power an elevator then move cranes when they are only  minnutes apart  Also the unlockable minigame you earn if you beat the game in under  hours is dissapointing At least to me  The element of strategy is unwelcome I just want to blast dinosaurs and not worry about ammo and Why isint the Trex included
overall I think that Dino Crisis is a fun game and a good start to the world of Survival horror  I recomend picking it up if you find it for uner  
The good
good graphics

some really difficult puzzles
not enough dino action
mediocre mini game See aboveLet me give it to you really short and sweet Did you like Resident Evil Then you will like Dino Crisis its Resident Evil with dinosaurs All Capcom did was change the characters and instead of shooting zombies you get to shoot and kill raptors and other dinosaurs that are trying to eat you
I myself am a fan of Resident Evil so for the price this is a cool game The same problems from RE come with Dino Crisis however lack of ammo Besides this its a fun game lots of puzzles to figure out and lots of shoot first ask questions later type of funI loved this game I like the fact of killing smart and fast dinos alot more than killing stupidretardedslow and mindless zombies It makes the game a little more challenging and this game has so many surprises going from raptors poping out from a corner to rip your face off all the way to a gient TRex busting through a window to bite you in half I must say that this game is very gory but in a way still cannot compare to the goryness of RE games I bet though that your wondering why I called this one of the best survivalhorrors when I have only givin it  stars instead of a perfect  Wellthe game seems to have to much puzzle solving and not enough killing dinos Like there is about a dino in every hall and in a few rooms but after you kill them all your stuck with about  puzzles to open a new area and then you finally get the opportunity to kill a few more dinos and then the same proccess over and over  puzzles dinos puzzles dinos But heylook on the bright side The graphics are very greatalong with the sound and awesome FMVs and the game also has its great and fun moments like when the TRex comes out In this game the TRex plays a simmilar role such as the Nemises does in RE because they are both constant enemys that keep showing up to ruin your day and they seem invincable This annoys some because of the same boss showing up over and over but I think its greatPlus if you have played RE and got annoyed by the Nemises showing up over and overyou may like this a little better because in here the TRex does not show up as near asmany times as the Nemises does Aside from the TRex and the Raptors there are  other deadly dinos One is the small and very very annoying Compyswho show up and theres about  of them you gota kill which wastes a great deal of your ammo Anouther is the flying bird dinosI dont know how to spell there namesand last but not the leastthese very very strong and very bigbigger than a raptor anyways but way smaller than the TRexwierd looking things that I do not have a clue to what there names are Ohnow I would like to get to the ammo Ammo is very very hard to find in this gameand there is not even that much to findBut I suggest to you to get and infit ammo cheat because youll need it for this game This games AIartificial intellagenceis very good The dinos are smart and if you are bleeding they can smell it all the way from a different hall and start stalking you So over all this is a great horrorsurvival that has somwhat littlebut good action none the less Buy ityoull love itexept if your not good at solving puzzles
  bye nowThis game is fun dont get me wrong but the problem is that this game offers nothing new to the style of game created by Capcoms own Resident Evil series  Basically its the same story youre trapped on an island where dinosaur research has run amuck and your goal is the escape before getting devoured by the many dinosaurs youll run accross while playing this game  ALong the way youll have to also solve some puzzles to be able to escape the island  So basically if you enjoyed Resident Evil or any of its clones Dino Crisis is a game for youMakers of RE bring us  Dino Crisis  The graphics musick backgrounds do look pretty good You play a redhead babe Regina and have to blast your way through all these blood thirsty dinos It gets hard at times but after you play it a few times youll be all set This also has decent replay value as well you get more costumes and an infinite grenade launcher so you can play again and blast all dinos Reginas other costumes are really cute as well especially the cavegirl one and she looks  yummy What else can I say DC is worthy of purchase although its somewhat on the mediocre side RE fans will likeThese things work really great and can be combined for even longer cable lengths but be warned that the rubber shielding seems to slip around the plug head Not a big deal but could lead to eventual shortThe good great game library the physical design of the machine is ace graphics on the machine are generally quite nice  player support VGA output
The bad the controllers even when brand new in box its kind of unreliable sometimes I have to flip mine upside down with certain discs its loud really loud library is too smallIts a nifty little console however it makes a really menacing grinding noise whenever its loading a disk Im not sure if thats normal because Ive never owned a Dreamcast before and It also sounds like the internal cooling fans are having a hard time cooling it Im glad I made the purchase however I am uncertain of the longevity of its life

It arrived in a medium sized box and it had like  layers of saran wrap on it which was kind of annoying to peel off but I suppose it did its job in keeping the console safe and the console itself is only a little bigger than the controller

I highly recommend this console I gave it a  because theres a few errors with my console but only minor ones like having to reset the internal clock EVERY TIME I turn it on long loading times on games the grinding noise which I might add my PS started making before it died and the cooling fan I feel like I should also add that it had a bit of trouble picking up the controller the first time I used it but that was easily fixable

Overall its a great console that I would recommend to people who want to experience some history in gaming without the loss of content from an N cartridgeI got this mainly to play Resident Evil CV Carrier and a few other games so didnt use it as much as my other consoles To be honest it just didnt have many games I was interested in The console itself was heavy When held it felt like a solid well designed piece of hardware It has four controller ports for multiplayer which is a plus I thought it was a competent game console though did have an issue with the controller It seemed poorly designed or at least for the games I was playing Other than that I thought it was a decent consoleIts obviously not the best console but since Ive bought it Ive had a ton of fun with it and consider it a great collectors console The Sega Dreamcast has a lot of great games like Sonic Adventure Sonic Adventure  Soul Caliber Jet Grind Radio Blue Stinger and Carrier to name a few of my favorites A Dreamcast is definitely worth picking up online or at your local storeI sold my dreamcast years ago and had regretted it ever since I was pleased with this purchase and it has worked well so farI really like this product It has a good looking And also it has a pretty good size I really like this productOverall this is a well done racing game with very good graphics for its time period My family has has enjoyed playing it a great deal I personally think a steering wheel controller is almost a necessity for this game but an x box type controller would probably work The keyboard would be almost impossible and not very fun The windows live system detracts greatly since you must log in and be online to play or save game progress There was a mees up with my Live log in and the game would no longer accept my activation code and I had to rebuy the game if I wanted to play There is no customer support at all Dirt  suffers from this serious flaw as well   star game  star Windows Live featureAfter replaying both RE and RE from my childhood days I couldnt wait to buy RE since I had missed that one growing up and was dying to try it out Well Ive had the game for a few nights  hours gameplay and have already beaten it And I gotta say it was a fun ride but Im kind of disappointed Im a huge Resident Evil fan and Ive been wanting to play this game for years

Dont get me wrong the game was very entertaining and still withheld the ability to scare the hell out of me I did enjoy it a lot but it just doesnt justify itself as much of a sequel in my opinion

Heres why

First off whats up with the difficulty modes Youre only given two choices Hard or Easy And their both screwed up Why

EASY MODE
 The game starts you Jill off with an assault rifle and  FAid sprays
 Enemies are way too easy to shrug off
 Jill can take up to  bites from a zombie and still be in Fine condition
 You have infinite ink ribbons
 All of the weapons in the game are already unlocked and located in your storage crate
 You have massive amounts of ammo for each gun already in the storage crate And Im talking MASSIVE For example  Handgun rounds  Shotgun shells and   AR clips
 Picking up ammo Gun powder and health items is pointless since you already have enough of each to last you to the end of the game
 It is not much of a challenge

Needless to say I quickly changed from Easy to Hard mode after the first  minutes of playing I usually dont like playing Hard mode on any game But it didnt leave me much of a choice and being a RE veteran I figured I could handle it In other words Easy mode was obviously designed for newbies and people that absolutely SUCK

HARD MODE
 You start with almost no ammo at all
 Jill takes too much damage even from the smallest attacks
 The new dodging feature is nearly impossible to use
 Nemesis is way too strong and can kill you in one or two hits
 Jills inventory is very small Unlike the first Resident Evil
 Zombies respawn after you enter and exit a room True considering the situation and environment does make sense Like its impossible to kill every zombie in the city

Nonetheless I completed the game on Hard Having died  or  times being annihilated by Nemesis My only question is why wasnt there a Normal or Original mode to play I like to be challenged and enjoy the game at the same time Playing on Hard was difficult and irritating Especially when you have an  ft monster on your tail most of the time

Secondly the story

STORY
To sum it all up the story is about Jill desperately trying to escape Raccoon city alive And the first part of the story actually takes place like a day before the events of Resident Evil  The main conflict in the story is that Umbrella corp has secretly dispatched a mutant tyrant called Nemesis into Raccoon city to seek out and destroy all the remaining STARS members Namely Jill and Brad Vickers I wont spoil the ending for anyone and I think most RE fans know what happens anyway

What I didnt like about the story was that it was too confusing Like who is Nemesis Where did he come from I mean seriously whats his origin Also in RE Leon and Claire were looking for Chris who we later discovered had traveled to Europe But your telling me that Jill was in the city the whole time And not once did Leon and Claire cross paths with her Come on

Another thing that doesnt make sense keep in mind this is before RE is when Jill makes her way into the RPD building only to find that half of the doors are boarded upbarricaded having no access Which would contradict REs plot altogether How would Leon and Claire get around the building It doesnt make any sense Why didnt they just have all of the doors Jill didnt need to go in locked The story itself is pretty clustered And its really not even a story its more like a sidestory It just seems that it was really rushed through and not a lot of thought was put into it

Thirdly the Nemesis

NEMESIS
Despite what I said earlier I thought that Nemesis was a great addition to the game He definitely adds to the suspense and you never know when or where hes going to pop up and surprise you However it doesnt take long to get tired and frustrated with him Mainly because there were a lot of areas in the city that I wanted to explore but couldnt because I was being pursued by Nemesis And he shows up like  minutes apart from each appearance So exploring or not hell always turn up sooner or later And yes you can fend him off But theres really no point since hes nearly impossible to kill and your only wasting precious ammo and health trying to fight him  By the way some of you may remember Mr X from RE well theres a big similarity between the two Their both huge mutant zombies that stalk you throughout the game So its quite obvious that Nemesis was a variation of Mr X

Pros
RE did improve and add some great new features Such as The new dodge feature that really adds to the gameplay and helps a ton when your in combat It took Capcom  games to finally add the  degree spin which enables you to turn around quickly and run to avoid danger I also liked the new Gun powder mixing feature which enables you to create ammunition for your weapons There is a lot of action and surprises in the game Adding the interactive environmental objects explosive barrels etc was a nice feature and really helped in difficult situations I did really like the outdoor environment in the game I thought that was a nice breakaway from the first two games And finally you dont need to press the action button to go up or down a flight of stairs

Cons
The graphics are the same as in RE and RE only with slight improvement on the character models and design The prerendered environments dont look as good or dark as in RE but are still nice The game itself is very short compared to the first two and the only playable character is Jill The camera angles can get annoying sometimes especially when there is an enemy blocking your view This problem is in the first two games also It wasnt as scary exciting or suspenseful as RE and RE But still has moments that make you jump out of your seat And lastly it lacks a story

Conclusion
Bottom line RENemesis is a good game Its fun scary and entertaining And no its not the best and in my opinion its the weakest game in the series And anyone who disagrees obviously hasnt played the first two But I will cut it some slack because Resident evil  had a lot to live up to And it was because Resident Evil  really set a high standard for the series Lets face it Resident Evil  was a legendary game and quite possibly the greatest sequel to any video game in history I just think that RE could of been a better sequel And it isnt as good as its predecessor

Final Rating As I have mentioned before in my past reviews I did not and will not buy Resident Evil  or Resident Evil  for Gamecube I just dont feel like they gave the fans what they could have given them In the fact that Resident Evil Remake for Gamecube is far better than the original Resident Evil on PSX 

That out of the way lets slip once again into the Survival Horror genre with Resident Evil  To be flatouthonest I loved this game from begining to end Never once did I find myself annoyed or slowed down with any problems while playing this game The graphics and sound are not much more than Resident Evil  gave us BUT the game itself seems to flow seemlessly with RE  in every aspect

I feel that Capcom hit the nail on the head with this game as they did with Resident Evil  heck thus far they have done a real bang up job making these games In closing all I can tell you is that not trying Resident Evil  would be a mistake as the game has everything in it that you would need for a heartpounding experience of funResident Evil  Nemesis adds a nice touch to the Resident Evil formula Not only do you have to deal with oncoming hordes of zombies but now you have another worrybeing chased by a Nemesis that will come after you no matter what you do to try and stop it The addition of Nemesis made this game one of the most enjoyable and my favorite of the Resident Evils The addition to now be able to walk up stairs without pressing a button really did help way back when though wondering how that was ever not a feature in the games is a bit of a puzzlement And on the subject of puzzles the only flaw this game has is the water puzzle near the end of the game Only because it is totally random Meaning you can get lucky and solve it in  seconds or it could take about  minutes to beat But other than that this is a great game that any Resident Evil fan should have in their collection NnyCW for CapCityResident Evil   Capcoms third installment of their famous survival horror series

When Capcom unleashed the original Resident Evil on the PSX back in the spring of  they had no idea that it would become one of their most successful franchises to date In fact the series is still going strong to this day with new games on the PS and Gamecube So Capcom heeded the fans calls for a sequel and released RE a couple years later This game ended up being much greater than the original and won over many more gamers with its intense action and edgy suspense After RE received much success it wouldnt be long before another sequel would be in the works Come the fall of  RE would make its appearance

The first thing most gamers will notice is that RE isnt intended to be a full blown sequel but rather more of a side mission designed specifically for veterans of the first two games who thought they were two easy and wanted something more challenging Plus it would buy time for the next real sequel RE Code Veronica Its quite clear that Capcom had this group of fans in mind when designing the third game There are two difficulty settings and although RE isnt intended for newbees of the series the easy mode does give you plenty of ammo to survive most of the game without any problems Hard mode on the other hand is VERY tough and it teaches you to conserve ammo and health items until they are absolutely needed And even though it was always important to save the game in the past its STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that you do it here because its that tough The action is certainly more challenging and it offers a plethora of small improvements over the other games

The games only real downfall comes from the fact that the story isnt anywhere near as compelling as the other games as it just takes place in the same time frame as RE Well specifically the first half of the game starts a day before the events of RE and then the second half picks up several days after that game Basically the plot consists of Jill Valentine star of the first game and thankfully NOT played by the same voice actress trying to escape the streets of the TVirus infested Raccoon City all the while avoiding getting killed by the Nemesis a crazed rocket wielding monster whos out to kill STARS members Theres nothing really surprising to the story although Jill does encounter numerous mercenaries from Umbrellas evacuation fighting squad Carlos is the only one Jill spends the most time with and he resembles sort of a love interest for her Capcom doesnt really succeed as much with these two as say the relationship between Ada and Leon or the young girl Sherrys affection towards Claire both in the previous game Still there are multiple paths and different endings to achieve so plenty of replayability is here Thankfully any fallacy of the story is more than made up for by the gameplay

If youre already a fan of the action from the first two RE games then youll love RE because there are a TON of additions to make the action segments more enjoyable For instance you can now dodge enemies attacks and utilize a quick turn so that running around is a lot easier to do Plus there are now interactive environmental items that you can fire at to cause damage to enemies Theres nothing more satisfying than being chased by a group of  zombies and then suddenly taking them all out by firing a single shot at an explosive BANG How cool is that BTW zombies can now run after you and chase you up stairs so watch out Another cool feature is the ability to create your own type of ammo by collecting and mixing different gunpowders Even on hard mode with the right combinations you can end up with a LOT of heavy firepower

As for the graphics sound and music they are all nearly identical so read my comments on them in my RE review to get the synopsis Same with the music although I will comment on the effectiveness of the music when the Nemesis arrives Its quite scary when you leave the room that the Nemesis inhabits and then slow eerie music starts playing You know that the Nemesis is nearby and will attack you at any time This aspect was done very well

Theres only one playable character this time but the game lasts at least  hours depending on how fast you go Not to mention that items and monsters are randomly placed each time you play the game RE does improve on the lack of challenging puzzles from the last game by featuring ones that have random outcomes each time In fact one puzzle toward the end of the game took nearly an hour to solve The scare factor isnt quite as high as in RE but a new fear element is introduced and revolves almost entirely around the Nemesis when hes chasing you The first time I played the game I thought that killing the Nemesis was impossible but now I know that even on hard mode you can still best him if you use your resources properly After the game is done theres still plenty of unlockable goodies to acquire such as a timed battle mini game different outfits and numerous epilogues to explain the story further

Overall if youve mastered the first two games and hunger for more then by all means pick up RE Its not perfect but any older fan will find this game worthwhile However NEW FANS SHOULD START WITH THE OTHER GAMES FIRST BEFORE TACKLING ON THIS ONE AS THEY MAY FIND RE TO BE FRUSTRATING HIGHLY RECOMMENDEDlooks good but it has no batteries for me to test the buttons but the screen works for games when in the controllerThis product has worked out well along with the other dreamcast items ive recently purchased Does what it says and works just fine for my dreamcast needsI like the direction Sega took memory cards At the time I really thought it was the future of controllers and memory cards I mightve been half right I guess I would give this item a five star if it werent for one thing that I really dont blame Sega for It uses a lithium battery and for some reason mine always seemed to die before I even noticed Its too bad Sega had some good ideas that were just harder to execute at the timeNice Game Fun  Easy to Play  Overall Rating  Stars

Nice Game Fun  Easy to Play  Overall Rating  StarsThis review is actually in reference to both the Dreamcast version and the Playstation version For PS  RE  offers some of the best graphics available on the system on DC the graphics are a sore disappointment as there were only minimal improvements and while it does look better on the DC there are other enhancements that I would have implemented This game had scared me when I rented it on the PS  so bad that I set it aside It had got my heart racing the whole running away and running for dear life and me without a guidebook Several years later I buy the DreamCast version just to complete the collection and while waiting for the remake of RE  for my GCN I dust this game off and played through it without a guidebook This time I didnt get spooked at all I was up pretty late that night I got scared anyway
RE  Nemesis focuses more so on action than anything else and there is thankfully more than enough ammo and herbs to go around I think that this is probably the easiest of the Resident Evil games not saying that you wont encounter the You Died screen on occasion but less often than in other installments This is also the shortest game in the series The voice acting is dramatically better than previous games as well as the in game cut scenes a little more fleshed out However the story is not as fleshed out as it should have been The game does have some advantages It is the first game to allow you to ascend and descend stairs without using the action button and it was the only game of the series to have a functional dodge button which was great I also enjoyed the gunpowder mixing All in all this game is a lot of fun short but sweet and although it is not the pinnacle of the series it is a worthy sequel Plus the DreamCast version has more than enough extras to keep a person busy for a while Lie RE  this game is being ported to GCN with minimal improvements I only wish that Capcom would consider a total remake of this game as well with more story elements If future installments of RE are to keep the tank like movement than I hope that they will reincorporate the dodge buttonI am a Dreamcast holdout  And I am proud of it  The DC iswas the new Resident Evil Machine and every game in the series except for  was on it  Which brings me to Resident Evil 
This is the Survival Horror god  RE is perhaps the most scaryinsert shocking here game of the series I have played yet  Rather than face several boss charactors at obvious areas Nemisis the big bad boss of this game will literally chase you throughout the game  I still remember fondly the first time I saw his distorted face  And I remember well his tenacious persuit of me causing my fingers to curl and my stomach to clench  He is scary
Added to Nemisis himself is the wonderful useful dodge ability  Tired of Zombies walking through your hail of fire to rip open your neck  Charge them and push them back  Tired of spiders wraping their legs around you and pumping you full of poison  Jump aside  It is so nice to actually roll out of the way of a enemies swinging claws  And RE is the only game so far where you get to do this
Finally the gripes  Although I have not played  RE is the shortest of the series I have played  It is also much less epic than  or Veronica  If it is lengh and amazing story you are looking for go for RE code Veronica  But is you want to be gripping the armchair seat and shivering from overdose excitementThis is the game for youFor anyone who has not played this stellar game series this is what you call a survival horror game which means you have a gun you are alone and you have s of zombies dogs ravens monsters and mutants after you The third installment of the Resident Evil game series actually takes place before the second game so you are writing the future playing as the lead heroine Jill who survived the first game You start out on the streets of Raccoon City which has been ravaged by zombies and you work your way to the Police Station and back into the city streets trying to escape the town all the while being stalked by a huge ugly killer which appears every once in a while to give the player a scare Unlike the other two games Jill is armed to the teeth right when you begin the game She has a handgun shotgun magnum and an assault rifle however unlike the original two games there are not waves of zombies to go through instead there are only a few zombies but the city streets are like a maze so there is lots of ground to cover There are only a few improvements made from the first two games In Resident Evil  there were only  types of zombies with this game there are dozens of zombies such as fat zombies beautiful zombies and so on There is also a new system where you can make bullets for certain guns but there is no chance you will ever run out of ammo Another nice addition is that the player can dodge attacks without the players help The graphics and sound are still excellent but several graphics were taken straight from Resident Evil Just as the title of my review says  It was a cool and original sort of innovative idea that went underrated and underused  But at the end of the day all I needed was a gadget to save my Dreamcast game files and it does that perfectlyThe final instalment of the series on Playstation  doesnt disappoint This is a classic game an all time great Although not as good as its two prequals Res Evil  makes up for it with improved graphics and an amazing mercenaries game The hard mode also offers the most difficult of challenges ever seen on the PS One If you are a fan of the series then you MUST own this Some gamers may feel its too easy iof they complete the game but try it on Hard Mode and then try the mercenaries and you get all the challenge you could ever ask for The only reason why Ive given  stars instead of  is the basic fact Res Evil  and  are both better But dont let that stop you buying it this is a game that offers challenge new enemies harder puzzles and throws further into the series evil intricate plot A classic gameOK this game was great  The time line is very interesting in this game cause it takes place before and into the same time period of RE  The added feature of having the main boss chase you the entire game gives the game a interesting challege  Just when you get all relaxed and are on a roll killing zombies the music changes and your hear STARS So now you have a very ugly mean disgusting thing chasing from room to room  Ne ways this game is great a definant must buy for any fan of the series  And a great game for beginnersthis game is excillent the graphics are top notch the game is chalinging but not to hard it is just a great game why did I only give it  stars because the stupid voice acting and why do the characters always move thair hands like that do you know anyone who waves thair hands in slashing motions while they talk If they would stop the hand movements and tried harder on the voices the game would be perfict Dont let the voices discurage you from buying this game thair is so much to this game let me talk about replay value almost every puzzle in the game is random so you cant just use the same solutions every time through the game Let me talk about the nemesis hes a ftI think tall monster that makes frankenstein look like a whimp with a tenticle that spews poison at you and equipped with a cannon He sounds dangerious you face him more than wonce in this adventure After much time playing this game you could tell capcom put much time in this enemy and he has the only voice in the game that is not annoing as he only says starsIn Res Evil two you had two discs of stuff to get done one playing as Leon and the other as Claire In this one you are Jill Valentine and you cant really pick anyone else
Still the weapons in this game improved a great deal You get the standard pistol shotgun etc but there are improved bullets to be made more powerful shotgunspistols M rifles and so much more Also each time you defeat Nemesis in the hard level he gives you a peice to a gun you wont find in the game or something cool like that Then there is the Mercenaries game after you beat the actual game through the first time Mercenaries is a little bit redundant but if you keep at it you can buy unlimited ammo start with automatic weapons and more This means any gun you find in the game never runs dry and believe me the first time through the hard level youre going to WANT more ammo Besides as you obtain more powerful weapons you can swat Nemesis like a pesky fly with the missile launcher mow down Zombies with the Magnum or massattack with the mini gun
The story is pretty much get outta Dodge but the added affects of meeting various survivors here and there is kind of cool although some of the survivors are not always the good guys Also each time you beat the game you get another peice of what is happening with Leon Claire Barry and more
Id suggest this one I played it for a solid month even after I beat it and Im still playingAfter having pretty bad luck with trilogies see Twisted Metal  I was somewhat wary about renting Resident Evil   I mean how could they top a  classic like Resident Evil   And thats where RE is hurt  its  overshadowed by its perfect predecessor and to do anything but copy it  would be less than perfection  Given all this Resident Evil  is still a  fun and very scary game  The forkintheroad choices you have  to make are fun and give the game tons of longevity as what choices you  make change the course of the game  The puzzles can be frustrating and  drawn out  Resident Evil  is basically Resident Evil  with none of the  bad points but missing some of the good points  The infinate ink  cartridge is definately welcome in my book  Nemesis is an incredibly scary  character  The thing that I was disappointed in was the lack of actual  story or any real characterization  There was nothing really added to the  storyline that we didnt already know  It was basically just solving  puzzles fighting Nemesis  times and the big ending  Given all this  Resident Evil  is still a fun game that will keep you on the edge of your  seat and playing well into the morning hours  Oh yeah and the bonus game  is pretty funDreamcast was a system I obtained In  as a Christmas gift I wanted a Ps and acted like any slightly spoiled child would when I opened it Ten years later I still have one and enjoyed it very much In no way am I saying that Ps didnt blow this console out of the water however ten years later I still play it My first dreamcast I did absolutely no up keep to it but sadly a hazed friend of mine belly uped my first off of a counter by snagging the controller I lazily left out Luckily I was able to replace it new for Over that ten years everything worked great on my first except for some reason Shenmue did not like to be read I believe that meant the eye was going out or my dreamcast just did not like that particular disksSome games on a disk sometimes didnt work on other dreamcasts If that happens you need to repurchase the same game and usually the other disk would work For some reasons some disks wouldnt work on some dreamcasts This wasis uncommon but it happens

My new one runs like new Every game boots right up The design IMO is attractive but dirties to easily Fan power seems a little weak but vacuuming the vents every few weeks or so really helps mine  do at own risk Its a little brick with a mediocre hardware system Its easily just as loud as an xbox  when disks are read Has a cd player option that is attractive when used alright sound put out The system utilizes its  controller slots a lot of the time to the max This is a fun party game system Roommates really helped with The use of this system Games such as DOAWetrixLe mansCrazy taxi Power stone soul caliberand many others were fun games to play with four people sometimes two right next to you
  Other multiplayers still had home multi player but also went online Games Like bomberman onlinePsOchu chu rocket were a hit online for a short period Understand that this is the first system to Fully push online play  ok people say saturn did and in fact yes their right but if anyone had played it they would probably agree with me that it was a joke If youve never played online for dreamcast lets say Compared to Ps dreamcast would make you laugh If you are younger and started next gen you may not understand why I even put up with it Understand even when I played PsO online As slow as dial up was that I put up with it because this was a first This was like Black ops of  Online play is no longer supported through Sega on dreamcast I believe if you are smart enough some people still play games like quake  online with their dreamcastsomehow
  The Next thing that is neat about the dreamcast is their games that were individually selected for that system Games such as DProject JusticeSamba de AmigoWITH MIRACHASAnd SeamanWith Mic give you huge bragging rights Samba di AmigoW Mirachas easily could fetch Some of these games are hard to find cheap or even at all With the Accessories it gets even more expensive
  Though the listed genres I put were Strong  a lot side scrollers and d fightersRpg is where it really took a hit Yes Skies of Arcadia was perfectionShenmue rockedand PsO was decent but thats about itSad
  Fps were scarce too Soldier of fortune is the only one Id really recommend now that quake  isnt online
  I love my dreamcast and play it regularly however A lot of the reason I enjoy it so much is because during my peak of gaming this is the system I had If you missed the dreamcast growing up think twice and try it before you buy Some of the happiest times were playing games like Nfl k when they came out or if a childhood friend came to visit If you jump from next gen into dreamcast without experiencing it as when it was the NEW thing your content with the console may not be as much as some reviewers will say You kind of had to experience it IMO to fully enjoy itI have a ps and a n thats all but my dc is great and i think you have to have this VMU because if you dont a lot of game you cant play i would say BUY THIS ITS GREATMaybe I just got a bad unit but my batteries ran out after only a few hours of use The memory unit runs on two type CR batteries Now the problem with this is that these batteries are so expensive that replacing them costs about  the price of the VMU Kinda expensive if you ask me It is still a great idea however and I recommend picking at least one up I have a few games for Dreamcast and they would have been somewhat less enjoyable without the unit I just hope your batteries last longer than mine didThe Dreamcast when it came out was the best system available Even today it can still hold its own against most consoles The problem that doomed the Dreamcast was timing

Usually and we see it even today consoles come out in groups  SNESGenesis PlayStationN the PSGamecubeXBox PSWiiXBox  The Dreamcast came between the PSN wave and the PSGCXBox wave Casual gamers had just shelled out money for the previous generation and the more savvy ones were saving up for the next Developers held off making Dreamcast games so when the next generation did come out the Dreamcast had a lack of titles and lessadvanced tech dooming it

That said the Dreamcast is a good console The controllers look weird but actually sit well in the hands and I like that the DC has four ports off the shelf The console is also fairly compact Plus for its lack of titles it had some really good ones the original Soul Calibur Shenmue Skies of Arcadia and Grandia II come to mindTheres no greater case for questioning why and what if than the Dreamcast Everything you can say about this system has been said x over Underrated overlooked before its time revolutionary The list goes on and on It all adds up to fun anyway

Im one of those that was completely sold on the Dreamcast Id never been more excited about a console and never have since This was the console that finally would give us arcade quality games in our homes I remember when I first saw Ready to Rumble up and running I just couldnt believe how good it looked and how fun it was to play After looking at jagged and pixelated PS games for so long it was a sight for sore eyes literally That game alone sold me on the system

I was crushed when I heard that Sega was pulling the plug and abandoning the Dreamcast The best console with the best games was on the way out and it didnt seem right It didnt make sense It was immensely popular had one of the best launches in console history and its sports games were flourishing even without EAs support It still stings the memory like your favorite team losing the championship

But we still have our memories and even better many of us still have our Dreamcasts A true testament to a console and games of the past is how well they hold up today Many times your memory serves you better than reality Ive experienced that many times with old games I used to like But many of these are still alot of fun Maybe not as much as they were at first but they can still provide a good time

Sega was in its prime when they made games for the Dreamcast Sonic Crazy Taxi House of the Dead  Sega Bass and Marine Fishing Daytona USA and Virtua Tennis are still among the best and most playable today Other honorable mentions go to Soul Calibur Street Fighter Alpha  Power Stone  Marvel vs Capcom  Jet Grind Radio  Wheeler and Silent Scope Unfortunately the dreamcast will never come back and Sega may never again be the giant that they once were but you can still find  the console the games VMUs fishing controllers and light guns to experience some of the best that gaming has to offer Get it while the gettins goodThis is a very good gaming system It was released by in September of  I think that Sega made their point out when they installed the K modem with this Its a really nice feature to have and now every modernday system comes with a ethernet or dialup modem port I didnt rate this a perfect because I think that the graphics arent that good I really dont like how the controllers are But I think that atleast they have disks because since NESN Nintendo has been using cartridges and Sega made cartridges in the beginning but they changed to disks before the Nintendo and atleast their disks are normal They have some good games like Sonic which are really good games to own Here are the technical specs of the Dreamcast

Its a really good system but I dont think you should buy it now because its WAY to oldcharges my micro just fine take it with me most the time worth getting if you have a microMy friend and I played this years ago It is the most fun I have ever had on the PC The multiplayer rocks and the graphics were great for back then

Its funny that I would review this now because my computer wont even run a game this old But if you have an older PC and it runs games you need thisSegas detractors still ask  why own a DreamcastThey also state theyre a waste of money because they failed the  bit system wars I respond by saying they are pretty inexpensive if you can find them used I recently rebought a Sega Dreamcast  controllers  games and it only cost me  I think thats a great deal The Dreamcasts graphics still impress even today Not to mention that the Dreamcasts best games are also in my opinion some of the best of all time The Dreamcasts library consists of adventure games like Sonic Adventure and Sonic Adventure  plus fighting games like Soul Calibur and Virtua Fighter  If you get tired of playing games for a while the Dreamcast will also play audio cds and features an internet connection  So even though the Dreamcast didnt survive the battle of the other  bit systems that came after it they set the bar for them and are still worth owning in my opinionThe Dreamcast was is a good system  ts only fault was arriving when it dideither too late or too early It has a sleek and quasifuturistic look The controller is a bit blocky and not as smooth as the Playstation The memory cards are huge and chunky and dont do that great of a job at least not compared to other systems But the most important element to a game system are the games Ive never been a huge fan of Sega games or their systems But one thing I noticed about the Dreamcast is that the sports games they have are generally some of the better games in their genre and are quite fun And Crazy Taxi plays well on the Dreamcast I wouldnt recommend the Dreamcast as your first or only system but since it is discontinued I guess I dont have to worry about that but if you come across one used for a reasonable deal it does make a nice system to add to the one you already have in placeIt does what its supposed to do charge a GBA Micro Quality of materials is low and the plug to the GBA Micro is a tight fit but for  I wouldnt complain too much If you need a new charger for your GBA Micro then this will get the job doneWell i now have an xbox which is grreat But i did have a DC and i have to say it was one of my fave consoles ever  great graphics it looks like Ps and it looks almost a little better than gamecube  when i heard a while back that sega was ditching dreamcast i was so mad i wondered y because it was such a great console  So i think if you are someone out there who wants to play games that areent up to date but great this is the system  I think that someday sega should jump back into the marketing and make dreamcast  with more power than ps or xbox and come with dvd and net support  It woulld be greatSonys latest console certainly has the best selection of games chief among them Pro Evolution Soccer and The Getaway It is however a tad too expensive considering its specs
The DC has an interesting game library Neither the best PS nor the worst
What it does offer is awesome quality for a low price tag The PS is capable of displaying  million polygons the same as the DC The PS has MB of VRAM while the Dreamcast has MB of VRAM
But the most astounding thing is that to this day the DC thorougly dominates two key gaming genres  racing and fighting
Metropolis Street Racing has overall better graphics than GT and handles really well Arcade racers abound such as the great Tokyo Xtreme Racer series To top it off the DC boasts the awesome F possibly the most realistic car sim ever
The DC also has what has been recognized as the best fighting game of all time  the wonderfully deep Soul Calibur Add to this countless D fighting games and other fare such as Dead or Alive  and Virtua Fighter tb and you have happy fighting game fans
Other areas that are very well covered by the DC are sports with the famed Sega Sports series and offbeat games such as Rez Space Channel  and the D version of QBert There are also a number of kids games probably more so than on the PS
The only bad thing about the DC are a few nd gen games such as Test Drive  and Rainbow Six which hold the system back somewhat And needless to be said it cannot playback your Citizen Kane DVD
Although Id take the PSs controller over the DCs the Dreamcasts joypad is certainly better than the XBoxs or that of the N
Another plus is you will find every one of the games for less than half their original price given that the DC has been discontinued
If you really want a PS XBox or GC I suggest waiting until they drop their price which they most likely will I do not think those consoles are worth that much
In short the Dreamcasts price to quality ratio cannot be beatenGame consoles are expensive these days  Im not getting an XBox because its only available in bundles at   GameCube is nice but there arnt very many good games out for it  I have a PlayStation and Game Boy Advance and recently bought a Dreamcast  Why do I always leave the things I really want to buy for last
I have so many friends that think a system with fun titles can actually die  You still play that  They stopped making them and dont make games for it anymore  Its dead its old It came out in  Uh that really wasnt that long ago  I still want an Atari  but I got a Pocket PC and a few more games at the top of my list
The Dreamcast is possibly the best console Ive had the pleasure of wasting my eyesight on  Its the first system to launch with a successful online plan  for Genesis it tried yet nobody I know knows they really DID try  That and it has some of the best games available for it Soul Reaver MDK Jet Grind Radio Crazy Taxi many more to name  In addition it has the most confortable controller Ive ever used good for big or small hands  And now that Sega is out of the hardware industry and trying to sellout their whole Dreamcast inventory the price for the Dreamcast has now dropped to   It goes necktoneck with more recent consoles and its dirtcheap
I honestly dont see any reason whatsoever why you shouldnt buy Segas final legacy  For any holiday if you have a nephew son friend or whoever that wants to play games for at least  hours a week and doesnt have one yet at  this is more than a realsteal  Most of the games now are cheap around the  range and the system costs only  times that price
In short buy the Dreamcast  Sega only stopped making them because of financial problems despite the Dreamcasts success  A lot of good games to play on it and gives the options of internet play or surfing the web or even hooking the thing up to your monitor for crisper graphics  Outstanding  Id give it a  but only if it had a builtin toasterI got my Dreamcast last Christmas and I like it alot  Its a great system  But there are two big problems  The controls for it are very awkward and they stopped production  No more games  They really could have done something with this system but once again Sega made a boobooThe following is the review of the SYSTEM not the games that can be played on it First off at first I thought that the controller would be pretty clunky due to its size But in actuality it is fairly light and fits nicely in ones hand Biggerhanded people might have a problem though What I REALLY like about the controller is that ALL buttons are accessible without having to remove your hand from ANYTHING Unlike that stupid N system that has buttons in the most unreachable places in the heat of battle I didnt see the point behind the little videogame screen on the controller though To me it just weighs it down more andlets face itwhy bother playing pixally games when you can play your Dreamcast One thing that I like about Playstation is that the memory cards are inserted into the system not the controller Wise move But unfortunately Sega didnt have the foresight to do that As for the system it is slightly smaller than a Sony Playstation Graphics run really well on this system and Im surprised at what it can do There is one thing that I have to say about the  Megs of Video RAM on Playstation PS versus the  Megs of Video RAM on Dreamcast When I watch a Final Fantasy FMV on Playstation I know that they are pushing that system TO THE ABSOLUTE LIMIT If Dreamcast has TWICE the Video RAM then I expect to see something TWICE as impressive something that is so graphically intense that it threatens to overheat the system But sadly I havent seen any Dreamcast game do that In fact some of these games look like the regular Playstation could handle them Overall this is a nicely designed system but now that Sega is putting an end to its Dreamcast games its not worth buying Id buy a Playstation Metal Gear  is around the corner and FF X or maybe a Nintendo DolphinAlthough the inside of the case was missing most of the plastic pieces that hold the disk in place the game plays great I have no loading or game play issues at all This was a great purchase and I am happy to add this game to my Tekken collectionI play games simply put  If I want to play Gran Turismo Metal Gear Solid or Final Fantasy   or  I need a PSX  If I want to play Phantasy Star I need a Sega Genesis  But in this case with the Dreamcast consoles production be halted and for a rather low price not necessarily through Amazon its quite a deal
The games that I have look very good  I have found that the Sega products tend to keep a more cartoony style while the PS is desperately trying to get the characters to look more human  Well humanoid  Only Square can do it best  I dont have many and that brings up the next case
Sega honestly doesnt have any games that I really want to play  Even when first coming out over a year ago there were few games that really caught my eye  Carrier was one of them because I thought the premise was better than the Resident Evil games which I dont care for  I needed a fighter and Streetfighter fulfills that  I have DOA on the way but the game that made me buy the DC was Phantasy Star OnLine
This review is about the Dreamcast and it IS a worthy machine no matter what anybody says about it  The problem and why it receives  stars is that the majority of games are absolute junk  I have specific tastes and Sega just doesnt quite cater  BUT thats not a bad dealHow do you know if the Dreamcast is the system for you Forget about graphics think about the games  If you love arcade style games this is the system for you  Some of the best ports include Soul Calibur Gauntlet Legends Street Fighter  rd Strike Marvel Vs Capcom Daytona USA Network Edition Mortal Kombat Gold House Of The Dead  and the list goes on  If you prefer role playing games and more adventure oriented titles even though Dreamcast does have a few good ones you may want to get Playstation  as it offers more variety in that catagory  The only bad feature about the Dreamcast is the controllersthey break down often especially if you constantly play Capcoms D fighters Plus I think it was a bad idea to make the VMU slots on the controllers rather than on the system itself it just seems awkward  As for the durability issue I cant really speak for that yet  What I can tell you is that I have had mine for well over a year now it has endured extensive play and has yet to display any noticable overheatingoveruse problems  I havent heard of any problems with the Dreamcast breaking down as of yetbut be careful  Give the vents on the right side of the Dreamcast plently of room to blow the hot air out  If you want to get a Dreamcast hurry up it probably wont be around much longer thanks to the Playstation   Fortunately the Dreamcast has already established a solid library of games  Get it now while you are still able to find games and accessories easilyI really enjoyed the Dirt series of racing games  I actually started with the Colin McRae Rally  demo which came before Dirt  Dirt  was a nice game with lots of different types of races in varied environments including Pikes Peak  You got to race semi trucks cargo trucks trophy trucks SUVs and rally cars in Dirt   The advancement was like a pyramid unlocking levels as you go I have a Toyota Tundra so it is easy to like a game that has a Toyota Tundra to race in it  Dirt  made it more radical with nice music and an attitude  The races were longer and became more XGames like I enjoyed the Baja races very much But I did not like the Microsoft Live part of it where it takes a long time to get initiated patched etc before you can actually play for the first time Once you get past this things get better The choice of vehicles were more limited but the liveries try to make up for it Dirt  keeps the same attitude and cool music but also has the same Microsoft Live treatment sign in patch  etc before the first game time  Once you get past this it does get better  At first I could not get used to the way the game downshifts automatically in the turns to automatically slow you down  I moved the difficulty up a notch to intermediate and it was much better and more of what I was expecting  I use a gamepad to play on the PC  I was pleasantly surprised that my  GTX  MB plays this game rather well at x no AA  The races are largely rally with some interesting wintertime truck races in the snow  The cars are not quite as varied as I would like  I also hate that there is ingame content that can be purchased additionally from Microsoft Live  Come on I already paid for the game and there are some levels that are pay to play so you wont really finish the season until you pony up more funds to Microsoft Live  Many of the cars are available to purchase too  That is cheesy and not appreciated  You dont need to purchase these to advance though  The gymkhana events are interesting and challenging Being a hoonigan takes practice patience and many banged up cars The Ken Block videos on youtube really inspired me to practice as I had no idea what gymkhana was before Dirt   I do miss the Baja style of offroading from Dirt   Dirt  seems to have a focus on other things but it is still fun overall For  I got my moneys worth  Maybe I will get Dirt Showdown for some demolition derby excitement or maybe notSorry Tekken fans good graphics cool characters but lacking personality Yes I know its stupid to take off one star for personalities but hey I paid for this game If you liked Tekken  without the personalities too I recommend buying this with Tekken THIS GAME WAS GREAT AS A MATTER OF FACT BUT ITS NOT ALL THAT PEOPLE SAY IT IS THERES SOME NEW CHARACTERS ADDED TO THE GAME AND THE CHARACTERS FROM THE FIRST  GAMES HAVE ALL GOTTEN OLDER THE FIGHTS ARE GREAT THE NEW AND INVENTIVE MODES SUCH AS THE ONE WHERE YOU FIGHT OFF GANGS AND STUFF LIKE THAT ON DIFFERENT STAGES ARE GOOD AND THE CHARACTERS ARE ALL FUN AND EASY TO USE TEKKEN FANS WILL LOVE THIS ONE A LOTLet me start off by saying I am not FanBoy I am not into the name brand war I am a gamer I play on any console and format PCArcadeDCPSPS Reasons to buy a DC
The console is the cheapest out of the consoles coming out
The games and the graphics for them pretty much hold there own against the PS Awesome sports lineup and online play Being realistic of course eventually the PS may surpass the DC due to the advanced harware on the PS its now up to the game makers to utilize the full potential of the PS which is probably around a  year away The PS still needs to mature before you see its true power
The console is available now While you wait for the PSXboxGamecube You can have and play a DC now with plenty of great games Plus by waiting the price of these other consoles will come down and there will be plenty of titles for them by then Good things comes to those who waitCheaper price more games more availability
Online play The best opponent is a human opponent
Bottom line Its cheap for the console and performance it provides it cant be beat Plenty of titles to choose from rd generation titles coming out soon Its available now and its got online play
Grab your DC today Gamer is OUT GAME ONTekken  is awesome New characters new moves new combos and some favorites as well Along with some great extra features aside from the tournament like Force Mode Survival and Volleyball Tekken  delivers
This is a really good game for all gamers and it hits the essence that is D fighting games Plus new characters and new fighting styles are also pretty cool The drawback is that the old button mashing is still a viable means of winning the fights and for a lot of the characters some of thier combos thats all you have to do best example Eddy Gordo For those of you advanced gamers try the new and improved King Jin and Law
Definately check out TEKKEN  This one is definitely worth it for the PSone If youre looking for other great fighting games on the PSone check out the STREET FIGHTER ALPHA series SOUL BLADE and DEAD OR ALIVE This is one kickbutt game I mean it Literally About two dozen characters multiple difficulty levels a couple of interesting games this is one supercool game
The graphics are great and the fight moves flow so prettily its almost scary The characters are all interesting to use at the very least and theres something for everyone from an enormous slowmoving bear to the lightningquick but tiny Xiou Yu
My only beef is with the Tekken Ball stage and the sidestepping Tekken Ball is just silly It does nothing for your characters its decidedly simple its    well its a little kids game stuck in the middle of a rather bloody D fighter It just doesnt seem to fit with everything else
The sidestepping is almost ludicrously difficult You have to tap the controller so lightly that taking a few simple steps to the side becomes impossible I realize that logistically it would be difficult to find another way but it does hamper your stride particularly in the Tekken Force stage
A great game thoughThis ismy favorite fighting game on my PS and I should say that I still donget bored with itThe graphics are obviously developed you could notice the polygons are smaller and the characters are more realisticAlthough there are bizarre characters such as Gon the little dinosaur they add the fun to this game even though I dont use them that muchNamco should create more of this stuffI read a lot of reviews on this game before buying it so maybe my expectations were a little high  The graphics here are really not that different in quality from XMen MA actually the backgrounds in XMen are more dynamic  The fighting is good here though and the characters really do have distinct fighting styles that give you quite the challenge in Arcade mode They also tend to defend themselves more here so your every kick or punch wont connect like you want it to  If youre buying for a good fighting game then you shouldnt be disappointedbut if youre buying expecting graphics that are unlike anything youve ever seen before you may beGauntlet Legends is a mindless hack slash burn and blast game There is nothing wrong with aimlessly wandering about creepy dungeons mashing buttons and mowing down bad guys Its especially fun with companions This game is a classic I enjoy the graphics the audio effects the characters the different environments and seemingly endless procession of monsters in this game Finding all the switches one needs to progress is sometimes tiresome The games storyline is linear but thats okay Sometimes a formulaic approach is just what the doctor orderedGraphics 
Very impressive with smooth animations and the requisite cool lightning effects
Sound 
While theres no Street Fighterstyle semiincoherent yells the sound effects are better than what you see in most fighters and the music isnt too annoying either
Gameplay 
If youre new to fighting games this is a good place to start with lots of easy combo strings and flashy moves with enough depth to justify spending a week or two learning the ins and outs of your favorite character Unfortunately hardcore fans will be disappointed with the emphasis on uncounterable pokes double reversals and insane float combos
Replay 
Lots of new actually interesting modes and plenty of characters for you to trash a friend with Its just plain fun playing as a giant bear or breakdancing fighter
Overall  not an average
If youre reading this review you probably dont care about the finer gameplay aspects Go ahead and buy it even novices can have lots of fun If youre experienced with D fighters youll probably want to buy a Dreamcast insteadThis game is great The handling is cool and so is the combat and magic combat I personally would reccomend this game for Legend lovers  ya know magic The buttons are great and so are the graphicsThe Tekken catagory of games D style came about on its own and took the gaming world by storm Tekken  is just another step up the ladder of success for the Tekken series This game has Tekken Ball where you play volleyball it has numerous hidden characters and it will definitely keep you playing for hours so you can see your move over and over again in instant replayThe Dreamcast is the next generation of gaming machine from Sega most well known for its Sonic the Hedgehog games With Dreamcast Sega moves beyond Sonic into a heavily graphic and netsavvy arcade machine
Probably the biggest difference between the Dreamcast and its competitors is the built in k modem This allows Dreamcast owners to log on to the net surf the web and fight other opponents head to head This opens up a HUGE opportunity for finding playmates that until now was restricted to computer gamers The web surfing ability only sweetens the deal although like WebTV there is no ability to download
Its not for free    but for a household that is currently not on the Internet the price gets both the web access and unlimited gameplay You also need to buy a keyboard if you wish to do any web work
Like the Sony Playstation the Dreamcast will play audio CDs Unlike the Playstation  it will not play DVDs however Also while the Playstation  can play all Playstation games since both are CD based the Sega Dreamcast cannot play older Sega games
Popular Sega games tend to be arcade or fighting games  Rayman  Street Fighter Alpha  The incredibly high polygon draw rate three million polygons per second means that these games fly giving great gameplay
Even though this is equipped with a x CD player its still slower than a cartridge system like the N On the upside CDs are cheaper than cartridges and can hold a lot more information on them leading to more involved games
Im personally not a huge Dreamcast fan  the types of games available on it arent ones that tend to appeal to me  but my arcade and fighting loving friends enjoy it a great deal
Specifications CPU bit RISC Clock Speed  MHz  Sound CD quality  voices Connector standard plug videoaudio connector  x  resolutionThe case doesnt hold disc one in place but the game discs and manual are in good conditionI can  say the game was great and it surprised me that it was still functioning  I was usually expecting it to not work  though Ill have to wait and see  One of the good but unknown games in the s  Can recommend this to people with old systems though I cant offer any guarantees since who is using an old Playstation nowadaysGreat game but really hard and takes a long time to develop your skills etc  Very innovative for its time though creating you own armor weapons and even food  Also many characters to choose from given your decisions  Its a bit old now so given everything not many people would play it through  I believe I got to the last boss once but got demolished so gave up and deleted my file  That was some years ago  I have the PS version too  Think I had the same issue but actually did better  For some reason the last bosses in these games just pulverize you  Give Rotney anotha chance LOL Jackie the Joke Man from Howard Stern referenceThe storyline characters and music are all incredibly good I could play this for hours and not get bored

Only con is Some stuff is so frickin cryptic You have to look at a guide or you will miss many things while playing I spend half my time playing with my head in a guideAll gamers have had the experence of playing a game be it an RPG or anything else they felt had its fair share of flaws but has that one very bright redeeming quality that makes all those flaws take a backseat to that one positive

Star Ocean The Second Story is one of those games Star Oceans appeal at least in my case can be summed up in a single word combat Star Oceans combat system is probably the games most notable feature The realtime battle system which has a very arcadelike feel to it is a very enjoyable change than your standardfair RPG battles Its just so much fun to destory enemies with a volley a special attacks from you and your allies The skill system is also a plus as well increasing characters stats and developing other usefull non combat skills

Unfortunately the rest of Star Oceans elements arent quite up to par when compared to the hustle and bustle of battle Graphically Star Ocean is behind the times no matter where you turn excluding the FMVs Actually the games graphic engine is very simular to a  SquareEnix title the often overlooked and bashedtonoend SaGa Frontier one of my favorites  yes Im serious The fact the game uses most of the same graphical tricks empolyed by a game two years earlier underlines this fact

Storywise Star Ocean  suffers another slightly smaller blow While the story is generally good it seems to drag on until you reach the second disc where you do more exploring and fighting and the story begins to unfold more Characters arent as developed as well in Star Ocean compared to other RPGs such as Final Fantasy or Wild Arms though the game tries to make a very obvious effort to do this though the use of the private actions system where you enter a location and your characters split up and you can talk to them on a oneonone basis to discover more about them  this affects the outcome of the game in various ways I will give the developers credit for trying though

Musically Star Ocean  has its ups and downs Some of the tunes can be quite annoying but no game score is without its duds However when you hear the battle themes played near the end of the game for the final bosses which mainly are of heavy rockmetal variety all is foregiven Soundwise the characters various soundbites during battle are cute at first but become annoying really quickly how many times can you remember Claude saying thats around  points after a battle  too many to admit when Im sober

Even with its flaws Star Ocean The Second Story is an above average RPG While Im not sure if I would call it a classic  I would recommend it to anyone who had the time or showed interest in the genreIve been an RPG fan for longer than I can remember and have played around  of em
Despite the VERY harsh review of gamecriticscom I thought this game was actually really good A nice breath of fresh air from the very linear but nonetheless brilliant Final Fantasy games
Hell sure the story wasnt to die forbut beautiful musicacool combat system and tons of replay value make this one that every fan of the genre should ownI must saythis game is alot of fun there are many many many endings so replay value is great I thought I would hate it I dont care much for the sprite type char but after playing for just a hour  making your own weapons food goods well it was a blast I would buy this  an well I have Virtua Fighter may have a hard time competing with games such as DOA or tekken tag but believe me this was what paved the way for those games  All though it lacks where the others seem to excell with story modes and hidden characters virtua fighter makes up with character variety and a great display of styles drunken style mantis sumo etc  I was shocked at how fun this game was even after playing more modern games  Even with new games on the market I think ill be playing this one for a while  The teacher of fighting gamesWords cannot describe
You need to feel this game Cringe as Pai floors  you with a double toe kick and mercilessly follows up with a jumping knee  to the midriff Cheer as you fight back with a spinning kick as you get up  You nimbly dodge the next kick and fire off a triple punch combo finishing  with a powerful backhanded punch to win the round Watch it on the replay  go on Laugh at Shuns everincreasing drunkenness Memorise that sweep  kick movement Gape as you realise fighting games do not have to feature  blazing blue fireballs and Super Hyper Alpha Combo Breaking Double EX  Special Level Three moves Instead heres a fighting game where the  feature is actual fighting Crikey
So why only 
Get to about  oooh Level  Battle relentlessly until both characters are nearing the  end of their tether Open your attack and watch as the opposition stops it  and fires one back knocking you out Pound your controller through the  floor while screaming BUTIPUSHEDPUNCHTHEN
Recover from  that bout of frustration continue the game and realise that when youre  not frustrated youre having incredible fun Read this review Go to the  store Buy the game Do it nowThe dream cast equipment was much better than the knockoffs  There are fewer problems and it lasts foever I purchased a madcats version in  and it died after only about a year The Dreamcast FControler I purchased new in  is still going strong todayThis game brought back memories I was excited to get it but it took awhile about a week and a half but it still came and when it did I was so happy It was worth it And the disc was in good condition Great for nostalgic peopleThis is a must own for Dreamcast owners and Sonic fans  There are six major campaigns Sonic Tails Knuckles Amy Big the Cat and Gamma  Each have their own style of gameplay and each campaign adds to the story  When you beat al six campaigns a seventh and final campaign allows you to play as Super Sonic to conclude the story

Now there are a few flaws  Sometimes the control in the game is pretty bad and the camera doesnt always go where you want it to go  My least favorite campaign is Big the Cats because it focuses less on action and focuses on fishing

But its still a fun game and I can still play itI never actually played the original Sonic Adventure until I was in my midlate teens this game came out when I was  or  I grew up on SADX on the gamecube The game is almost exactly the same but the different more vivid textures make it seem like a more realistic environment while also giving it a sense of older fashionsense days

Ill skip the gameplay since its a very basic Sonic gameplay most people in the midSonic times are familiar with Ill definitely say its a bit more slippery and bouncy though but that was probably to show off the major advantage the DreamCast had over the original PlayStation or the N

The chao garden in this game is easily the most far removed from the other  versions in SA SAB and SADX The others have cute snuggly happy chao whose lives are only miserable if your torture them You know what youre doing with your chao and accidents are rare Not the case in this game Every chao is born as an adult and will very quickly kill itself if you dont do something soon Their movements like most of the game are very bouncy I dare say this is the bounciest thing in any majorrelease game Ive ever seen actually Its almost a highspeed environment with a visible difficulty level

If youre looking for a sentimental chao garden this better be your last buy If youre only after something nostalgic or want to collect for SEGA fandoms sake this is one you absolutely cant leave out

Id also like to mention that when this game was released I didnt know about it until about  years later At the time I was into Sonic and Pokemon when Kanto was the only region for the most part and I thought the new art style was as cool as anything could ever be I didnt recognize Knuckles though because Id only ever seen AoStH and a few Sonic products in stores such as spaghettios I literally thought Knuckles was an enhancedawesomeness version of Tails since he was the only character on the can with Sonic I completely forgot about that feeling until this showed up in the mail after I ordered it The box art is just so much more detailed than any other Sonic games that I can think of regarding resolution at least

If youre just breezing through and want a Sonic game with good music or gameplay this wont be close to the bottom of your list but not the top either This is a casual buy if youre not collecting or shooting for nostalgiaI really like this product It has a good looking And also it has a pretty good size I really like this productSonic Adventure is one of the most important games of Sonics History being it was the first D Sonic the Hedgehog game
If you recall on the Sega Saturn
Sonic Xtreme was going to be D but it was cancelled
Sonic D Blast was isometric not D
Sonic R was D but it was a racing game
Sonic World was D but it was in Sonic Jam
Sonic Jame was a compilation of the first  sonic games

The Hub Worlds are amazing and so are the action fields
It makes sense to have you complete all the stories to get the final story It was repeated for a few until  We ALL know what happened then
The Camera oh God the camera I have SO MANY TIMES due to the camera which is why my rating is  starsSonic Adventure took Sonic to an amazing level and it only took  years of Sega Saturn failures The first thing Sonic does is fight a monster called Chaos After beating Chaos the camera turns to Eggman who ominously tells himself Sonic has no idea what he is up against the perfect start to the game Sonic then goes off to rescue Tails from a plane crash starting the first level Emerald Coast was a beautifully rendered beach with a beautiful theme and HUGE D ACTION The camera shifts and Sonic is suddenly is being chased by a giant whale After that he runs through a tight cave and then finally rescues Tails After a happy reunion Eggman steals Tails Chaos Emerald and feeds it to Chaos the monster Congratulations you can now play as Tails He can fly His levels involve racing Sonic and Eggman Just like in Sonic R and thats about it The best thing about Tails was his inspirational motto I want to fly high I shall belive in myself After Tails was Knuckles who had a totally different story One night he was rethinking his life and why exactly he was guarding the Master Emerald when somebody steals the Master Emerald way to go Knucklehead His levels are composed of finding the Master Emerald pieces Knuckles wasnt nearly as good as Tails After Knuckles comes Amy Rose Sonics girlfriend Her levels focused on platforming while avoiding a robot that decided to chase her Maybe a  year old girl would find Amy and her obnoxious theme song cool but the teenage nerd reviewing this finds Amy very annoying Big was next and Sega really should avoided this idea while in development Big is a BIG cat according to the Sonic Team He really looked like a purple bunnybear creature His whole goal was to find his pet frog Froggy what a clever name It was torture watching him trudge to some water in the great zones Sonic and Tails enjoyed Twinkle Park was only a lake for Big For Sonic it was a bumper car ride followed by intense platforming and the great voices Sonic Tails Amy E Gamma and Eggman made Big even worse In a dumb voice Big constantly shouts FROGGY WHERE ARE YA
Thankfully E Gamma came after Big Gamma is a robot built by Eggman You start out following Eggmans orders Shoot the Sonic Doll shoot the real Sonic lock Amy in jail After that Gamma accidently sees Eggman torturing his robot rival Beta and starts to wonder if he should follow Eggmans rules Like every good robot character Gamma decides to betray Eggman and find his true destiny

Update  Okay I am almost through with this game and feel like throwing up The end is VERY intense with the Final Egg level almost being impossible due to collision issues and camera bugs but I got through it Chaos actually succeeds and completely destroys the city which is only made worse by the Dreamcast  Gamecubes jawdropping graphics and the song that plays Open Your Heart really makes me sick AwesomeSonic Adventure was the start of Sonics Modern appearence its an excellent game and the storyline will send shivers of joy down your back it was also the first game to allow you to raise Chao its really cool also try the sequel sonic Adventure  its got an even better storyline and is the first appearence of Shadow the Hedgehog and Rouge the batSonic Adventure
When the Dreamcast first came out this was one of the games you had to have Sonic being the cornerstone of Sega was expected to be Segasnbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefSuperMariodpBFGMrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTFSuper Mario a Although it failed to meet that expectation they did create a fairly fun game I still think if you own a Dreamcast that this needs to be in your collection If you dont own a Dreamcast there is no reason to find one just for this game

Graphics 
At the time these were really good graphics They couldnt stand up tonbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefSoulCaliburdpBKrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTFSoul Calibura but it was still solid Many problems lie within the graphics though The level design is poor The Adventure Zones are small and yet have a loading screen every time you walk through a door Action Zones are sometimes better like in Twinkle Park but not usually The camera has all kinds of problems You will become annoyed very quickly if you find yourself in a small room and the camera is caught The graphics are smooth and have some good details but overall the level design is just ugly

Story 
This is probably the best aspect of the game In this game you dont just play as Sonic you can play as five other characters Tails Amy Knuckles E and Big You cant just pick whoever you want you have to start as Sonic and earn other characters One you earn another character you can go play through their stories You earn other characters by meeting them in the game So the stories sort of intertwine You never wonder what other characters were doing because you can play as them all and figure out Other than that the story is you basic Sonic story Dr Robotnik is causes havoc and you have to stop him Its just interesting because it shows how the story affects all the characters in the game

Sound 
Your basic Sonic sounds You have some decent music here and there and that stupid jump noise A lot of music is reused over and over again The sound in this game is just above average and has nothing special about it

Gameplay 
Although they added in the ability to play as different characters this is still a very bad gameplay wise game As Sonic you go through the longest portions of the game Sonics story is probably one of the most interesting and well worth your time Tails consists of you racing Sonic to try to prove that you are just as good as him This is fairly fun but you are practically just replaying a portion of Sonics game As Amy you will be protecting a bird You have a hammer as a weapon which is at least a little interesting As Big you have to fish to find your friend Froggy This is a change in pace but it is poorly done and very annoying trying to catch that stupid frog Knuckles can glide and climb on things As Knuckles you are looking for pieces of crystals This is fun but far too easy As E you are working for Robotnik for most of the game but you also get to play the aftermath He has probably the easiest game in the entire game as he uses a gun

Difficulty  Note This is how much I like the difficulty
The game is either extremely easy or it is annoying like Bigs is The game can be flown through The only thing that keeps the length up is the multiple characters Even with all the characters this game can easily be beat within  days I know the game is based for a younger audience but it could offer a little challenge The only hard part in the entire game is the final th character you unlock

Overall 
This game is a fun game worth playing it just fails at being a truly entertaining experience If you own a Dreamcast I suggest you buy this game If you dont own a Dreamcast forget you even read this review and go buy something awesomeSonic Adventure is an instant Dreamcast classic that shouldnt be missed by any Dreamcast owner  The game features Sonic in full d with newly detailed level enviroment  This was one of the first games to launch with the Dreamcast and is still one of my favorite Dreamcast game  The game features a brand new system called the Chao system you basicly take care of them and show them new moves its very simple but youll need to have a VMU card to do it  The game features more then  playable characters  The story in the game is very lame if you ask me they could have done better not to mention the english dubbing is terrible so just stick to japanes language and english subtitles

Ill make this short and sweet for you  Sonic Adventure is the best sonic game ever and has great levels awesome d levels and lots of things to do but personally I wanted to beat the storyline instead of that whole chaos thing  Im going to make this review short and sweet

Good

Great Level desighn

awesome d graphics of Sonic for the Dreamcast

Lots of playable characters which is really great

the new Chaos growing process but I really didnt do it I just play the storyline

Superb fast pace action

Bad

horrindess english dubbing

the cutscenes look horrible even the ingameplay is better then the cutscenes

Some really bad camera angles ruin the fast pace of this game

I kind of wished it was a SONIC ONLY adventurebut ohwell

The ugly

Robotnickehehheh

Overall Sonic Adventure for the Dreamcast is an instant classic packed with full d enviroment and Full d character model and fast paced action with some really great music  Some things like camera angles ruin this game and some really bad english dubbing makes it even worse  But overall this game doesnt dissapoint Sonic fans and that is why Im giving it a

 out 

This is still in my opinion the best Sonic Game ever but it was ruined by some flawsGreat game overall though

LatesNice speed and gameplay overall  The only  cons are the camera angles and some of the enviroments arent fully interactive  You cant enter all the buildings with each character  Even with that though its a great game and some levels are extremely well matched with the background music red hot mountain I played this game for nearly three hours before realizing how long Id been on it  Deffinetly worth the time and money to pick this one upThis Is Eaiser Than the first one but its pretty fun i liked it You get to play some original characters like Bad Mister Frosty Taffy The Blob  Bonker IckybodclayMy Favorite

If You liked this game then check out Clayfigter C Judgement clay Clay Fighter Extreme Clayfighter   Sculptors Cut Clay Fighter Tournament EditionIm not a big fan of the DiabloDD typr game but this game is really neat The one big advantage of this game over Diablo is the ability to control  characters in one game Very high replay value also makes this game a winner Pick up a copy if you can Ive seen it rather inexpensive at local retail store For the price you cant go wrongNow that Ive gone back and started replaying Diablo I realize how spoiled Ive become playing Darkstone Major improvements were made the the Diablo engine by GOD when they put this game out and Diablo actually feels somewhat kludgy in comparison Ability to change camera angle the Previously Visited Places menu that sort of thing GODTake  did a good job with the patches as well not only fixing some DD problems in the original version but adding playability as well A fine product overall thats still got me banging away at monsters after months of singleminded playingIts interesting to note now that Diablo II has come out how many of the improvements Darkstone incorporated into the Diablo play model are now found in Diablo II Darkstone has a previously visited  locations menu that allows you to reduce the tedium of having to  navigate a lot of area youve cleaned out already Diablo II has  waypoints Darkstone had extra skills which you could customize  classes with as does Diablo II Darkstone had a populated wilderness area  as does Diablo II
Darkstone gives you two characters one of which will  contribute to battles when youre controlling the other it can be a fun  game for a younger child who wouldnt be able to play Diablo Even if he  cant click fast enough to kill the monsters hell have backup Also the  shops use pictures of items which means a child who cant read or is just  learning can still play if he knows his numbers The game generally seems  less spooky and bloody
With all due respect to T Byrl the voice  acting is a bit strained though not the worst weve heard
The quests  pile up a lot more quickly than in Diablo as well Its difficult to get  through the first two villages without being accosted by halfadozen  villagers needing tasks performed That keeps things moving  along
Overall the game seems a lot easier than Diablo Spells cost  less gold is more plentiful magical items easier to come by resurrection  spells allow one surviving character to bring bacak one that just died  etc etc etc And you have to worry less about moving in combat rather  than attacking as would happen in Diablo quite a bit
But the combats a  bit mushy relative to Diabloa little too automatic feeling perhaps  which is the only thing that keeps me from giving it the five stars I  killed the first boss losing one of my own characters before  I knew what happened But then I could just resurrect him
Overall a  worthwhile contribution to the genreNot perfect by any means but it has addicted me Graphics are OK Voiceovers are not the kind Blizzard has made us come to expect Not the best story But I am enjoying it and for thirty bucks that says a lot
True they also wont win any points for originality all though there  are a number of game play innovations that I hope the staff at Diablo II  wont ignoreupgrading weapons skills better mapping running and that  feature that autopilots you to certain places youve been before Single  player was fun featuring the ability to use two characters but as with  almost games I play nowadays multiplayer is what I care about And with  two good friends We had quite a blast romping through the dungeons at  Heatnet all though its difficult to get a game going there as it hasnt  achieved a high level of popularity What made it even better was that the  three of us were using Roger Wilco to communicate It felt like we were in  our High school Dungeons and Dragons days even though we were in different  states
Well until Diablo II comes out as many have said you could do a  lot worse than this gameWhen it came out this game was HUGELY anticipated After all the Sonic the Hedgehog series is one of the most popular in videogame history Was it worth the wait Was it worth the hype Is it worth picking up even now
The transition from D to D has been much discussed in the past and you can see why What works great in D doesnt always translate so well into the D world And when a series makes this sometimes awkward transition there are usually a few hiccups
Sonic Adventure attempts to use level design that gives you the speed of the original games while also featuring puzzle solving and rpgadventure elements talk to people play minigames open doors ect By featuring several different characters for you to play as the game allows you to play a balanced game sonic blast through stages with nothing slowing you down tails run away like a chicken amy shoot everythign in sight the robot go on a treasure hunt knuckles or spend all your time fishing big the cat Each of these elements is entertaining in its own right but where the game really shines is the action scenes as sonic and tails The adventure portion of this game suffers from the same flaw as many rpgs namely you cant find the stupid key to open the door So the first time through you may hit a few snags And the some of the more adventureplatformer elements can get VERY frustrating I hate the platforming section of the snow level and the skydeck level in particular And of course the collision detection polygon clipping and camera problems are pretty darn buggy
Still youve got to love this game The graphics are great some of the levels the first level windy valley and speed highway especially are just plain awesome Everyone should at the very least play this game and true videogames fans should own it It has flaws that cant be ignored but there are enough moments of greatness how about the part in the temple where you see the stone carving of chaos destroying the world to more than make up for it Definitely check it outWhoa I have never seen such a fastpaced game like this one After playing the demo on the Sega Dreamcast generator disk I decided to try to find this and after playing for about  hours I was definently satisfied with it Being a long time fan of Sonic Sonic the Hedgehog   and  Sonic and Knuckles Sonic D Blast I was looking forward to this Dreamcast title The graphics are absolutely amazing the music is great and the action is fast furious and entertaining However I have to deduct a star for the occasional camera angle which somtimes interfered with gameplay Besides that this game is a keeper for all Dreamcast owners Get this along with its awesome sequel Sonic Adventure  ASAPSonic Adventure starts off easily and its easy to get the hang of  However it may be a little too easy  There is a lack of puzzles and the bosses are pretty simple  I guess Im the person that likes RPGs like Zelda and Grandia II  The story is hohum but once you get into it the story really breaks off in different directions when you see the game through the eyes of the six characters you can play with  Thats the main reason I gave it four stars instead of two  Also the graphics and sound are good  My only gripe about the sound is when characters are talking their mouths speak Japanese but they speak in English  That is if you have the language set on English  Im not sure of this but I AM sure that their oral movements definately arent matching what they say  Overall its worth the priceIn this game you play Sonic the Hedgehog attempting to Chaos the watery God of Destruction from annihilating the world  Later in the game five additional characters are introduced into the game  each with their own style of play
There are basically two types of levels in Sonic  In action stages the game behaves like any other platform game Mario Adventure Pandemonium Crash Bandicoot where you run around a D world along a predefined path dodging traps destroying enemies and collection objects  In adventure stages your character is allowed to free form explore  talking to characters and finding hidden objects
There are also a couple of mini games including a chao breeding simulation which provide additional amusement
The graphics are beautiful to look at and the level design is extensive and complex  The sound effects and sound track are also very well executed although there is no attempt to lipsynch the voiceovers  Overall the game is fun and has a lot of replay valueThis game COULD have been a classic but it isnt The game has been developed under a very strict deadline and because of this youll often get the feeling that things shouldve been tweaked a bit Dont get me wrong it still has got plenty of things in it to justify the purchase but its a darn shame that they didnt wait lets say a month with the release
Ive got almost no complaints about the graphics Theyre very good and move very fast The camera doesnt always cooperate though and that can sometimes be very annoying It also seems that Tails hovers a bit over the landscape so he doesnt let himself be controled fluently
The difficultylevel of the Sonic and Tails campaign is okay although sometimes its a little too easy I didnt find the Knucklescampaign quite entertaining In each level youll have to find  emeralds adventurestyle This isnt fun because the sonicgames are fun because theyre fast and pretty much straightforward With knuckles youll sometime be looking for an emerald for five minutes The robotcampaign is far too easy but has a very original and even moving storyline Youll have to find out for yourself
The leveldesign varies from pretty good snowlevel to simply amazing amusementparklevel
Overall its a pretty good game that couldve been better It doesnt cost all that much thoughI have been a fan of the whole of the Clay Fighter series and i have to say that i am slightly disappointed with this one  The graphics are okay there are plenty of characters to choose from but i think that it is far to easy and that the game had been rushed  The price is excellent and i recommend to everyone that you get this as the price of this game wont be around for long  If you want the best fighting game on the N then i wouldnt recommend this but if you want some fun then this is the game for youDescent  is Interplays followup to the highly acclaimed Descent franchise  You are once again cast in the role of the Material Defender  This time however your mission is one of retribution as you battle  virallyinfected robots across  levels  normal plus  secret You  must prove that the head of the PTMC intentionally contaminated the  companys robots with an alien virus  After your rescue in the stunning  opening cutscene you learn that the PTMC went so far to modify the virus as  well
You will fly a total of three ships in this sequel including the  old PyroGL  Weapons run the gamut from the standard concussion missile to  the allpowerful Black Shark  New energy weapons such as the Microwave  Cannon add a new twist to decimating enemies and standbys such as the  Fusion Cannon and Plasma Cannon make a return The graphics are  breathtaking and the sound is nothing short of immersive
Descent   requires a MHz Pentium processor with a MB D accelerator card that  supports DirectD Glide or OpenGL  I recommend a Pentium II or III class  machine to get the most enjoyment out the game  Certain details can be  turned off to get an acceptible framerate on lowerend machines but it  detracts from the overall experience
If youre a Descent fan or a newbie  Descent  is a nice to get acquainted with the wonderful world of PC  gamingIf you expect Sonic Adventure is just going to be another one of those typical Sonic games  think again Sonic Adventure is  loads of fun essential for your Dreamcast collection Who can own a Sega system without a Sonic game I think that is a huge accomplishment for Sega because its really hard to find a game out there with a good story line that is appropriate for anyone The graphics are great Unfortunately you will probably be paying more attention to the realistic scenery than beating the game Sonic Adventure is rediculously easy I beat it in  days Im  years old However my  year old cousin spent a lot more time on it it took her about  weeks or so It basically depends on your problem solving skills and things like that Oh  did I mention the camera problem This one hurts Throughout the game the camera is a MAJOR obstacle You are CONSTANLY hidden behind some rock pillar or even the scenery Sometimes this can give you a bit of a headache the camera is so bad it makes you dizzy
Overall I give this game  stars  it would have been  if there wasnt that stupid camera problem Also I recommend this game for all ages especially ages around SOnic is back and is looking like he never has before This game is very fun and addictive It has awesome graphics and has tons of levels The only bad thing I can think of about this game is it is a little to easy You can unlock up to six characterseach with their own adventure You can play minigames and replay previous levels This is a great game and no one should miss out on it The short version Graphics  Sound  Control  Fun Factor  Total This is a Sonic game in D that about sums it up Everything you would expect from a traditional Sonic game is here  Fast paced gameplay great graphics a memorable soundtrack all of the holes to fall in and glitches also If you go too fast you will often find yourself getting stuck in a wall or falling through the scenery The camera also seems to have a hard time keeping up with the action The stages of the game are standard Sonic including an ice level a casino level a green hilltype level ect  Though many of the features in Sonic Adventure are just revisions of older ideas there are also some new additions that keep the game fresh Plenty of minigames and multiple characters give the game replay value Despite the minor drawbacks Sonic Adventure is one game for the Dreamcast that should not be missedI liked this game alot its challenging and it took me awhile to beat longer than most other games I do recommend buying the strategy guide because its easy to miss alot Anyways if you like the original Myst youll love this Great graphics only flaws was there was a glitch here and there but nothing majorTheres weird hybrids and then theres The Misadventures of Tron Bonne which might best be described as a combination of singleplayer Mario Party with the inventorty and character  interaction of a Final Fantasy game  But that description  misses two important factors wanton plunder and CUTE LITTLE  SERVBOTS
The goal of the game is to collect onemillion zenny a Capcom  monetary unit to pay off the Bonne family debts  The young  morallyunencumbered Tron is a mechanical whiz so she sets off in the  mighty ship Gesselschaff with its robotic crew to raise the funds the  oldfashioned way by stealing them
The four major modes in the title  are minigames two variants on dungeoncrawling a puzzle section and a  D platform shootout  Tron usually piloting her mechanical mobile suit  Gustaff is assisted by  cuteasabutton servbots  The  great thing about the servbots is their absolute innocence in the service  of piracy  its hilarious to blow the doors off a house send in the  servbots and watch them run out yelling yay their arms full  of loot
The servbots have distinct personalities and unique skills that  can be unlocked by giving each a unique object  They can also improve  their core skills by playing still more minigames aboard the ship  And  for servbots that get lazy theres a torture room where youre challenged  to spike torch and flatten naughty servbots
Its a peculiar mix but  openminded gamers will love this titleThis is one of the most fun RTS I have ever played You get to slap around your minions torture the good guys and pretty much have a blast being evil The bile demons are great and the dark mistresses laughs are creepy This has a very good sense of dark humor and I would not recommend it to anyone under  or anyone who didnt like dark humor

We got Evil Genius because we heard it was made by the same people Evil Genius does NOT hold a candle to this I still play it a hell of a lot and I still have fun with it

The only problems I have is the fact that it tends to have problems with the videos on my computer pretty much not playing them And the fact you cannot get multiplayer to work If the multiplayer worked there would be no question about giving this game  starsThe Playstation version of Riven is definantly not as good as the PC version but it still adds up to be a great experience Solid gameplay crips graphics and topnotch sound But still falls short in some areas Disc changing can get very tedious Thats one reason why I recommend the DVD version for the pc But its no doubt this game will suck you in and keep you sucked for a long time Get ready to experience a whole new worldDungeon Keeper  is a great game The plot is that you build a dungeon to attract creatures to fight heroes to get portal gems to give to the Horned Reaper who collects them to get to go to the Overworld our world Sadly this never happens because number  was canceled but the game is a hidden jewel

  You can build all of the normal dungeonesque rooms eg prisons gladiator pits and torture chambers You can recruit many creatures from the usual demons and undead to the odd imps and goblins The reason I rated the game  overall is because of the incompatibility between DK and XP The game works on my XP for about an hour then it crashes or freezes The patches also wont work because some goon deleted patch  to  which is what you need to get the rest all the way to  Confusing eh If you think you can have fun for an hour or get it to work then I strongly suggest you try the game You wont be disappointedI really liked this game  I played pen  pencil Dungeons  Dragons for years so I have an appreciation of the dungeonmaster concept behind this game  Dungeon Keeper  is a blend of realtime strategy basebuilding and simdeveloping but the real treat is being able to play as naughty as you wantand be rewarded for it  There are a few things that I would change about DK but overall I found it quite enjoyable even years after its initial release

Gameplay There are three different gameplay modes  First there is the campaign which includes several mission in which you snuff out the lairs of heroes and rival keepers on your way to dominating the region  Typically you build a base by tunneling out rooms and finding gold attract a legion of monster henchmen while doing so and then take on the forces of your rival  There is enough variation in the missions to prevent boredom although there are a few very tough missions especially the last two  There is also a skirmish mode that lets you fight against  rival keepers while fighting off other interlopers The skirmish game can be customized in various ways although there are only about  maps  Finally there is a my pet dungeon mode for those who just want to build their subterranean masterpieces without being troubled by opposition although you can choose to include setpiece battles against heroes All of the gameplay modes have their appeal though I liked the campaign and skirmish the best  The game can be played online but I suspect there is not much of a multiplayer community these days

The game is fairly easy to play once you master the controls  Youll need certain rooms in place lair hatchery blacksmith prison torture chamber and library to really get things going along with a number of choice spells heal rally make gold that can be researched at the library  You have limited control of your creatures beyond being able to drag and drop them  You can take direct control over a creature with the possession spell and even have a number of creatures follow you  This puts the game into firstperson perspective which can be fun but not all that useful in later stages of the campaign But again the real joy of the game is all of the naughty things that you can do like torture captured heroes in your custombuilt torture chamber have corpses drug to your graveyard where they might eventually attract a vampire to do your bidding or summon the godlike Horny Devil to turn the tide of a battle  A fully fleshedout dungeon feels almost like a small town under your control and you can spend hours just admiring and tinkering with your handy work or trying to keep your minions happy  And though a somewhat dark game DK has more than its share of humor from the Vincent Pricelike narrator to the casino that gives you a ridiculously funny treat if one of your monsters hits the jackpot  The game never comes across as cheesy or trivial but it obviously does not take itself too serious

Graphics For a game that came out in the late s DK looks pretty good  Models are detailed enough to be credible representations of various monsters and animations are pretty decent  Some models such as the enemy hero lords are used too often but otherwise the visuals are good enough to allow the game to immerse you

Sounds The game does have enough sound effects to convince you that it takes place in an underground dungeon  However the best sounds are the voice acting which is topknotch all the way around  The narrator is both sinister and hilarious and the enemy heroes are overthetop in their arrogant dismissive attitudes toward evil  The music is okay but not particularly gripping

Technical Issues The game has been quite stable on my system even though I have XP with service pack  Be sure to install the latest game patch before playing

ReplayabilityValue I picked this game up new for about  on eBay so I certainly got my moneys worth I dont see much replay value in the campaign though I can imagine replaying it again at least once  The skirmish mode is decent and there are enough maps to keep you playing for a while  If you are looking to play online Im afraid youll have a hard time finding a game

Pros
great concept for a game
terrific voice acting
a few different gameplay modes
the dark humor is spot on
its good to be bad

Cons
no online community at this point
a few frustrating campaign missions
no modding community to speak ofOn a scale of  the graphics in this game are a  As for the AI its a they cant figure out how to go around any obstacles There are only  missionsI beat the entire game in  nights Its a lot of fun though There  is a tradeoff between fun and frustrating You will probably play this game  for a long time and i reccomend getting itMechwarrior  is the sequel to the classic mechwarrior  which made me stay up almost every night Now I must say the graphics are beautiful The lighting effects are shown well on my Creative Labs Savage Gameplay is  pretty impressive too I use a gravis blackhawk For keyboard users you do  get a foldout leaflet with all the keys pretty intimidating at first The  biggest problem with this game is its length and difficulty The missions  finish way to fast and are way too easy I beat most of the missions on the  first try I also finished the game in less than a week But you  multiplaying on any of those networks Ill probably buy the expansion I  hope its good There arnt many new mechs too so another disappointment  there All in all this is a good game but to fully get its value you  have to play against other peopleThis game is a hoot Taking the originals overthetop Evil to a new level in graphics and a far improved firstperson engine it basically polishes and refines the gameplay of DK
You control a variety of  minions from Goblins to Dark Angels with a variety of wants and needs  all toward the larger purpose of wiping out the good in the world And a  simpering pompous sort of good it is full of bloated speech and poseurs  who care at least as much about how good they look as they do about  fighting evil
Much like Bullfrogs Populous The Beginning however  there isnt a lot of game here Its more of a puzzle game than a realtime  strategy game and once you solve the puzzle actually enacting it is  usually pretty straightforward Like PTB the beginning levels are easily  won by accident making this a good game for children if you dont mind the  suggestive content Actually all there is is that the Pain  Mistresses enjoy being tortured  But were not talking about Soldier  of Fortune violence or Panty Raider sexuality  here
Anyway the aesthetics of it the humor the My Pet  Dungeon feature and the overall attention to detail make it a hoot  to explore even if it doesnt have a lot of depth particularly for casual  gamers with a dark sense of humorWe waited quite a while for Dungeon Keeper  to come out and bought it immediately when it did On one hand its great for a sequel People who played DK will easily be able to pick up on moving units building rooms  lining corridors with traps
The graphics are better in the sense that  theyre more geared towards future development Instead of pixelbased  graphics the creatures and rooms are now drawn with polygons While that  makes some of the monsters look clumsy it does mean that future graphics  will be much smoother and cleaner
Going down into your dungeon by  possessing a creature does not cause the creatures to turn into a cloud of  dots  the rooms you roam through are still crisp and easy to see Roaming  through your own dungeons is one of the true pleasures of this game  too
There are only a few extra rooms  youd have hoped for much more  from a sequel that took this long to make The casino is neat if only  because a jackpotwinning minion starts dancing and singing when he wins  Disco Inferno
Rooms have better graphics though The henhouses in  the hatchery the onwall bookshelves and torture racks everything shows a  subtle touch
If choosing between DK and DK Id definitely recommend  people get this game The challenges and gameplay in DK are better than  DK and DK has many new extra features like Pet Dungeons
New players  will appreciate having a well crafted game that is a fun challenge while  experienced players will appreciate the subtle differences between the old  and new version
Dont expect a masterpiece of Sequelhood but do expect  a fun strategy gaming experience that will last quite a whileBack in  a little game called Myst appeared Everyone went crazy for  it  it featured amazing graphics addicting search and explore gameplay  and it was actually educational A main part of the game was reading so it  figures that many parents were so supportive of it It was also though  terribly spooky at times You could be anywhere in the world of Myst and  still feel a general sense of well spookiness
But Myst was in    and even though it held well throughout several years which is  amazingly good it started to be noticed more as a classic than current  technology
So how well can Riven The Sequel To Myst hold up  against current technology and the original classic By simply  making the adventure more intresting more long and with more  spookiness  an original Mystcliche that adds drama to the  game
Riven is even more rewarding than Myst so  much to the fact that it is sometimes speechless Theres five CDs to the  game  thats clearly enough for anyone to buy this game Even as it  starts out you better look for clues The developers made it so that if  you do not look for enough information you could go from one disc to  another in less than  minutes
The graphics while nice arent the  best in the world Even the control using the Playstation controller is  sometimes sticky But believe me youll get used to it
Its definetly  worth a buy from any fans of the Myst eraI initially gave this one star because it was crashing on me constantly but I recently narrowed it down to a plugin I was using for my porsche wheel Game plays well and looks gorgeous when image spanned across three monitors I would have given it five stars if it wasnt for the annoying Microsoft Games for Live application that makes you go through hoops to set it up and causes problems of its own occasional crashesMech Warriors  is a game that no doubt has revolutionized the graphics industry There is no other way to put it the graphics are really great surprising for an older game The game is so fun and I like the way you can customize the way your bot looks moves and fires My friend did something that was so cool I do it too He took one of the heavyweights and put on almost  LRMs and two gause riflesProbably the best weaponone on each hand He then battled several of those tiny robotswhos name escapes meand took em out indian style It was cruel but totally awesome I use that tactic almost every time on battle mode
If you go to options you can turn off the heat sensorsI hate them and put on invincibility which is also cool
For kids whos parents dont like them getting violent games probably dont want this because of how discusting it is to kill one of the people running on the ground It reminds me of Halflife
I think this game is worth it new or used and recommend it to botlovin kidsThe first foremost negative aspect about this game is the fact that it doesnt really have a soundtrack Its only got two songs on the CD and this is quite a shock and disapointment since for example Mechwarrior  Mercenaries had a full awesome soundtrack Nevertheless the  songs seemlesly integrate themselves into the feeling and the repeats arent that noticeable

The game has a good plot good graphics and good action In multiplayer its even better but the system of finding a server could have been easier and more straightforward Matching is done via a Microsoft website where you can find games and chatrooms and you also need to have installed Zonematch a small program similar to MSN Messenger In my opinion everything should be incorporated into an ingame multiplayer interface just like the majority of other titles out there

You along with other troops are sent on a mission to neutralize enemy forces occupying a planet As you reach orbit the dropships are shot down by enemy forces You have to fight your way through meet up with your other lancemates that were also shot down and find a way to get off the planet alive while at the same time driving to accomplish your mission

The game puts you in the cockpit of awesome powerful ton humanoid warmachines with enough firepower to level a city The array of mechs and arsenal wont disappoint Customize your warmachine any way you want and take it to the battlefield

I especially like the mission commentaries video feeds and voice acting theyre very well done and really help create the overall atmosphere

BE ADVISED The game out of the box may have slight incompatibility issues with Windows XP especially if you have Service Pack  installed so make sure you grab yourself the latest game update patch from the internet Once patched it runs without any problemsIve loved all of the Mechwarrior games they are always so easy stand and pick other Mechs off at extreme long range Besides graphics changes the two big changes are a nice zooming rectile to make those longrange shots easier and a Mobile Field Base that will fix you up in the middle of a mission All of this makes the campaign short just  hours or so
I had one glaring problem it wouldnt install or run on Windows  Maybe I could have gotten it to run if I had hunted down and handinstalled all the files It ran without a single hitch on Windows SEThis is a great drinking game  Try it sometimes with a couple of you drinking buddies its a great game to see who can catch the biggest fish or even team up and play a tourney  The best part is the more fish you catch the drunker you all will get  Very fun game and another must have game for the Dreamcast systemthis game is very boring is not even little bit of fun the graphics are good the game is a person on a boat and fishing how boring is that if you like fishing rent it first because the game could be boring to you tooive played all the capcom maevel games and this is the best the hulk is actually green not pink or grey but green like he is suposed to bethe rounds go fastNFL K is one of the best football games ever First of all it has great graphicsit also has great play calling interface and last but not least begginers can get used to the game fast Some of the flaws in this game is that there is no franchise mode and  when you whant to play a season the space to save a season on your VMU is outrageous  blocks of space leaving you with ten blocks of space left One last problem is the running game there is know way in hell that your running back is ever going to run for a  yard touchdown because it is amazing just to be able to run  yards in this game Well i have told you the pros and the cons about the game if you ask me though the cons did not stop me from liking this gamethere are some games that i walk away from either whanting my money back or being truly ticked off but not this oneI am not a big football person but this game has sparked my interested  I am enjoying the play action the realistic graphics and all the high quality sound  It is worth owningNFL K is a great game for the money  Youll have a lot of fun playing  The graphics are great  The gameplay is simple and good  I think its playable even for someone who does not know football but wants to play this game bc of its raved reviews The play diagrams tell where the players are going doing and the players in play are tagged with control button icons so you know exactly whom your QB has to pass the ball Its great for beginners as well as experienced players  The only problem I see is the inability for a second player to call timeouts  This is actually a BIG problem Thats why it gets  stars instead of Alright ill start off with the badthen the good The first bad part of the game that plagues every sport game it takes to much blankin memory Good lord the back says it takes hey they were incorrect sounds like it doesnt make a difference well it doesif it took as much as they say it didi wouldnt have had to delete game files to play itanother thing although the games sound is excellent the voive over becomes repetetive after some amount of hours in gameplay Now to the good The gameplay is greatdecently fast with varied difficulty levels However if youre playing rookie then you move up to proits almost impossible the learning curve is high But the graphics look really greatim not comparing this game to its more famous counterpart nflk Im saying the graphics are great sound is just as greatand gameplay is excellent You can create your own playerit has a good create a player modeor even a teamhowever what really stinks is you cant play with a created team in a seasonthats stupid Now the season mode is pretty coolyou could have fun with this even if you dont like football and if you do like me youll have ablast And with the great price it has it wont put a big bend in your walletsolidI like sports games and find many of them are good value for money But I have found many of the nfl games to be hard to play If you didnt know  much about the plays etc then it made it even harder But not as much with  nfl k sure it helps if you know abit about the plays but there is a  feature where the dc can select a play for you A good way to get started  The graphics are brilliant but still has some problems every now and  again The ref is at times poorly done and forget about the sideline  graphics But the stadiums and players are amazing The few problems the  game does have i am sure will be worked out in nfl k But overall this  game is a ton of fun with a lot of playabilityThis is a great game but has some audio bugs that are annoying sometimes a sound sticks and repeats over and over or the commentators who  comment on the wrong team at halftime etcDont you remember the times about  or so years ago before the vs games like XMen Vs Street Fighter or Marvel Super Heroes Vs Street Fighter were out when you were at your local malls arcade room and you spent so much time and needed money on this one game everyone was lining up to play you kept winning and no one could beat you you had a blast and you ruled the arcade you used the Amazing SpiderMan or Good Ol Stars and Stripes himself Captain America and maybe a little Incredible Hulk was throw in just to show off your skills with multiple players and you used the Infamouse Yellow Blue Green and all other Gems you could get your hands on to build Speed Strength Power Defence and pretty much eveything else with your character Well I do and I was so stoked when it came out and now you can bring those great feelings back with the PSX Version of this classic fighter from Capcom

Gameplay Almost arcade perfect with minimal slowdowns barely noticeable and you can still pull off everything in here that was possible in the arcade version

Sound Perfect unmuffled voices that match perfectly to all characters and music is still hereand still ruleswith no remixesThank God Music plays just like you would hear it in the arcade

Graphics Great considering the Ram limitations of the PSXlike that was a problem for this game in the st place and they were done with POLYGONS yes POLYGONS

Characters You get a line up of the following characters
 SpiderMan My favorite Maximum Spider

 Captain America Justice Will Prevail

 The Incredible Hulk Whats to say hes a Monster hahahahahahasorry

 Magneto He rules and can pull off great combos

 Wolverine The cheap one

 Juggernaut Hes huge and probably deals more damage than anyone

 Iron Man With the Infamouse Proton Cannon

 Blackheart A good and Cheep caharacter but not as much as Wolvie

 Psylocke One of my favorite Xmen and overall choice over Wolvie to bad Gambit wasnt included

 ShumaGorath Not used by me but still deals damage needed to prevail in this game

OverAll If I could a  but I cant so  out of  the reason being could have been one point better if it werent for the PSX limitations but man that definetly didnt stop me from getting it AT ALL GET IT IF YOU DONT HAVE IT

Thanks to Amazoncom for posting this review and YOU for reading itNot sure whether to give this a  or a  This is kind of like a first person shooter like halflife only you are too weak to really get into big  fights It has some RPG elements but only barely The graphics are ugly  but i dont really care about graphics The respawning monsters but not  respawning ammo are annoying and the weapons that break after a couple of  shots are MAJORLY ANNOYING  That alone is reason to have the author  kicked But despite all of that the game is actually fun to play and the  story is somewhat interesting You could consider Deus Ex to be System  Shock  since its extremely similar only with better technology and  weapons that dont break as easily although the ammo is still limited   none of these are Quake kiling sprees But SS is a fun game you just got  to keep your expectations somewhat low because there are a lot of little  annoying things hereI really cant say enough good things about this game  Firstly the code  is rocksolid  Its probably the only D game thats ever played on our  clunky home computer without crashing or giving us glitches  It also has  an atmosphere that constantly sends prickles down your spine and encourages  you to do more than shoot everything in sight
This game WILL scare you  As you fall into the world youll start to jump at every bump and hiss  around you and if you hear a monkey chattering youll probably start  trying to shoot evrtything in sight
Another interesting aspect is that  at the start of the game you get to choose if you want to be a straight out  soldier a psychic or a technical minded fellow  The skills that you  choose can allow you to slip through the many traps and dangers in the  game
The plot is that you are a soldier who has just recieved some  cybernetic implants  You wake up from coldsleep not knowing quite who you  are or how you got to where you are and only have a voice on your comm  telling you what you need to do  Youre given help in the form of  cybernetic modules that upgrade your skills and allow you to gain new ones  You pick up weapons from fallen monsters and also gain healing  items
But you do more than just shoot things  You have to operate  machinery you gather up bits of crewmembers logs to piece together the  truth you perform chemical analysis on alien organs to find out what they  are and you hack into replicator systems to try and get useful  items
There were only two annoyances in this game firstly weappons  degraded after use at a very unrealistic rate and the monsters kept  respawning even if you wiped an area clean of them  BUT the developers  were kind enough to come up with a patch you can download to fix this  particular problem so its not that big of a deal
Usually Im a  straightout adventure game player and I avoid st person shooters but  SSII changed my opinion of them remarcably  It was great to actually sink  my teeth into something with plotSystem Shock  follows many conventions of a roleplaying game with considerable firstperson action involved  Like Thief whose engine was used to create System Shock  the objective is not  necessarily to kill everything in sight but to achieve the required goals  You play a new recruit onboard a starship fighting against alien viruses  and the ships evil main computer  You start with some initial skills of  your choice and are given chances to improve your skills as the games  progresses  The goals you need to achieve range from mundane to  complicated locating crucial items unlocking rooms restore power to  equipments hacking into terminals scouring dead astronauts journals for  clues collecting chemicals from laboratories that enable you to research  on technologies that help you combat your enemies find tools that repair  and maintain your weapons and so on  My favorite puzzle is finding pieces  of a secret code hidden among the numerous video screens on one of the  levels
Unfortunately firstperson combats are not as fun as they could  be  Monsters respawn shudder  And depending on the skills you  acquired at the start of the game you may not be skillful enough to combat  efficiently at the beginning and will be prone to dying over and over  again and having to keep restoring your save games which on my Pentium II   with MB takes over  minute per restore
Also the  cyberenvironment in System Shock which many loved is not in this gameMega Man Legends is a great new series for mega man  The story takes him to an island searching for energy crystals on his dig adventures  Game play is fun and easy to learn  The game has plenty of secret goodies for you too discovery adding hours of replay value  easy and fun to play but not easy enough that youll only spend ohone week or so one it  Loads of fun a most have for hardcore mega man and new mega man fans of all agesNBA K is not the best basketball game for the DC  NBA K is better  K  you can play network games has more players including classic players better moves and controls no more not catching a pass or passing the ball to someone out of bounds no more crazy camera angle changes that sometimes cause you a turnover bc you walked backcourt etc  But NBA K is a great game  Its better than EA sports or anyother Bball games out there  The graphic is excellent controls are easy to use and simple and playing against the computer is a good challenge  Its quite addictive because it takes a little time to become good  So most likely you will lose to the computer at first even with the best team  Dont get discouraged you will become better and so will your players really This game was a blast At least  years ago for me But I have fond memories of it and enjoyed playing it with friends Thats all I have to say about thatNot that many golf games in the video game industry can actually sell very very well Most of them use a major players name and suppose to have their skills in the process Not that many of them can have a strong sense of enjoyment in the golf world where everyone wants a more serious side in the sports world with football and basketball However Nintendo seemed to hit the nail on the head with their  creation
With Mario Golf the game consists of the start of four golfers including Baby Mario Peach and a couple of others Throughout the game you can access the Get Character mode which can help you challenge other characters like Mario Bowser and Yoshi Once you win the character you also need them the harder the challenger in the round It is also important in the Tournament mode where you can also earn enough points toward newer golf courses and challenging holes in the process Each course reflecting on the cute Mario Brothers themed style which makes it appealing to all ages old and young where the other games dont seem to have that sense of enjoyment
Although Nintendo stopped making games for the Nintendo  Mario Golf is only one of the very few sports games I highly recommend for the system Although many people might not see the review because of the newer game system reviews and newer games of the Gamecube Xbox and Playstation Broke within the first day but hell its a N GS what do you expect It can in very nice condition and worked perfectly till it frozeThis game is excellent The replay value is infinite there are many characters courses etc available for the dedicated player to find On  top of that there are multiple modes for up to four players Two or three players is usually enough though with  players people usually get bored
The graphics are adequate for the game However the sound is pretty abysmal The music is absolutely terrible on almost every course and it is recommended that you turn it off
I also would have enjoyed a createaplayer mode However this game is the best fun golfing can offer with its many courses characters and game modesIve seen some of the reviews and this item is notorious for just dieing well its cheap enough it dies ill get another it does what its supposed to do cheat your way to victory and enjoy your old games again  Make sure the terminals on your game are clean or it wont workWhen buying a Game Shark to use with certain games you should keep a few things in mind For one this is kind of cheating when playing a game So if youre playing a really complicated game and youre telling people Oh yeah I beat that game in like two days But you were also invincible and had unlimited ammo its not as much to brag about as someone who used no cheats and beat it in three or four days On the flipside video games are supposed to be entertaining dont mix entertaining up with ruling your life get out of the house every now and then Anyway theyre supposed to be entertaining and there is nothing entertaining about playing the same level  times in one week trying to figure out how the hell you get on the other side of this wall to flip the switch to open the door youre stuck behind and have to get through in order to get the switch and blah blah blah You know THAT whole bit Using a Game Shark can let help you get through so you could later one day play the game without any cheats and when you run into a wall you can be like Heh heh BLOW IT UP or you know whatever it is you figured out with the Game Shark It can also help make games that are too challenging for you and make them easier for you Different people have different ideas of entertainment Some like a challenge and some just like to blow things up or walk into a building of about  or  people and take them all out without getting a scratch on them Whether you love or hate them I think everyone owns one or two at one point in their gaming phase I know I thought they were lame and just taking the easy way out but I have one for my Nintendo  Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advanced I dont have much time to play video games like I did when I was younger but when I do get the time to pick one up I want to be entertained Some days I like a challenge and other days I just wanna fly through a few levels real quick just to pass the time and actually have gotten somewhere

These things usually come loaded with tons of codes for games If you have a lot of games that arent on it you can Google the title of the game followed by a comma one of these things  and the word gameshark or gameshark codes You can also remove games from the gameshark that youll never use You completely control what codes are loaded into the gameshark and what codes are activeEver get tired of playing a video game Just get a Gameshark This product lets you use it to enter codes into any game to modify it Extra lives extra equipment unlimited this or that and anything you want With the Gameshark and its codes you enter the codes once and the Gameshark saves them so that you do not have to ever type them again Plus the Gameshark comes with s of codes for s of games already preloaded on it If you get tired of entering codes then there is something on the back of the shark that lets you hook it into your PC so you can type codes on your PC The Gameshark includes with a video that shows you how to make your very own codes Master hackers for games like WWF No Mercy and Star Wars Pod Racer have even made entire new levels and totally changed the gameI just bought the N version of the Gameshark and am somewhat satisfied with the results I own No Mercy which is plagued by glitches Gameshark allowed me to gain all that I had lost in the game by unlocking all the secrets A great peripheral for those who are stuck in a game Unfortunately there are some glitches Apparantly some games wont work with it as my Resident Evil  kept locking up when I tried it with Gameshark Also there are reports of it breaking after a few months of use All in all a good tool but buyer bewareThe Sega Dreamcast controller is still one of the best designed and assembled game pads that I ever used In highsight while awkward and uncomfortable now compared to more recent designs it was perfectly suited to the Dreamcasts D games while still being simple enough for people to easily grasp Its also generally comfortable to handle for hours making it a perfect fit for weekend long gaming marathons and is very responsive for standard gaming fare on the Dreamcast The colorful main buttons are situated on the right side directly opposite of the analog thumb stick and the Dpad with the triangle Start button smack dab in the middle near the bottom There are also single left and right index finger triggers on the underside of the controller The overall layout make the controller intuitive and easy to learn allowing you focus on playing the game It also features two expansion slots to accommodate a couple of accessories like multiple Visual Memory Units and a single Rumble Pack or even a microphone depending on how its configured To me the only strange thing about the overall design of the controller is that the power cord is connected at the bottom which is a little unorthodox Luckily it can conveniently be secured in the tradtional forward position on the underside of the unit to accommodate gamers with old school preferences Unfortunately like other people have mentioned the Sega Dreamcast controller it isnt ideal for playing fighting games The shoulder triggers are simply placed a little to far back and feel a little bit awkward to use effectively not without throwing a minor hitch in your mechanics in the beginning Pulling off some of the more complicated moves in Street Fighter consistantly is next to impossible for me So the Dreamcasts pad is merely adequate in this particular area and takes a little time to get used to but it isnt a deal breaker In its defence no standard controller can truly replace a traditional arcade stick in handling the precise quick and smooth movements not to mention the  dedicated and responsive face buttons that Capcom and SNK brawlers practically demand Luckily Agetec released a stick just for the Sega Dreamcast to address these various issues and manages to bring the arcade feeling home a definite must have for diehards Overall Id still highly recommended this purchase for a person who still enjoys playing games on the best console that Sega ever made the Dreamcast After all it always helps to have an extra controller handy when playing Power Stone  Chu Chu Rocket or numerous other classic multiplayer titles from the Dreamcast library when friends drop by and are itching to get a piece of the actionThe Dreamcast controller is similar to the XBOX controller the only difference is XBOX has more buttons  The triggers are pretty much the same the analog stick is above the dpad so if you added Select Black and White buttons and another analog stick itd be exactly the same as XBOX  However the lack of these in Dreamcasts severely limits gaming possibilities  For most PS games the right analog stick allows players to rotate the camera around their character  Without that if camera controls are needed in a dreamcast game the L and R triggers normally are assigned for that  This limits the options for useable buttons  Also that right analog stick is sorely missed in first person shooter games which are rare on the Dreamcast to begin with  The games that are available invariably use the A B X Y buttons for directional movement and the analog stick for aiming  So when compared to Halo which makes use of those buttons on the xbox controller for reload jump switching weapons and melee attacks they are incredibly hampered by this

This controller is great for RPGs like Skies of Arcadia fighter games like Soul Calibur and platform games like Sonic Adventure  But dont buy Hidden and Dangerous or Rainbow Six or even Quake III Arena because after playing FPSs on XBOX and PS shooter games on Dreamcast are really a step downI dont really have much to say about this controller except that its got some cool buttons  But it looks awkward  It seems like you could break it on accident if you pull it sidewaysI had to write a followup review now that about  years has passed since my last one and two sequels to this game have been published  Despite playing the newer games I dusted off and fired up my old copy of Jedi KnightMystery of the Sith JKMOtS and had a blast  The two are obviously dated but dont suffer as much in comparison in terms of game play as the original Dark Forces circa  had in light of JKMOtS  Like DF all the games in the Jedi Knight series are first person shooters  JKMOtS added the lightsaber and force powers with an enhanced game engine  besides better graphics and sound it was now possible to combine moth horizontal and vertical head movements using the mouse DF had separate buttons for vertical looking which made the interface feel exceedingly clunky in comparison  Also basic movements were more natural  you never had that feeling prevalent in DF that you were a golf cart instead of a person
But above the improved engine JK excelled because it was as much a SW experience as it was a game  with a tight story line excellent level design and filmed FMV cut scenes  Most people hated the cutscenes  poorly acted and not very effects laden  but I loved them they added to the movielike feeling and anyway Attack of the Clones had horrible acting and scenes that went on much longer You never had that feeling of other shooter games where you suddenly stopped and wondered  OK where am I what am I looking for and why am I hitting all of these buttons  The story returns prorebel mercenary Kyle Katarn to the fore  Learning that his father was killed by an evil dark jedi named Jerec Kyle sets off on a mission of revenge Soon he learns more  that Jerec rules an entire faction of imperials intent on locating the lost Valley of the Jedi also featured in Jedi Outcast  The burial place of countless jedi the valley also holds a bottomless reservoir of their force power  The plot has Kyle tracking a traitorous droid named T from Nar Shadaa to his fathers home planet of Sulon the droid decodes a map leading to the valley  the map is then destroyed  Great level design makes each player map seem less a map than a place that must be navigated  AI suffers in terms of the imperial troops  who prove bad enough before their blasters are forcegrabbed away  Balancing that out the game is generous with boss modes  sending you up for  lightsaber duels with the dark jedi including the climactic duel with Jerec  Personally I hated the saber duels  they always seemed to boil down to hopping and slashing with sabers  Jedi Outcast is most improved in that respect  there are much better looking duels and more of them  Your force powers are divided between generic powers speed jump sight and those specific to light heal persuasion or dark lightning forces  Your reliance on dark or light powers and your ability to keep from killing various innocent bystanders will determine whether you are a light or dark jedi  The consequent difference for one side or another is not that great  mostly it determines which of Jerecs evil jedi you will fight in one of the latter duels and which cut scenes youll watch  Sound and graphics compare well with the newer games and the overall plot makes you feel like youre in a Star Wars movie
This edition also comes with Mysteries of the Sith  a companion disk that uses a slightly altered game engine and was originally released separately but otherwise required JK be installed  In MotS you play Katarn for the first several missions then assume the role of Mara Jade a former imperial agent brought to the light her character was introduced in the novels of Timothy Zahn  The tight plotting of the first game is gone  replaced by looser story arcs as Kyle you must save a rebel base from an imperial ground assault then destroy an orbiting asteroid the imperials are using to stage their attack as Mara you will infiltrate the palace of Kapa the Hutt and then in a switch go to work for him you will also track down and try to retrieve a jedi holocron and save a rebel corvette from marauding pirates eventually you will follow Kyle back to a mysterious planet of the Sith where its dark and swampy the locals are hostile and hungry and your weapons dont work  If uneven MotS has its share of thrills and challenges  AI is noticeably improved with stormtroopers ready to go fisticuffs when their blasters are forcegrabbed and gameplay is much more challenging on the whole  Should you tire of the levels provided an entire online community has crafted single and multiplayer levels for both games
In short both games are still great values and enjoyment isnt terribly undermined by your having played Jedi Outcast  though its obviously not the mindblowing experience of  still its aged better than the Spice Girls  If youve got a P  its just an excuse to turn the graphics up to excessive  I first played this on my PMMX computer with VoodooII graphics acceleration and enjoyed every minute  On my P I had no Windows XP problems and was able to crank graphics to the fullIve always loved the board game version of Life  I played it hundreds of times with my family while I was growing up  The computer game version stuck to the board game as closely as possible  You spin the wheel exactly like the board game your little car moves around just like the board game they even copied the board almost exactly
Its pretty fun  Ive played it a few dozen times and really enjoyed it  I wish that when you are generating your character there were a few more options your character choices are EXTREMELY limited but that is the only real fault I could find with the game
The graphics are cartoonish  but it fits  Whenever you land on a spot there is a short little clip showing what happened to you  these are pretty funny  Overall its a cute game  It would be perfectly acceptable for kids too  there is nothing bad in the game at all  Since its so cheap I definitely recommend getting it and playing around especially if youre a fan of the board gameI found the game to be alright I love the real board game so the I was pretty excited to play the computer versionBut if you are expecting a version exactly like the game this isnt it  There are some changes like  payback and all that ITs fun to pick your people and get your house and  all that  Its cool how it goes through the decades and all that  If you  liked the game I think youll like the board game but be warned Like the  game the mroe people that play the betterThis is a good game for the whole family and friendI play with my younger  brother all the time and my friends too This game is very realistic like on  TVits has over  puzzles to solve This PC version is better then the  N version Ive play ENDStar Wars Rebellion has been around for a while and with the neverending stream of Star Wars games being released by LucasArts it is surely being relegated to the backwaters of Star Wars gamers consciousness Its graphics arent as gorgeous as Rogue Squadron or any of its sequels and its style real time strategy may not be as popular as either firstperson shooters a la Bounty Hunter or even The Phantom Menace
Yet to some strategygamers like Yours Truly Rebellion known in the UK as Star Wars Supremacy does have its virtues While it is a strategy game on a galactic scale it does combine elements of roleplaying players can send major Star Wars characters from page and film on missionsand space warfare at the tactical level once a player has built a few fleet units they can be sent from their territory into enemy systems to invade planets or engage opposing fleets
Players can choose to play as either the Empire or the Rebel Alliance choose the level of difficulty and the amount of planetary systems that will appear in the Galactic Information Display The tougher the level the more systems will gravitate to the oppposite side  The object of the game of course is to control as much of the Star Wars galaxy as one can with each side having ultimate victory goals that must be achieved  To be more precise the Rebels must capture both Darth Vader and the Emperor while at the same time taking and holding Coruscant
The Empires mission is similar but trickier  Not only are Mon Mothma and Luke Skywalker to be in Imperial custody but Alliance HQ must be destroyed But unlike Coruscant the Rebel HQ complex it looks like Cloud City can be moved from one Alliance controlled system to another  Those who find the complete Victory conditions to be too hard at first might choose the HQonly option
Things I like about Rebellion
 The main title sequence Most good Star Wars games pay homage to their parent media source the films by having the a long time ago in a galaxy far far away card and the title crawl setting up the games storyline  Rebellion is set immediately after Episode IV so in some ways the game can be used to imagine alternate timelines and different outcomes to those we saw in the movies  Actual cues from the John Williams scores add that touch of genuine Star Wars atmosphere to this starting screen
 The use of characters from books and films  Although Rebellion shows its age by incorporating worlds and characters mentioned in books published up to  I like the fact that the game designers did not limit the cast of agents to just the canon film characters  Fans of such Expanded Universe characters as Grand Admiral Thrawn Talon Karrde Borsk Feylya Labria and Pellaeon will find them included here  The one limiting factor is that only a few major characters will have audio cues included in their mission reports and even those get old fast if you play the game in one sitting so dont expect to hear the famous Thrawns musings or Chewbaccas growls  I also like the fact that certain characters have strong Diplomacy ratings Leia Mon Mothma Piett Jerjerrod and of course Vader and the Emperor that only get better with each mission while others are better at Combat and Espionage
 The graphics OK The game is not new and its showing its age but those fleet battles are still pretty cool  They may not be very varied and at times its best to just go to the Results screen if you send say a Star Destroyer or two against a system defended by one XWing squadronor a Mon Cal cruiser against a single TIE squadron
What I dont like
 It depends too much on mouse clicks Another reviewer called this game the Death by  Clicks or something along those lines  I have gotten used to this but getting used to something doesnt mean you have to like it
 Team building  Supposedly you can make a team of various characters to accomplish missionsor send out decoys to divert the enemy While fine in theory either the program is faulty or I am as dense as a Kowakian monkeylizard  It did take me several months just to figure out the basic game even after reading the manual but geezI still cant get the Team thing done
 Predictability on Easy level OK I dont enjoy pain much so I tend to avoid switching levels on PC games but I have noticed that the Empire never attempts to build a Death Star on Easy level  It DOES drain resources and maybe when I play as the Rebels I dont give the AI Empire time to gather raw materials for a battle station but cmonto never try
For an older game it is not without its bugs  it does crash from time to time and some of its features do get annoying but Rebellion is still entertaining and fun to play  What more can one ask of a game designed in the late s for Windows except maybe a Prequel edition or a revamped Classic TrilogyEU version with new graphicsLucas Arts has come out with some notable fiascos over the past few years as far as games are concerned Force Commander XWing vs Tie Fighter which is only good in multiplayer StarFighter etc This is one of thier outings that I actually would rate at   stars and is one of the most misunderstood and underrated games to come out of George Lucass computer game brainchild
  The premise is simple You are given control of either the Empire under Emperor Palpatine or the Rebel Alliance under Mon Mothma If you start out as the Imperials youll get a significant advantage in technology and capital ships as well as more developed worldsplus you have a bonafide Jedi in Darth Vader who can detect and train Jedi Students as he discovers them making these officers even more valuable more on this later The Rebels start off with nd rate capital ships and planets that are far flung for the most part Thier base is moveable and under the circumstances thats a good thing since part of the Imperials goals is to destroy the Rebel base
  Ill try to simplify this game but its not an easy task Depending upon the size of the galaxy you have picked Small Medium Huge etc your goal is to colonize planets and develop them use diplomacy to introduce other cultures either into the Rebellion or the Empire or outright conquer enemy planets These planets can then be equipped with varying tools to make use of thier inherent commoditiesfor instance one planet might have multiple Shipyards for building your navy while others might be resource sytems used only for mining and maintaining your credit flow Characters in the game each have inherent usessome can do Ship Research others can be used for Diplomacy while others can be sent to Sabotage enemy worlds and ships If the Character has been detected to be a Force User then a Jedi Knight or Master can begin to train them resulting in a Character with increased scores for thier particular specialty In addition Characters can be places in positions of Authority either in Fleets or on Planets Admiral Ackbar can lead one fleet while Lando Calrissian can General it thus resulting in your fleets doing more damage and taking less hits in battles
  Research is a lot of fun and can be begun almost from the beginning in one of three areas Ship research New ship designs fighters etc Building design New Planetary Shields Improved Shipyards and Troop Design Dark Troopers Sullastan Regiments Typically whoever has a leg up in Research has an easier time controlling the game and its highly recommended that if you find any NPCs Wedge Antilles can do Ship Research Bevel Lemelisk can do all three typesto start ASAP
  The part everyone wants to know about though is the gigantic ship battles and man they can get epic Theres nothing like seeing  Rebel ships do battle with the same number of Imperial ones and engagements can run up to  minutes The graphics of these battles are a little dated by todays standards but still seeing a Calamari Cruiser turn sideways to exchange broadsides with a Star Destroyer is a sight to see Fighters swarm around the whole time sniping at enemy fighters or helping engage the big capital ships Theres different options for your ships to maneuver into position for attacks but as far as I can see theyre for the most part pointless as both fleets typically run straight for the other and begin duking it out
  Single player is fun but gets dreary after a while especially if youre playing as the Rebels The Imperials generally name thier ships at the beginning but the database for ship names must be shallow because soon after youll start seeing such inspiring names as Carrack Cruiser  or Star Destroyer  And the most glaring deficiency in Single player mode is that the Imperials will never build a Death Star Ever Leading me to want to shout The Death Star plans are not in the main computer
  This game becomes sterling in multiplayer though and if you ever wanted to play a strategy game on an almost epic level this is definitely a game you want to check out A human will almost invariably play by different strategies than the computer will and oftentimes youll find different and sometimes very unique methods employed for winning My brother tends to build zillions of fighters on each planet he owns making capital ship conquest almost impossible to accomplish without matching the number of fighters in your own fleet My nephew builds heavily into Capital ships with a mixed escort screen basically heavy on planetary bombardment I tend to make a mixture of the two aiming for a well rounded task force And when Turn  hits and youre still grappling for control of the galaxy with your opponent well lets say that it never wears down on you If ever you get a chance to build a Death Star do it It is an incredible rush to build one secretly moving it suddenly and unexpectedly into your opponents main manufacturing planets orbit and then hitting Destroy Planet watching half of his shipbuilding capability go up in a blaze of smoke and rubble
  Unless you have a LAN at home and know someone who wants to try this gem of a game out the only place youll be able to play is on Gamespy and Internet Gaming Zone but expect games to be very long and drawn out sometimes lasting as much as a week depending upon how often you have to save and reload
  The mediocrity of the Single player game is more than made up for in Multiplayer Trust me and grab a copy and see for yourself Anyone ever play Privateer Armada  This really reminds me of that allot  The great sweeping star wars saga has been replaced by nothing more then a third rate game of chess The special effects are cheesy and the socalled battles take forever  Save your money and dont buy this one
If you want a great Star Wars game get XWing or XWing AllianceStar Wars fans should be grateful for this game
This is a  strategy game and even in the galactic battles you need to double think which spaceship to send against which
The idea of the game is simple manage your economic resources wisely as well as your politics and military to gain supremacy over the other side
Youll need to select destinations for your mines refineries development labs training facilities etc so as to maximize output and grab the most out of them
One thing you have to take into account is how changing the game is in some part you can be lured to assume youll wipe out your opponent in a couple of turns when you angrily realize he has taken control of  or  of your planets leaving you with most of your spaceyard or building facilities out
Get enough patience because the game is long and pretty hard to understand but once the efforts been made its really worth itAs the other reviewers point out this is an hillariously addicting little game  The game works find in the Windows ME environment but Ive yet to get it to work in XP I just use a dual boot system to play this gameSweet  Ive been around since the original XWing and Im glad to see the advances  Remember the original floppydisk XWing for MSDOS  The ships were nothing more than  a few singlecolored polygons and the HUD  only showed a picture of the ship not the actual moving ship  Plus you  had  ships well okay  ships after the Bwing expansion pack to pick  from  The dumb racing track took over ten minutes to go through one lap  and the missions were close to impossible  But we didnt mind because that  was the best a computer could offer back then  Well not weve got  extremely detailed ships with moving gun turrentswow   with D  accelerated graphics over  ships you use about  of them in the real  game many more in multiplayer you can fly and newfangled light sources  Plus you go into the Death Star on this one  It isnt like that  twocolored gray surface from XWing  Now its got  million colors  Unfortunately some of the difficulty from XWing moved over to XWing  Alliance  Its just a WEE bit hard  Some missions will have you laughing  at the enemy while others will make you slam your computer desk  Fortunately you can put it on easy mode cant do that in XWing  Plus  some of the mission objects may seem a bit too much to handle  But I think  this is only a minor problem  A few missions stand outlike one where  you jump out of hyperspace directly in front of a Super Star Destroyer  for the uninformed a SSD is a BIG mutha ship that you shouldnt go  NEARheck its so bad that youll only see one in the whole game  Overall youll find a great space combat game in this package  Go  onbuy itHouse of the Dead the arcade is the reason I bought a DreamCast I played it at a local movie theater about  months ago and realized and I wanted it at home I did a little research and found out that not only was a home version out it was very affordable and a perfect arcade port
This game is great on the Dream Cast if you have a light gun if you dont this game is not good The user interface for the game was designed for a light gun so if you play with a controller it seems unnatural and you have a desaster almost as big as trying to play Virtual On without the twin sticks 
If you do not have the gun strongly consider buying the Stringer Light Blaster  House Of The Dead  Bundle Pack by Pelican The controller felt better in the hands than an original N controller only giving it  because the thickness of the cord is not really thickI bought this game so that i can replay my own Dreamcast The game worked great but i did notice that if you are using a never LCD flat screen then the laser gun to play the game will not work You have to use an old tube TV which i happened to have and it all worked great My brothers and i spent the entire night playing it I used to play this game in the arcades until my mom would literally drag me outGood game overall Its fun and easy but rewarding The voice overs are so cheesy that its actually funny and enjoyable to listen too If you have not played this game yet and you enjoy mega man get this gameThis controller is very good for what it is If you need a usb controller for NES SNES or Playstation emulation this is a good one to get I bought two of them for NESSNES emulation and I have no major complaints
This pad comes with a small joystick you can screw into the dpad which is awkward and youll never want to use The only problem is that when you have the stick unscrewed the center of the dpad has a threaded metallic hole which can slightly irritate your thumb after a few hours of playing Despite this minor flaw while its not the greatest controller you can buy at this price its an excellent valueOne of the first games released for the Dreamcast House of the Dead  is an instant classic  The game is identical to the arcade smash with the inclusion of exclusive Dreamcast levels and the graphics and detailed zombies will leave your mouth watering  The voice acting is pretty bad though making the voice acting from the first Resident Evil look like Shakespearian acting but that is overlooked by the shoot em up action  A light gun is strongly recommended but the standard DC controler works just as well somewhatThe console light gun game is something of a neglected genre In the case of the Dreamcast that problem can easily be attributed to Sega wussing out on releasing their own gun peripheral in light of the Columbine massacre Thankfully a number of thirdparty companies were willing to pick up the slack and thus by spending some extra cash you can play this highly enjoyable fragathon the way it was MEANT to be played
House of the Dead  gets my vote as the best traditional meaning you kill things light gun game available on a home system Namcos Point Blank series I think has it beat in terms of potential enjoyability but thats another kettle of fish Its also one of the hardest Even on the easiest setting with maximum health and credits blasting your way through it is no small feat Most enemies can sustain multiple shots and dealing with several of them at once while not getting cut or bitten or tackled or whatever will challenge all but the fastest trigger fingers For even more of a challenge just try nailing all of those agonizingly evasive bonus items that appear when you shoot barrels crates etc
House of the Dead  is not content to force you down the same path every time you play Depending on how many civillians you rescue and which ones you will be sent in different directions within the same stage and the bosses will vary their attacks accordingly so its impossible to see everything the game has to offer in one session Of course the civillians are typical helpless weenies begging pathetically for mercy and cowering in corners one guy even dies from a single kick to the rib cage if you dont save him in timeWIMP Their voice acting as well as that of the heroes and villains is unsurprisingly weak but the Bmovie quality sort of adds to the feel of the game
Graphics are mightily impressive and pretty atmospheric too the look of a gloomy European town is captured quite well
The soundtrack while not exactly stellar is certainly passable
Theres also a training mode where you must accomplish tasks like blowing zombies off a moving car Its nowhere near as fun as the main game because theres really no margin for error but its a nice touch nonetheless
Pointing a gun plastic or not at the screen and blasting away is a wonderfully primal visceral video game experience and youd be hard pressed to find a better excuse to do it than this The high level of difficulty may turn some people off but for those of us who can only go for so long without shooting something its a real treat as well as a great reason to own a DreamcastYour gary or james or both and you are off to kill Goldman the one responsible for the  curian case or House of the Dead  You will face an endless number of zombies and kill several bosses Your goal is to stop goldman from destroying all of mankind with his secret weapon which is the final boss of the game The game is fun for a while but eventually gets very boring You can play arcade mode or play original The game bases all on the arcade You can do training mode which has several shooting events you can do until you get  stars on them All different things are in this game and what ive explained is not all of itGory fun and entertaining  Yes House of the Dead  is all that and then some
The graphics in this game are simply amazing a perfect resemblance to that of the arcade game  The animations and textures are used wonderfully  Gameplay is pretty darn solid and the replay value is tremendously good especially if played multiplayer
Dont listen to those who find this game too difficult due to the lack of gun  All you require is a controller some skill and quick reflexes
I highly recommend this game to all DreamcastersI loved this game from the instant that I installed it
Its funny imaginative and actually allows you to ride the rides
Its far too easy being aimed toward a younger audience but that never put me off  I would reccomend this game to anyone who enjoys the Sim series
My only disappointment is the lack of updates  The game is so outdated now that it will no longer run on my PC because of Windows XP being installed

I wish that a newer version would be released so that I can play one of my all time favorites againI will never forget the first time I played this game A friend of mine had been talking about it for months when I was finally able to borrow a PlayStation and rent a copy of this game It is really a fun Action RPG with elements of Mega Man Indiana Jones and ZeldaA Diamond In The Rough

I cant believe I forgot to review this  Ive actually had this game for ages and I even reviewed its horrible sequel Jade Cocoon  but I somehow forgot to actually write a review for this one  Well anyway Ill get on with it  Firstly I should note that if you are a Studio Ghibli fan this game should feel oddly familiar  The art style is from what I understand either directly inspired by Ghibli  or the art design was actually worked on by Studio Ghibil members not totally sure which  The story too also feels pretty Ghibliesque but more on that later  The only other thing Ill mention before I get into the category breakdown is that this game strangely comes in one of those doubleCD cases but only actually has one disc  Its a pretty short game so I have no idea whats going on with that  Maybe the marketing department was trying to fool people into thinking the game was longer  I have no idea  Oh well on with the review

Graphics score  The graphics are decent for their time this game came out a couple years after Final Fantasy VII  The cutscenes are animestyle which is lovely because such animation  pretty much never ages  The ingame background graphics are pretty good  they are quite detailed  The only problem is that sometimes the backgrounds are too detailed  it can be hard to see items on the ground or to determine what is and is not a pathway  The character models are kind of blocky like youd expect for an old PS game but there are ingame character portraits during dialogue which is nice

Music score  The music itself is pretty average for an RPG  Its decent but not astoundingly good or anything  What is of note though is the voice acting  Yes there is voice acting which is unusual for a PS game  Not just that but the voice acting is pretty good  Ive heard better voice acting on more modern games but for a PSera game its pretty darn good  Believe me Ive heard much worse Grandia comes to mind so kudos to the developers for hiring some decent voice actors

Characters score   Sigh I really like this game but it commits one of my most disliked offenses  it has a silent protagonist  Levant never speaks and doesnt possess any sort of personality  Thankfully the other characters make up for it since they actually do have personalities  All the characters have fairly restrained and normal personalities versus some of the exaggerated and wacky characters you can get with a lot of RPGS which feels pretty realistic for the setting  Despite their demure personalities you really start to feel sympathetic for Levant and his wife Mahbu as the game goes on  Having an emotional investment in the characters is a hallmark of a good RPG and Jade Cocoon succeeds on this front

Story score  This game can be described as light on plot but heavy on thematic elements and setting  It relies more on its atmosphere and themes to carry the narrative than on plot twists or an intricate storyline  In fact the actual plot itself is fairly simple  A small village that has always been protected from forest monsters suddenly gets attacked one day and several villagers fall into a sleepingsickness  Its up to Levant and Mahbu his newly married wife to obtain a rare herb from the dangerous forest in order to save them  Even though that sounds pretty simple the actual themes are mature and thoughtprovoking  Remember in the introduction  how I said this game reminds me of Studio Ghiblis works  Jade Cocoon reminds me most of Princess Mononoke since they both have a lot of the same themes  It literally feels like you are playing through a mythological tale or a fable of some type  in fact the very opening of the game features a creation myth complete with a frightening capricious deity before the game sets you up in a more mundane human village  The cultural setting of the game is radically different from a Western one the people inhabiting this tiny village are very much bound up in the rigors of tradition and responsibility is put before personal feelings  Its pretty much the opposite in theme to your typical RPG which is all about running around the world having exciting adventures  Instead of that sense of freedom Jade Cocoon makes you feel the oppressiveness of this cultural tradition and the sad and weighty responsibilities put upon the young protagonists  In fact there are a lot of interesting concepts explored in this game including arranged marriages superstition and mythology religion and creation stories harmony and balance between humans and nature prejudice and morality  The great thing about this game is that it doesnt really answer any of the moral questions it raises for you  its up to the player to ponder themselves

Battle System score  The battle system is a turnbased system that will be instantly understandable to any person whos got a vested interest in RPGs  Whats different about this game is that Levant is the only character you get to fight with and hes actually a pretty weak fighter  Youll spend most of your time summoning monsters to fight for you  Yes Jade Cocoon is a bit of a monsterraising sim  You can capture monsters of various elements earth fire water wind to fight in battle for you  You can also merge two of them together to improve their stats  and their appearance changes  Thats really the biggest selling point of the monsterrelated gameplay  Based on what you choose to merge you can make a monster look however you want it to  Unfortunately youll usually be merging solely for stat boosts or to get certain abilities which can sometimes produce a very fugly monster  Still its an interesting mechanic to play around with  My only complaint with the battle system itself is that the battles can feel a bit slow due to slow animations  Speaking of which the capturing animations are a bit too long for my taste and even though the menu has an off option I cant tell any difference between on and off  Go figure

Gameplay score  This is a bit of a catchall category for me  Sigh this is where this game takes it in the rearend  Jade Cocoon has the worst movement system of any RPG Ive ever played  Remember those old tanklike controls that infested early Resident Evil games  Jade Cocoon has these  Why  Basically Levant slowly pivots left and right and pushing up goes forward no matter what direction hes facing in  Its a good thing the battles are turnbased or this would really be a problem  It is however a bit of a problem in the forests because there are onscreen enemies that are very hard to dodge with these controls  If you hold down the Triangle button Levant will run straight forward  Once you get used to this you can hold down Triangle and sort of steer him left and right but it always feels awkward  In addition to those problems the actual button layout is irritatingly nonstandard  The Circle button opens the main menu and the Triangle button backs out of the menu  If youve played many Final Fantasies as well as many other RPGs you expect that to be the opposite  Aside from the button scheme the actual menus used to do anything are not terribly intuitive and are more convoluted than necessary  For example if you go to the shop first you have to listen to the shopkeeper make random chit chat then you got to a buysellexit menu then you can select buy to get something  Sounds simple enough but no  If you select an item you then have to put in an extra yes Im sure confirmation  Then when you want to leave the shop you cant just hit Triangle to back out you have to select Exit and then listen to the shopkeeper give you some farewell chatting  This problem is especially bad when you are talking to Mahbu Levants wife who basically manages your monsters for you  Whenever you need to do something with her theres a bunch of confirmations to jump through  This isnt a huge deal breaker of a problem but these little extra confirmations are everywhere and they slow down the gameplay  It just makes the game feel unpolished and for a monsterraising sim such a slow management system is unacceptable  On top of all the things previously mentioned the gameplay is a bit repetitive in that theres a very simple villageforest villageforest villageforest pattern and you dont every get to go anywhere else  This isnt too bad though because the game is pretty short so it ends before the repetition drives you mad  All things considered what keeps this game from being fantastic are purely all these gameplay issues

Overall score  NOTE this score is not an average its my subjective overall score  Its a real shame that this game is held back by so many gameplay issues otherwise it wouldve been excellent  The whole game really feels like a diamond in the rough  If you are an RPG enthusiast and can overlook this games rough edges then I still suggest you pick up Jade Cocoon  Its worth a look if only for its unique story and atmosphereI liked being a Cocoon Master I liked hearing old legends told by the voice of the old wise man And I liked a RPG who deals with respect for environment When I accidentally slayed some minions I really felt sorry And I had a lot of fun merging those funny little beasts Buy it if you are tired of the usal fight the evil one RPGthis shakes so much at times it seems hard to stay in control of your games  The design is smaller than what I expected it has quite a kick and the strength that it shakes at seems appropriate for what you hit  it provides that extra oomph that is not provided when you dont have a jump pak or tremor pak or that Mad Catz pak  It shakes the most when you cause rapid rumbles or when you are hit in a game  I would have given it  and a half stars but that was not available so I put it down to  stars  However this is highly reccomended by meAlmost every Dreamcast game supports the jump pack feature  This is because the feedback mechanism adds an extra dimension of fun and interactivity to games  If you are wondering if it is worth the price to add this to your controller  yes it is
My only complaint is that the jump pack should have been built into the original controller  This feature is near standard in all games and it seems like a crass money grab by Sega to force you to buy a second device
I have not tried all of the jump pack devices  However I have tried the TremorPak and the Dreamcast device  I cant really tell a difference other than that the TremorPak seems to vibrate a little stronger than the Dreamcast device  As far as compatibility is concerned it has worked in all of my gamesit has my voteIf you need teambased with a blend of Unreal Tourney and the SciFi Channel heres a good title to work on Its all multiplayer so theres no singleplayer mode besides the training missions Its a hard game to explain but I can say this this game is fun and heck and lets you take any role whether it be a repairman heavy defence or transport pilot Buy this if your computer isnt so hot If you do have a good computer with a GeForce get Tribes  it adds on to the first in almost every way and is a little more fun than this title But get either one Tribes is one of Sierras best titlesThis was a very chanllenging game for me it Took me about three months to beat the even old original  verison way back in mid  I think it was when back when I was about and was midway through my final and last growth ssuppert I belive I later when I was about   got the newer playstation version I unfortunatley due to a couple years lack of experience had to use the invulerability and zeeny to comple in a lower completion time of about maybe  to  hours compared to the original  completer time of about maybe  to   hours maybe more or less This game will be fun once you get used to some changes One megaman like in the later  games of the original series was original drastically increased in size at a huge height of abou  to  six feet tall and abhout probaly weighs about   to maybe  pounds witrh his armor on this is the biggest mega man ever made  Once you learn how to concort the stroneger boss with high atatck strenght and to dog them this may be a piece of cake  To beat Jungo increas e every thing one the midssle launcher to max this will give you infinite ammo With this one the ammo update to unlimited if you pay up enough zeeny You cane beat juno easily Just hold down the button the missle will shot of function like heat seakers As long as you have infinite health slash cantina points one you can sit there turning your missle into the ultimate automatic fire weapon Pushbed the out fire down and  keep shooting them of at rapid speed Even if you get hit you should be able to take this boss down and complety both parts of the battle in about maybe  second   minutes maybeless This  is a fun games I hope you enjopy it even though roll is now longer robotic and Rusha and Beta no longer exist If you like this and want a really challange to test your patience and enduranc eplay the insanly hard megaman legends  also avilable in playstation formathalflife was efficacious in improve my handeye coordination which is compromised as a result of using narcotics for three years  id like to find something that will improve my memory but ive resigned myself to the fact that im going to have to restudy everything ive already learned  yep oxycodone does make you stupid  just look at rush limbaugh
oh  im getting sidetracked  lets not digress
ok why did i give it only  stars 
because after the patch to  and then   the final comprehensive patch  freeman would still get stuck on lifts and elevators and die
when he gets stuck you cant move him or make him jump and he takes damage and gets crunched  i dont know why the patches never resolved this problem
but the problem of getting stuck on lifts and elevators has a fix  read some of the faqs  if you jiggle the controller around a bit freeman wont get stuck
what else 
every time i tried to load a saved game from the game it would crash my system  i had to exit the game and restart the game i wanted  i could save without a problem and quick save and quick load f and f worked fine
the endgame was a little far fetched  the game was well thought out but the ending wasnt commensurate with the game  it was episodic
aside from the few snafus yes it was fun to play  the health and hev dispenser are somewhat unrealistic  i mean getting health from a dispenser   only in a game  but it was fun
im glad i had an opportunity to play it
and yes i think it helped my motor skillsMy only experience with the game is the solo aspect  From a solo standpoint the game is probably the best shootercrawler ever but to linear for me  I like a more open sandbox type game  HalfLife took an already crounded genre refined and did it better than anybody before or really since  Flawless game play easy and intuitive controls and top notch story line  I think the story was the best part of the game  Despite my personal views this really is a must have for any pc gamer as it really is the top game in its fieldA mustkill for dedicated fans of singleplayer first person shooter  HL takes an utterly unoriginal idea for either games or movies and crafts an utterly unstoppable gaming experience  You play Gordon Freeman who works in the bowels of an ultrasecret underground research facility called The Black Mesa  Having played the game yet Im still not sure whats supposed to be going on in BM  its The Aftermath that matters  Oozing hightech the facility is host to the denizens of another dimension when youFreeman accidentallydo something that tears a whole in the fabric of our own  allowing beings from that other world to enter ours

Now if you think that these otherworldly denizens are peaceful beings intent on fostering crossdimensional love or that your fellow human beings will enter the Black Mesa unarmed intent on warmly welcoming these beings to our world or at least to rescue you  Im afraid youve picked up the wrong game entirely  For in the bowels of Black Mesa youll confront howling dog things flying crabs alienzombified versions of your colleagues gigantic aliens that breathe fire through their fists aliens that hang from ceilings and entrap their victims using these vinelooking things and squads of human special forces troops intent on killing everything that moves  including you  If the above attracts you because you think it may be the setting that elevates the nobility of the human existence I should warn you to look elsewhere  for in Half Life youll find yourself acting indiscriminately with a mm automatic a submachine gun grenades and most regrettably of all a nasty crowbar youll make few friends and find yourself for the most part alone and not infrequently exiled to ventilation ducts again with the ducts to avoid getting shot at by humans or burned bitten bolted or tonguebathed by aliens

Complex problem solving skills as much as marksmanship or bulletsaving are crucial in this game  in which your enemies have aboveaverage levels of AI  There are unfortunately times when a level may be hung up by the failure to achieve some specific missiongoal but this is on the whole a game in which the goals are sufficiently complex to make you feel cool for achieving them yet not so complex as to be impossible to solve  The games settings are fantastic  from the vast to claustrophobic  The game is long  uncommitted gamers may find it tedious  but the scope of design here rewards those who keep up with it

I ran this game on an XPequipped P with a MB AGP card and had no problems other than those involving the evil aliens and homicidal fellow humans  Graphics and sound were smooth and I suffered no CTDs  As with all FPS games The Rotten Review strenuously endorses the Nostromo SpeedpadFinally after YEARS of seeing Mega Man in D shooter sidescroller gameplay Capcom began to realize the video game scene was changing and realism was becoming more important than ever  So in  Capcom decided to take the classic gameplay of the old Mega Man games and bring Mega Man to an ENTIRE new D world  I finally got to experience the D Mega Man adventure a few days ago in July   So it took me NINE years to finally play it  What can I say  Im slow

I have a few problems with certain parts of the game but overall Im happy to report that the jump to D was a good one not to mention a NECESSARY one  Mega Man spends the entire time in Legends jumping and shooting through a unique D environment

Im surprised so many people hate the graphics in the game  Theyre quite wonderful if you ask me  Sure the graphics may be dated because the game is nearly  years old and walking around in Mega Man Legends is sort of like walking around in a giant land of legos but none of that should matter because you have to take into account the amount of FUN a game provides  Mega Man Legends provides a LOT of fun

I really loved one of the very first boss fights in the game where I had to keep running and hiding behind buildings because these giant walking blue red and yellow machines were throwing bombs and shooting laser beams at me  The first time I completed this battle it took a good  minutes ONLY for a bigger badder machine to come in and defeat me in seconds  At first I was angry because the game wouldnt let me SAVE before fighting this fourth boss  A half hour of work flushed down the toilet was the thought that went through my head

That led me to think the game might be too hard for me to handle but it turned out I just didnt have the right upgrades for my Xbuster equipped actually I didnt have ANYTHING equipped so when I went back to do the battle again I defeated him her actually rather easily

Most of the enemies throughout the game are rather easy to defeat including the boss fights  Many of the boss fights will keep you on your toes though  The strategy to defeating many of them is to KEEP RUNNING and only turn around when the moment is right and BLAST them  The only boss who isnt easy is the very last boss who sounds like Michael Jackson because he has TWO forms  The first form you can figure out with practice but on the second form he turns into a giant machine and THEN the challenge increases  But its possible to find enough money to carry up to  Subtanks to help you out DRASTICALLY  If you were to carry  Subtanks he would be a VERY easy boss  Despite that the game provides a nice challenge because the way the story unfolds forces you to do a LOT of things  You have to go HERE you have to go THERE  You have to collect THIS you have to collect THAT  Youll find out just how many items and weapons are in the game when you hit the Start button and see everything in your inventory  Its borderline INSANE

You see to help make the game easier what you have to do is go around searching for things things located in treasure chests or holes in walls and then you have to bring the things you collect back to this yellow vehicle where your female friend or sister I forget who she is will be inside  She can find ways to turn many of the things you collect into important weapons for you to use  She must be smart

I think I explained myself correctly there  Its kind of confusing because theres so many things you have to collect and thats the main reason I cant give the game a perfect star rating  TOO MUCH  In Mega Man Legends you will find SO many weapons and SO many upgrades that it can easily confuse someone like me whos normally not exposed to this much activity in a video game

You have to find a little dancing monkey to save your game  When youre lost he can also help you by telling you where to go unfortunately many times he doesnt provide enough information  So you can be left wandering around for hours until you finally have no choice but to find a strategy guide on the internet to help you out

The music in the game is nice  Its usually played quietly which is odd because most Mega Man music is RIGHT in your face  If you can actually hear the music its pretty much what youd expect from a Mega Man game

Listen to those sound effects  Sound familiar  Think South Park  One of the children or pirates sounds JUST like Butters and a newswoman who appears later in the game sounds like Kyles mom  Some of the animation looks like South Park too  When did South Park come out    Hmmm makes you wonder

Once again the graphics  They arent as bad as I thought theyd be  Sort of blocky of course since this IS Playstation ONE were talking about here but I cant bring myself to really hate the graphics because theres a certain mysterious charm about them  Mega Man Legends LOOKS like a childrens game but its not really  Most children wouldnt be able to complete the game because some boss strategies require careful timing and it would be difficult for a child

The play control goodness  Its definitely not easy to figure out at first  To make Mega Man walk straight you have to hold down the L and R buttons this rotates the direction Mega Man is facing while at the same time you have to use the up down left and right buttons to make Mega Man walk forward  So because you have to do a lot of running in Mega Man Legends when an enemy is chasing you and RIGHT behind you you have to turn around use the L and R buttons to face him and THEN hit him  In the middle of hitting the L and R buttons will probably be the time you take the most hits  It may take a few hours to properly pull off but you should become better at it with practice

A trick to help you when an enemy is chasing you run as far away from him as possible and THEN turn around  Usually the enemy will be far enough away that you will have time to control Mega Man so hes facing the enemy directly  Then simply wait for the enemy to get close and fire away  I wouldnt blame you if you couldnt figure out the controls its not the greatest way to control a character  Im not sure if Capcom improved the play control in Mega Man Legends 

I find it funny and insulting that when you find a hole in a wall many times a very small amount of money will be located there  Small enough to not be able to afford ANYTHING  Its funny because Capcom made it like wow you found money only to insult you with sofa cushion money  To find a LOT of money you have to run around shooting enemies

Just running around shooting enemies and collecting zenny money is a lot of fun not to mention addicting  A pretty good game worth picking upTo me Mega Man Legends is one of those games youll remember years after playing it The game itself doesnt break any new ground and has its share of flaws but the overall experience is definitely rewarding

Mega Man Legends pretty much plays like the earlier Tomb Raider games control wise Unfortunately there are a few problems with the control scheme such as a lock on system that doesnt allow you to move while locked on an enemy which was fixed in MML and the fact you also must contend with moving the camera manually in order to compensate for the lack of a better lock on system to hit your mark

Legends also uses a pretty similar graphic engine as Tomb Raider as well complete with all the flat D scenery that rotates with the camera and all the pixilated surfaces and clipping problems that accompanied that era of Playstation gaming Unlike Tomb Raider the environments in Mega Man Legends are much brighter and colorful adding to the games cartoonlike feel rather than the dark dank deathtrap ridden tombs that Lara Croft raids

The pretty low difficulty level of the game is also an important factor to look at as well Considering this game is somewhat geared towards an younger audience this isnt an error so to speak but older more experienced players will fly through the game in a handful of hours especially considering most of the game bosses can be defeated by constantly circling around them and firing Thankfully Capcom added an unlockable difficulty setting to make the game harder for those looking for an additional challenge oh and is it ever a challenge Add to this Capcom increased the difficulty on Mega Man Legends  a few notches and all can be forgiven here

So with all these problems why is Legends such a good game Heart and lots of it Mix in a good story a wonderful cast of characters and enemies and throw in some of Capcoms more respectable forays in voice acting department and you got a winner While some may claim that Legends carries a kiddy tone I actually find this to be one of the games charms and strengths Honestly if you dont laugh when one of the Lego Men err I mean Servebots messes up and angers Tron there is something wrong Seriously it isnt anymore kiddy than a Mario or Zelda game or most of Nintendos gaming library for that matter

The other thing that makes the Legends series so great is the fact Capcom decided to quit while they were ahead While I myself still wish they would churn out a Mega Man Legends  considering some of the unresolved issues in Mega Man Legends s ending at least Capcom didnt make a zillion sequels and drain the series of all its fun and respectability of which they have done a fine job of doing to the original series and X series

In the end Mega Man Legends is not a game youll remember for amazing graphics razorsharp control or challenging quests Instead youll walk away with a overall memorable experienceIts fun and all but STILL NO COASTER CAM i wonder why but the game is still fun I like the gameplay and i like the fact that it is NOT HARD and the game is not boring Graphics are goooood and not blockey if you are a roller coaster tycoon fan ther is a web site calld roller coaster tycoon  com and you can look at stuff for the game And i like the way you make rides the game makes makeing roller coasters fun and makeing your park fun  So by thes fun and NOT hard game now you will love itWhat can I say about this game It was name PC Gamers game of the year The game is simply great At first glance it seems like your typical first person shooter but once you start getting into the game everything changes It turns into a complete horror game Its one of those games that if you play at night will make you want to turn all the lights in the house on The game gives you huge suprises like little alien creatures jumping out at you from no where Or dark corridors with things waiting to kill you on the other side This game is great and is perfect for anyones collectionRoller Coaster Tycoon is a game that is focusing on building an entertainment park You can build your own themed park rollercoaster gokart track and many more This game is released years ago and now the price has been dropped Being lowpriced doesnt always mean bad games I played this game for months a few years ago It has free mode where you can build your own dream entertainment park Or you can play in mission mode in which you have to meet the requirements for each level

The sounds in this game is pretty good making you feel as if you are in the middle of an entertainment park You can hear the screaming of people on the roller coaster the tune of the MerrygoRound the noise of the crowd and so on

If you have good PCs with great graphic card you may want to try Roller Coaster Tycoon  with D graphics with better gameplay graphics and sounds

Overall this is still a great game and really worthy With only a few bucks you can have another entertainment source in your PC for your weekend For the Ace combat initiated this game is a lot better that the original Ace Combat for its graphics and play although I have to say how much I enjoyed Ace Combat too in the beginning Not only have the grapics been improved but the game now includes a scannar that actually tellls you which way the enemy planes are pointing  a must for the correct deployment of missiles Missions are plentiful and in addition to the possibility to select a wingman or indeed wingwoman as sexual equality aware NAMCO has included you can even direct him or her to take on a certain part of the mission or do the mission without support as you wish There are the usual night missions and canyonruns and plenty of planes to choose from Game action is very smooth too The planes available in the more advanced stages of the missions are great An enjoyable gameThis is a very good game I used to play this game for hours on end Its a lot of fun The best part about it is that you dont need to have a supercomputer to play it For those of you whos computers cant handle RCT  buy this game Do Not get RCT  its not worth the money to buy a slightly worse carbon copy of a great gameEver wanted to be a scientist but never had the aptitude for it Ever wanted to join the Army or the Marines but couldnt because you were flatfooted Well you can rejoice now because HalfLife will solve both those problems with one blow You start off as an intelligent scientist named Gordon Freeman You work at a place called Black Mesa which is like Area  After an informative trainride you get off have some chitchat with the guards and get your suit I was very impressed with how professional the level looked Security guards retina scanners the works This aint your local bank After getting your suit you go to a room where an experiment is about to take place Youre a crucial part of it But wait the scientists are sounding as if something might go wrong And then you push the specimen into the beam and    and shortly after that youll be experiencing one of the finest moments in video game history Remember that nicelooking level I was telling you about Now visualize it with HEAVY damage dead or dying scientists and guards and aliens popping out of thin air AND YOU HAVE NO WEAPON This is no Quake cakewalk with John Wayne heroics Youll be CRAWLING in FEAR for most of the game  I think one of the main things that made this game popular was this It touched on the common fear of going into the unknown and feeling illprepared for what lies ahead Sure you might have  rounds on the MP a rocket launcher and whatever else but believe me it wont last long especially on hard mode  Another thing that this game touched on was this The fear of small spiderycreatures and large ugly TRex things that can run faster than you Believe me when I say youll jump when you stick your head in a tunnel and a snark or headcrab jumps out at you After a while you manage to arm yourself and try and make it to the surface    only to find that Marines are attacking Black Mesa in an effort to cover up the severe accident So now we have this ugly Bermuda Triangle of Marines Aliens and You The Aliens are just plain bad  Youre just trying to get your innocent rearend out of there And the Marines are just following orders Makes for one whopper of a story and a game  But not all is runandgun MANY times youll be jumping like Mario making welltimed decisions and solving puzzles But besides all that there are three other things about this game that I like A flashlight Its ABOUT TIME someone did something to light those dark levels Humor Guards goof around with experimental technologywith disastrous results Welllighted levels overall The only FPS Ive seen with more light is Serious Sam Very rarely will you be squinting your eyes in this game  To wrap things up my favorite levels are the beginning one and the one entitled Surface Tension Despite some wonderful level design in this game I really hated the alien levels Sure they LOOKED nice but when you start playing them its a different story Also the two endings are too short and unsatisfactory But overall this is a GREAT game worth getting even now especially if you havent played it before despite the fact that Return to Castle Wolfenstein and other FPSs are around the cornerThis game is will go great with the add ons But i love this game with Gordon and all the other civilians and scientists and security But this game has very cool weapons and very cool monsters But this game is not reccomended for young users because of major violence and gore And Multiplayer is a blast BUT DONT EVER GIVE AWAY YOUR CD KEY IF YOU DO YOU MAY NEVER PLAY HALF LIFE MULTIPLAYER AGIAN Dont even copy the cd for your friends But this game has everything i expected with excellent graphics Everyone will enjoy this game im sure But  stars is my rating because i cant give anything  stars unless its AWESOME AND HAS NOTHING WRONGMy first Ace combat game was Electrosphere or number  in  so  years later i decided to give this one a go  Its a lot of fun and after you configure your controls to how you like it becomes even better  Compared to  this one is a bit more fast paced but the graphics are noticeably lower in quality

The one quarrel I have though it is a given for all pre ish i think PlayStation games is you cant use the analog sticks which i always used in the third AC and even though its just a little stick not having it really takes away from the flying feelIn todays game market its easy to miss racing games that arent part of the licenseheavy Forza or Gran Turismo franchises Dirt  for PC is in an even worse boat than most since its been a giveaway for a couple years now with every DX compliant ATI video card As a result a lot of people who get it send it straight to eBay and most people who do play it have not bought it new

This is a shame because Dirt  is a fun little game Theres a great assortment of multinational tracks and a wide array of classic and modern rally cars to choose from As a rally game Dirt  ditches the comfortable confines of tracks and sends you headlong across snow and gravel in a world where keeping control of your car is a greater skill than making it around the turns Dirt  wears a veneer of noisy fun arcadestyle game play but under the hood it calls for quick reactions a good understanding of road surfaces and nerves of steel Sadly it also calls for a gamepad or wheel you will almost certainly find the keyboard too allornothing for serious racing

PROS
Visually stunning engine that makes full use of DirectX  effects
Soundtrack is an appealing mix of classic prog rock and modern music that does a good job of being vaguely European and not too intrusive
Successfully models an arcadelike complexity of play with a surprisingly deep simulation of track conditions and vehicle handling
Incar camera gives a stomachchurning stream of nonstop thrills as you launch over crests and wheel hairpins
Probably the most realistic depiction of driftingpowersliding to appear in a video game its frightening nauseating and usually a bad idea
D support

CONS
Lower difficulties arent much fun highest difficulty is brutally hard
Small fanbase of hardcore racing nuts may make multiplayer a bit hard for newcomers Dirt  players seem pretty nice though
Essentially requires some sort of analog input
May confuse players who arent familiar with the rules and conditions of rallystyle racing

Other thoughts
You need to plug your youtube credentials into the game to let it export your highlights to YouTube I dont think CodeMasters wants to rip you off but if it makes you uncomfortable create a new Google identity for use with Dirt  Easy
LEARN THE TRACKS Learn the tracks learn the tracks learn the tracks
If you want to win employ a FinHalfLife is a first person shooter in the same vein as Doom and Quake  What sets HalfLife apart though is the more detailed backrounds and more realistic gameplay  In Quake you blast everything to pieces and plow your way through the levels  In HalfLife you pretty much do the same thing except the backrounds and characters are more interactiveit almost seems like its part role playing game The graphics rival those seen on Quake and Unreal and the story has more backbone also Overall HalfLife provides more of a realistic environment to explore and destroy than most other games of its kind  If you cant get enough of first person shooters HalfLife is a great choice for some more actionOk  just like everyone sez this IS one of the best games ever made and you SHOULD buy it immediately  But it does have some flaws
 First of all a lot of the weopons in this game i dont like There is only one machine gun only one shotgun one pistol  etc  Cmon wheres the variety
Second the Team Fortress add on that comes with this game really sucks It is no where near as good as counterstrike
Anyways  Buy Half Life and download Counterstrike for free of the netI have to say that even a long time after its release this game still keeps me entertained The graphics are great the atmosphere is amazing the AI is incredible Altogether one excellent game There are loads of different puzzles and there isnt any faffing around with end of level bosses
There are few downpoints though even in a game of this standard The direct x graphics mode is terrible and the open GL is not compatible with my card even though open GL works fine with my card in other games More general pitfalls are that it takes time to get going  theres no way to skip the intro which isnt that relevant to whats going on anyway The first few levels provide little entertainment  of the way through you get thrown into some alien planet which almost stops the game dead It sometimes feels a bit linear as well
However enough moans coz the good outwieghs the bad by a long shot This contains all the elements that SiN shouldve hadThis is a good game and my  year old son loves to play it  This game can be installed on a PC running Windows XP Home Edition and will run fine but you can get better performance if you use the Windows Compatibility WizardBoy this is a tough one to write about How can I fairly review a game  that has resided on my hard drive since the very day it was released For  the technical minded HalfLife HL is based on a modified Quake   engine but the modifications simply blow Quake away in almost every  aspect Valve made an excellent move with this choice It is well known in  the gaming community that Quakes engine has some of the most stable  networking code in the business Too bad the video compatibility is a  little odd For the gamer at heart this game may have a    half life  longer than Quake itself Valve made a good move allowing the gaming  community to have the WorldCraft level editor and other SDK software What  this means to the average player is that a simple jaunt to a good web page  will yield every manner of new levels characters and baddies to download  and install to their hearts content And with Valves Opfor expansion  pack this game will take up a large amount of space on a lot of hooked  players computers
One of the most notable modifications to Half Life is  the apparently intelligent enemies Shoot the dogs and theyll  run for cover and regroup with their pals Let the marines see or hear you  and theyll drop a hand grenade on your head Ninjas dont just run into  you they jump over your head and land behind you Crabs pop up at the most  inconvenient times A well designed level and a poorly designed level is  differentiated by the intelligence of the enemies Although the  modifications are great they are certainly predictable to an extent Play  the game enough and youll eventually spot patterns to the enemies  thinking
So of course after defeating the game forward and  backwards it would be time to test the Quake engine network code Needless  to say a k modem is NOT recommended Even though with my experience the  network game play is better than the Unreal engine the modem does this  game sad justice Hopping up to anything better than a k modem really  makes this game shine Valve has multiplayer levels packed right in with  this game nice big areas with lots of weapons make this game a fun  fragfest The levels dont have that disgusting  dark feel to them Underground levels have suitable colors and  lighting Out door levels have an expansive feeling although no where near  the out door feeling that Unreal does so well Too bad that  HL has compatibility problems with various video cards
Its really not  so much compatibility problems its really more that valves default  settings for the are usually not the correct settings The voodoo video  family suffers the worst from this By default the video gamma is far too  bright for the voodoo  card The decals have the incorrect value Lighting  dont appear correctly And SLI seems to have an odd effect on the game  Most cards have their unique set of problems and all of these adjustments  have to be done at the command level Not something to be done by the  average gamer
And this game screams to be played by all gamers With  many advanced gamers using the enclosed Software Developers Kit SDK and  WorldCraft to make new levels and in some cases completely new games  Valve guaranteed HLs place in the gaming community Even if the average  player has no idea how to use the software to create new levels they can  still go to numerous web sites and download any number of home made levels  The  Opposing Force expansion pack and the upcoming Gunman game are direct  descendants of users and their Valves SDK That are purchasable in the  store while hot downloads like They Hunger and DSS Darkstar add free  life to the game
This leads up to the final gripe with HL though not a  major one I have the Team Fortress Classic TFC expansion the Opposing  Force pack and numerous user made levels and my directory  continues to grow Currently the space taken by HL and the various packs  levels and extras has reached  MB of space In contrast Diablo  Full  installation is  GB while Diablo  is only  MB The games are  growing guys and gals so the PC requirements should be followed like a  bible
All in all I would have given more than five stars if the system  would have allowed me to do so But I admit I had to take at least one star  away I did this to force a point onto most people who wish to own a copy  of HL The game can be played right of the box but to get the full effect  of the game youre going to need to edit the auto start and configuration  files Voodoo  owners used to have the HL Voodoo Doctor but alas I have  not seen his web page in months HL really does not like the Voodoo card  ATI Rage Fury does a little better but youll get a bizarre  ghost on occasion The TNT family does the best out of the  bunch with the default values I understand Valve is working on this issue  in HL  TFC   but well have to wait and see Congrats Valve this  game shoved Quake Quake  Unreal and Duke Nukem D permanently off of my  drive Ive since gotten a dual  GB drive configuration  GB total  Ive never even bothered to dust off those games With the purchase of  Bungee software by Microsoft Please God Dont let Halo and Oni be XBox  only games  the MultiPlayer nature of Quake  and Duke Nukem with the  Unreal engine on a perpetual release date HL will be a tough game to  knock off the Game of the Year throne Has HL cursed the first  person shooter genre Are developers afraid to knock the king out of the  ring It may look that wayThis game is great  It has the same basis as Sim City only you control all aspects of an amusement park  You are given objectives for each level that you must complete in order to unlock more levels  Once you have completed all the levels you gain the right to build your own amusement park with no restrictions  The best part of this game is the fact that you build the rides individually  You can create your version of the best roller coaster ever and see if the guests like it as much as you do  This game does get repetitive after a while though as every Sim City type game doesI am normally not a real big fan of sim type games so I waited a while to buy this one  I didnt like it all that much at first but after picking it up I really got to like it  This game is very precise and fairly realistic which makes it hard to learn but also a lot of fun to play once you have
The animation and sound in this game are spectacular  You build all sorts of amusement park attractions for your guests and then you watch them walk around your park like little ants  All of the sounds of a theme park are there  The clicketyclack of the roller coaster chains the screams of the riders as the coaster plunges down the hill and the laughs of the children and yes  The programmers even included the cheesy music that they play for the bumper cars
Anything that moves can be clicked on and examined  The level of precision and the amount of choices that you have in this game are fantastic and sometimes overwhelming  The game consists of twentysome scenarios that gradually get harder  Each time that you finish one you get a new challenge which keeps the game from getting too easy as you become more proficient
The roller coasters have realistic physics  This is both good and bad  The good part  if you are a roller coaster enthusiast then you will love being able to design a working coaster  You control everything from the height of the first drop to the colors of the trains  The bad part  designing even a mediocre coaster can get very tedious and expensive  One big coaster will chew up all of your cash and if you are playing a short scenario you probably wont be able to build another one  In addition coasters take up a lot of space and because of this your park usually runs out of it  I have played almost all of the scenarios and I have never really gotten to build the ultimate megacoaster
The one aspect of this game that I found to be annoying was the tendency of kids to get sick from your rides  This aspect of the game was BADLY overdone maybe the writers thought it was supposed to be cute  Even if they dont get sick a lot of them will be afraid to ride it  The park customers are total wimps  You can build a foot tall standup roller coaster with  inversions and nobody will ride it because it is too intense whatever that means  The rollercoaster physics might be realistic but the customer behavior definitely is not  This is one of a few examples of questionable AI in this game  Still as a rollercoaster enthusiast I thoroughly enjoyed this gameThis is a great game and remake of the original Theme Park made in the early s   It is so addicting and time consuming so make sure youve got plenty of time to waste before you sit down to play  Its definitely a great game although the graphics arent quite up to snuff with todays technology but you get over that  It definitely has challenges too so dont think you can just breeze through the scenarios  A definite buy for your family gamerworks well for me except i cant get my championships to show at the end Im not sure if that is a glitch or notThis game is very very good because it has the reallife thinking it runs on slow computers like mine it doesnt that that much space up and its fun too The only probalm with this game is the money there isnt any freeforall levels which makes it lessaddidive there are lots of things to do completing parks takes too long and too hard though The money
There is hunger Thirst Happyness Nausa and Bathroom I like to rise the money for bathroom a lot so people after it hits really high they have to go The downside to this game is even if you make a great park if your people have to pay everytime they go on a ride they get broke and leave or get mad trying to find there way out This happened to me so just make park enternce  dollars and everything free even food What my nd favorite thing to do in the game is make roller costers that stack on each other you can make a roller by just ONE land by Rising the land first not too high though then get a roller coster picked the put the first roller coster path on the high land you made and build on You can make lots of stuff in a small area Graphics ok this is good but nothing like what today is plus people can get stuck on Water Rides for no reasons and it isnt perceft on making a good life like roller coster because parts show on and off Graphics Fun this game is the MOST addidive game ever Fun Gameplay this can last you like  hours Gameplay Sound this is a bad thing in the game like only the sound of kids and roller costers needs SOUND Overall this game is great if you like fun games get this which is Great and  stars goes to Roller Coster TycoonI have played this game for  years now Its great and addictive and is very different from what I have played before It draws you in as the scenarios get tougher and your will to beat them skyrockets The gameplay is good but can lag and the time in the game moves slow I feel its a good game to play if your bored and you should buy it and try it yourself Beware its addictiveWhile the game may be outdated and not as fun to play as some of the more recent titles I cant fault this game because this is where it all started

On its own merit in  it was a smashbox hit and everybody was ahhed by the graphics d environments and the musical score Back then we were used to Super Mario World and Final Fight This was something completely different No one cared about the flaws the game had back then It was par for the course

Now in  a whole  years later really that long ago a person can easily recognize the flaws of gameplay sound and playability Sound effects are lofi almost like comparing a cassette to a CD The soundtrack is still amazing though as if it were mapped on an entirely different bit format Playability there is one overall mode  the P Arcade mode unless you count options and P Every successful completion of the game with a character unlocks a new character to choose  the same one you fight in round  After that you have all of the characters and theres not much else to do Theres no team battle no survival justP Arcade So it works for  The ending movies are pretty bad all having the same soundtrack and really blocky ugly CGI Of course in retrospect this WAS 

The movies never got better in the series until much later but they did improve some

Overall Tekken deserves a place in your PSX collection right next to  and  You wont play it often because Tekken  covers all of those bases and more So to me at least this game is merely a collection pieceI play on Windows  so Ive noticed some color problems in the start up and menu screens  However once I start playing it seems to work just fine  As for game play lots has been written about that  I just wanted to mention that it does work on Win  systems  Also my games save just fineA game that is addictive and easy to play but hard to conquer  A game for the agesI wasnt quite sure what to expect when I picked this game up At first I was struck as to how much it resembles WARCRAFT ORCS VS HUMANS Most of the level advancing character animation and general game play is almost identical At then end of the day the purpose is to beat your enemy by advancing through civilizations and either conquering them retrieving artifacts or constructing a wonder The game is addictive especially at the higher levels If you can try the multiplayer versions Theres nothing quite like playing against someone else There are a few annoying little things You can lose your people behind buildings and in some cases they get lost if sent on a roundabout route to their destinations However still a fun game and highly recommendedI bought Rollercoaster Tycoon a long time ago This game is pretty exciting for anyone who dreams of running their own theme park You can build from over  different rollercoaster plus you can build your own race tracks and alot of other exciting rides But the fun doesnt end there You have to put up food stands bathrooms trash cans shops and some nice scenery to keep your guests happy You have to build thrilling Rollercoasters for the intense guests but if you build a Rollercoaster that has too much intensity nobody will ride it Thats the challenging part of the game But not all people like Rollercoasters A lot of people prefer gentler rides such as Go Karts or the MerryGoRound You can also hire Entertainers to help keep your guests happy When your guests are complaining about how long your line is just pop in an Entertainer right there and it will cheer up the guests and in no time theyll be on the ride You also must hire Mechanics Guards and Custodians to clean up the park and take out the trash If you dont build good rides and dont have enough scenery and shops then your guests will be unhappy and destroy your benches and trash cansthen you gotta replace them You can help stop vandalism by hiring a few Guards that patrol the park So those are just the main reasons why I like this game You can build about jsut anything you can imagine So why did I give this game  stars Well because this game gets very boring after a while Im into multiplayer games like Quake  Arena or StarCraft But whenever I come home from a theme park I wish I still had this game I may even buy it again Trust me this game is a hit for all you people who like to be the bossWell i bought it because i wanted to collect all the tekken gamesi did D and it brings back alot of memoriesI lost track of my original version but have enjoyed having this one installed to play  Yes its not up to todays graphics or story lines but it has been fun to go back in time and play this gameROLLER COASTER TYCOON is a prime example that gameplay will get you a lot longer than shiny graphics ever will The game may be technically infirior to THEME PARK but RCT makes up for this with a much more addictive gameplay In short RCT is probably the most fun youll ever have running a theme park on your PCIve enjoyed StarCraft ever since it came out I loved it and even to this day I enjoy playing it StarCraft is just one of those games that Ive continued playing over the years It has everything a great game needs good graphics and sounds compelling story welldeveloped characters and balanced interesting units If youre interested in getting StarCraft  but have never played this do yourself a favor skip out on StarCraft  and buy this instead

For the most part I play StarCraft for the single player campaign Not only is it fun but the characters actually make you care about them For me the characters are the most compelling aspect of the single player campaign

Gameplaywise I cant really say that StarCraft is much of an innovator Nevertheless the three races are well balanced and packed with interesting units There are only two resources but the resources themselves actually managed to be fairly interesting to me for a while The single player campaign has well over  missions with StarCraft and BroodWar combined There are also a few cutscenes for each race

The voice acting is fantastic The characters end up being well developed and like I said before they make you care about them The voice actors really made their characters come to life The unit sounds are also very well done and are fairly distinct

As far as video game plots go StarCrafts is pretty good Theres nothing really amazing in there but it still manages to be interesting

The graphics are pretty good they bring the dark gritty universe of StarCraft to life

Good as it is StarCraft still has its share of problems For starters you can only select  units at a time This ends up being fairly irritating as more often then not the player will have a large force but will be unable to select all his or her units which can be a pain if youre in the middle of a large battle The unit pathing isnt that great either The units in StarCraft cant take care of themselves very well Total Annihilations pathing is quite a lot better and you can select more then  units at a time

Those two problems are my only real gripes with StarCraft The units are interesting the characters and voiceacting are fantastic and the three races are very wellbalanced Theres a reason that StarCraft is one of the most celebrated RTS games of all time essentially everything about it is almost pure excellence aside from a few issuesThe first time I played this game I was amazed by the sheer quality coming out of this game The grahics were absolutly incredible and the gameplay was out of this world This was all in  Now that tekken and tekken had arrived on the scene it seemed as though tekken had faded to a fairyland Back then in junior school everyone was in conversation about all the characters and the secret ones and how you unlocked them And know that games like tekken tekken and soulbade coming to the playstation tekken was suddenly never an issue All I know is that tekken was a fantastic game at launch and had also beaten virtua fighter on the saturn which was a rival to tekken If tekken had never come out then I believe with a  that none of the existing games that I have mentioned above and their sequals would have been in existance Despite these games being in existance tekken is still a soulfighter and is the game that made namco famous on the playstationI like this game a lot
Is RTS in its most pure state
Build your economy set your army go to seek  destroy
No crappy heroes to level up

It runs ok in my old video card a nvidia 
but show some graphics issues in my new nvidia GTX
in the menu screens but in the gameplay the graphics issues are gone
So I have to deal with the graphics issues only in the menu screens

After playing the StarCraft  beta I can assure that Starcraft 
is better than StarCraft  Not just for the LAN support that
Blizzard remove in SC the gameplay in SC is awesome

Yeah SC has better graphics than SC right but a game
is about gameplay and not graphics

Me and my friends still play SC in LANfests
This is something were going to miss in SCAfter defeating Xenogears I was looking for a game that was fun to play and didnt require me to do much thinking Xenogears was a monster game that had a fantastic yet confusing plot that really made you think Breath of Fire  is a complete change of pace Instead of going for an engrossing and confusing plot like FF and Xenogears Breath of Fire  continues a simple but fun plot that feels refreshing to play after finishing a monster game like Xenogears
Breath of Fire  doesnt have an overly confusing story Once long ago there was a clan on earth known as the dragon clan After gaining enough power to destroy the world the dragon clan suddenly disappeared You play as Ryu a young boy who suffers from amnesia He soon befriends two thieves named Rei and Teepo After he gets into trouble with the authorities he soon finds out he is an ancestor of the dragon clan So he embarks on a journey to uncover his mysterious past
Sound original Sorry but if its originality that you want you wont find it here Even the battle system is painfully unoriginal As you play it it will feel like you have played something else exactly like it The story the battle system everything feels like it was used many times before and i hate to say this but the ending is very disappointing
However with all gripes aside Breath of Fire  is a fun and engaging quest My favorite part of the game was the characters they are interesting and very funny I also liked that the plot never once got confusing Even though it was unoriginal it never got off target and it even sometimes kept you on the edge of your seat
With all the complaints aside Breath of Fire  is fun game to play through After playing through a monster game like Xenogears it is refreshing to play Unfortunately dont get too excited about the endingThis is a retro game  no way around it

However I actually enjoy retro games  I actually just got done playing Another World and Fallout    on my laptop

Having been playing alot of Desktop Tower Defense games lately I thought I would upgrade to a true RTS game  Starcraft kept coming up high on everyones favorite list so I thought Id give it a try

The Good
 This really is a fun game  Im only on level  out of  on the original but its fun  Level  took me about  hrs to finally beat  But some of this is because theres no instructions in the game see The Bad  After reading the strategy guide for the level I finally figured out what I needed to do  However I had fun playing the whole time without getting discouraged
 The graphics arent all that bad  I was expecting much worse  Though theyre not bad theyre not great either  About the same as Fallout   I am surprised they havent been improved by a patch
 No EasyMediumHard setting  I actually prefer to NOT have an EasyMediumHard setting  On some games my first instinct is to pick Medium but then I will often get stuck or find its too easy  And then I wish I had picked something different  This game you have to really be strategic  Some levels may be too easy and some may be pretty darn hard  If theyre hard simply refer to the guide  Which brings up another point  you dont have to keep playing a level until you demolish the CPU  You just need to win  I tried out Middle Earth RTS and your people carry over  I got a few levels in and couldnt beat the level  After hitting a forum I found out its impossible to win if you didnt max out your army from the previous levels

The Bad
  Video  I run this on my laptop and the screen turns black and the game starts in the upper left part of the window consuming only about  of my widescreen laptop  The rest of the screen is black  Its pefectly playable but awefully small  However I noticed that when I put my laptop in my docking station connected to an external monitor it goes fullscreen  Of course fullscreen on a  widescreen monitor is not good for this game either  No amount of tweaking to the shortcut seemed to help  The only option is to change the desktop resolution to x before starting the game which is a major pain  Some Googling and it seems most everyone with a widescreen laptop experiences this  They all refer to a freeware download that lets you run Starcraft in a window  This actually works VERY nice and was surprised at how much I liked it compared to the smaller screen in the upper left  However theres comments from some users that after using the program some people have been banned from Battle Net since it saw they were using a rd party program with Starcraft  Im not interested in playing SC on Battlenet so thats not a huge deal for me  But really if youre going to actively sell a game at the game shops you would think this would be fixed by Blizzard  Its one thing if I found this at a useddiscount store but I didnt  Also Im surprised Blizzard hasnt released a patch to smooth out the graphics a bit  Its not horrible but its hard to imagine that it would be too hard to fix it up a little better with a patch  Many other games have patches that improve the graphics  Doom Quake to name a couple
 No instructions  Really  No instructions  The strategy guide helps and the first levels help give you a feel for the game but really  No instructions  This is part of what hurt me on level   I wanted to beat it without having to read the strategy guide  In the end the guide told me what units I should have before I attack and some of them I had never used let alone knew HOW to use

End rating   stars  Im having fun and thats what counts for a retro game  Minus  star since I have to use rd party freeware to get it to run in a window or proportioned correctly on my laptopThis is a very cool game that has infinite replayability One cool feature that this has is you can click one any person in your park and can see their status if they like your park and where they have been The best part in this game is obvious you get to build your own amusement park For people who love roller coasters you must get this game The Short Version Graphics  Sound  Control Fun Factor  Total This game wasnt very challenging but fun nevertheless  The idea is to build a roller coaster park which may also include thrill rides gentle rides and water rides  The people whom you can see in your park even as you build roam your park  You can spy on each ones thoughts  You need to keep them from getting thirsty or hungry and provide bathrooms  You need to make sure they dont vomit often and clean it up when they do  You can build any roller coaster yourself or choose from preset designs  Building roller coasters is a bit of a challenge since it can be hard to connect the end to the beginning but they can fit the given space more easily than preset ones  Its important to balance your budget and keep track of prices  This game is easy to win but takes a long time to play  I recommend this for anyone who wants a laid back simulation and for people who want to build the ultimate roller coasterThis is the first Gabriel Knight game that Ive played and Im definitely looking forward to playing more games in the series GKIII Blood of the Sacred Blood of the Damned had its moments of brilliance
The characters were well developed with distinct personalities The voice acting however ranged from decent to shameonyou bad Case in point Tim Curry as Gabe Knight His accent seemed to shift wildly from Southern tosomething unidentified Hall of shame nominee Scottish thugs proclaiming Were Scots God help ye
The graphics were generally detailed but pixellated D models had a tendency to cut in and out of the screen
There were plenty of places to explore in the chateau museum church and town of RennesleChateau and in the surrounding countryside The puzzles were often difficult and I frequently found myself backtracking for missed items Also there is a lot of downtime in some of the timeblocks so I found myself wandering around for a while trying to kill time
The storyline was genuinely unlike anything Ive ever played before Although the initial premise is that of a vampire cult kidnapping a child the ending drastically reinvented the story of Jesus which is sure to offend many I still dont understand half of the cutscenes and ending months after playing it
There was a lot of dialogue to sort through and many locations that I had to backtrack through so this game kept me busy for quite a long time GKIII is not for everyones tastes hence the M rating It deals with vampirism and a reinvention of the death of Jesus It was definitely thought provoking and entertaining and if youre a fan of mystery and the supernatural then Blood of the Sacred Blood of the Damned is worth a lookI finally got around to playing the entire Gabriel Knight series For the rest of you who havent youre missing out These are positively the best rd person adventure games ever made
Its hard to review GK on its own merits without comparing it to GK and GK First off going directly from GK to GK was a shock as the former is done entirely in FMV and the latter used d CG technology When GK was made this was fairly new and not as polished as it is today The environments are well done but I had a hard time with the characters They didnt look quite right and a lot of their movements were stylized and unrealistic I got used to this as the game progressed However I still find that I relate better to D characters as in The Longest Journey or GK than I do to D representations that are trying so hard to be human and not quite making it
The script and voice acting were often not quite what I had come to expect I particularly was not fond of Tim Currys portrayal of the title character a fact which struck me as odd as I loved his work as Gabriel in GK But in GK I thought he had a little too much tendancy to go over the top particularly with Gabriels wisecracks which sometimes seemed more suited to Beavis and Butthead Gabriel as a character grows and changes a lot over the course of the games and I dont think Currys portrayal was true to that fact I was also puzzled and irritated at Gabriels sudden inability to pronounce French He had a beautiful accent when French terms came up in GK what happened to it Whether this was due to the actor or the director it was a poor choice and it bothered me
However Gabriel Knight  is still a great game Like the others in the series it is quite long and takes a lot of thought and a lot of close attention to detail I liked that the NPCs had lives of their own and moved through the game in ways that were unpredictable By keeping close track of them sometimes stumbling on interactions and conversations you can get a much larger picture of whats going on I thought this added a lot to the realism of the game You dont have to see everything to complete the game but attempting to do so both makes the game last longer and makes it very replayable
Every Gabriel Knight game pushes the limits of the genre by utilizing special interfaces In Gabriel Knight  the special interface is a computer within the game In addition to being vital to solving one of the main puzzles this internal computer offers a wealth of information on a variety of subjects You can spend hours just searching the database and reading the entires I thought this was very cool
The puzzles in GK are generally a mix of standard inventorybased timed activity and arcade  Often you have to wander around a lot to figure out what you need to do next  One particular puzzle stands out as one of the best thoughtout and most complex puzzles Ive ever come across in gaming  In it you must solve a riddle by analyzing and linking various inventory items  Its a very long puzzle and some people might find it frustrating but it was the thing that really caught and held my interest If all I have to do is talk to people and find inventory items I dont feel like Ive really done anything Theres plenty of that in GK but you also have to stretch your brain
I really enjoyed John DeLancies performance as the villain I also enjoyed the depth of interaction between the main characters and I am very impressed with the amount of research into esoterica that Jane Jensen put into this and the other games in the series If you are at all of a mystic bent or have any interest in what might be termed the occult you will like this game
You can play GK without playing the other games in the series but I think it wouldnt be as enjoyable as the background information gives so much insight into the characters and their relationships Still if youre looking for a great story and challenging puzzles dont pass up Gabriel Knight I had seen this game sitting on the shelves of software stores for months  When the price finally lowered I decided to buy it  It was well worth my money  The game is absolutely stunning
The first thing to note is the graphics  The textures arent really that detailed but that doesnt stop them from preforming  The scenery is absolutely beautiful  Playing the game makes me want to visit Rennes le Chateau for real
The next good thing is the soundtrack  It is perfect  Every scene has a unique track  Sometimes I have the character just stand around doing nothing so I can enjoy the music
Lastly the story is fabulous  It has some great supernatural influence as well as classic detective work
I take away one star because some of the puzzles can be ridiculously difficult expecially if you dont understand what youre supposed to be doing but dont let that stop you  If you really need to you can always find a walkthruI have to admit that my copy of Gabriel Knight  sat on my shelf for over a year before I felt like playing it all the way through  This was because I did not like the D graphics this time around after all some of the movies on Gabriel Knight  were superb and you just cant get that with D  I still dont like the D graphics but once I started playing this game seriously I was hooked again  The historical background stuff is always fascinating to me and any game in which a tube of Preparation H plays a part is always going to impress me  I hate to think what sort of individual could play this game without resorting to hints and cheats although they would have to be somebody with a lot more time on their hands than I am  There is always some point where I need some help finding out what I missed out on that prevents me from advancing to the next time block I didnt pick up the glass in the hallway and now I cant listen in on conversations going on in the rooms  Sigh  I like Tim Curry as much as the next person but it doesnt sound like him so his return is not a big deal for me I liked the guy in GK  Whats more important here is the wry sense of humor Cant get somebody to talk  Try the gun icon see what happens  I have to assume most people who play Blood of the Sacred Blood of the Damned come to the game through one if not both of the first two Gabriel Knight adventures  In that case I certainly do not think you will be more than mildly disappointed with episode 
I hear than this particular type of computer game the Gabriel KnightPhantasmagoria type is on its way out because it takes too long to put together and does not sell as well as the bloodier arcade type games  That is not good news because these are the only type I play  After I finish Im going to have to go back and play again and try out some of the variations  Note It can be very useful to save the game at different points and go back and do some variations  Getting caught snooping around can be also be fun  Bottom Line For most of Gabriel Knight  with its Wagner and Werewolves has been the highpoint of the series to date  But I am more than willing to give anything Jane Jensen wants to do a tryThis game is one of the best out there You dont need a supercomputer In fact this is one game where the requierments will let it run just fine Pros very addictive fun realistic low requierments Cons very easy time consumingthere are time limits but you need to wait until the time expiersvery annoying Overall this game is well worth the money expesaly if you buy loopy landscapes the expainsionThe third in the mysterysolving series GKIII not only improves on the series but on the genre itself
For those who enjoy games that involve more thinking and amazing storylines this game is definate buy It was the first Gabriel Knight game I had ever played and when I was finished I wanted more The plot alone is so deep and enriching that youll want to play just to see what happens next
My only problem involved the difficulty of some of the puzzles Its not that they were too hard but that they seemed a little ridiculous Some seemed to beg for the purchase of a walkthrough and I admit I did some walkthrough searches on the net but it was worth it to see the ending
I thought the graphics were great especially the detailed scenery which is an almost exact duplicate of the real French town of RennesLesChateau One of the high points in the game was Robert Holmes soundtrack which relied mostly on creepy atmospheric piano pieces It really added to the experiance
Anyone who enjoys puzzlebased suspense games should give this one a try  its more than worth itGabriel Knight  GK is a challenging and entertaining game that is both aesthetically and technically pleasing proving to be an all round triumph by game designer Jane Jenson and Sierra Studios The player is immersed in a compelling convoluted murdermystery in a remote French village gets to play as two characters and gradually unravels a complicated web of mysteries suspects and the key ingredient vampires The aforementioned aspects of GK make this hour  CD extravaganza a true delight to play however one may find that the plot is a little too complicated which proves detrimental to the pace of the game
  The player assumes the roles of Gabriel Knight and Grace Nakimura both private investigators in a small village called RennesLeChateau The village is steeped in history due it being the suspected locality of the Holy Grail Gabriel has been assigned a mission by Prince James a wealthy businessman whose son had been kidnapped whilst in the vicinity of the area As Gabriel gradually uncovers more about the mystery of the kidnapped child he concomitantly delves into a turbulent violent world of treasure hunting vampires religion riddles shady characters and murder It is a real pleasure to witness this fantastic story unfold despite it being rather slow in unraveling
  The marvelous although slow moving plot is incorporated into a fully interactive D environment which the player is able to investigate thoroughly due to a camera that is able to be manipulated The player can move the camera around much like the camera in a st person shooter allowing investigation of intricate spots such as under a desk or inside a dumb waiter shaft What makes this localeinvestigation so delightful is that each of the environments looks absolutely gorgeous barring the occasional obviously D tree or clearly polygonal hill
  The sound is pretty good the characters can eavesdrop on conversations and engage in conversations with striking clarity to name but a few features Although the voices come out crystal clear the actual sound of the voices is quite terrible Tim Curry of Rocky Horror fame is the voice of Gabriel Knight and his feigned southern drawl quickly becomes irritating Graces voice is average as are some of the other characters and the script can sometimes be quite terrible None of the characters despite how lifethreatening the predicament seem to realise just how endangered they are Gabriel even goes so far as to wisecrack when a razorsharp pendulum is about to chop his head off
  But despite the minor problems with voices or a rather sluggish plot GKs good points far outweigh the bad It is full of challenging problems and provides hours of great fun and excitement which is exactly what a game should do GK amalgamates innovation with traditional murdermystery storytelling so if youre looking for an adventure game triumph then look no further than Gabriel Knight  its a real winnerAll of the reviews Ive read seem to come from longtime players of this game rather then new players who actually bought the Battlechest One of the first things you need to know about this addition that there is NO MANUAL I was pretty surprised to discover this But wait you say there are two official strategy guides Yes there are But they wont teach you how to play the game They dont include basic stats on all of the units they dont include all short cut commands they dont include technology trees they dont explain the concept of real time strategy games They offers hints observations and walk throughs of all of the missions which are handy but not a substitute for a manual The only help the game itself offers is a list of some of the keyboard short cuts hints and one training mission which will be of little use unless you are familiar with real time strategy games
Ive recently discovered and fallen in love with real time strategy games and having recently begun playing Age of the Empires II and Empire Earth I found the basic concepts similar and could figure you out in general what I was supposed to do But I found myself struggling to understand the specifics of the game and how to best use the units to win the missions with such incomplete information Fortunately at battlenetcom the official StarCraft website I discovered extensive documentation Still its hardly as convenient as having a manual to refer to while playing
Armed with a link to the battlenet documentation I have played through half of the Terran Missions and have found them to be very entertaining The missions are varied and gradually introduce you to new units and concepts Hints are offered along the way So far that are quite easy once you actually understand what the units do but for completely mastery of the game there is a huge amount of information to learn Even though the graphics are not as snazzy as newer releases the attention to detail is outstanding The cut scenes are excellent and the storyline is far more involved then other similar games There is an amazing amount of strategic possibilities in this game
In addition to the missions there are a bunches of ready made scenarios and maps in the Custom Scenario section ready to play I suspect these were not in the original version but since I dont have any documentation I cant say for sure
So if you have played more recent titles and are wondering if this will seem dated rest assured that on the fun factor scale it compares very favorably to newer titles But if you have never played this type of game you may want to consider another title first unless you have a friend to help you out or are willing to invest the time needed to figure it out on your ownThe first Gabriel Knight game was about a voodoo cult in New Orleans the second was about a werewolf murder in Germany and the third is about  vampires  In this episode Gabriel sets out to solve the abduction of a  mans child and crack the mystery behind an age old Vampire cult
The  pros of the game are the graphics and controls  Its really great to be  able to pike the camera at whatever angle you want and examine things  Everything is rendered so the screen is more than just a backdrop that you  cant peek behind  Almost everything is something you can examine  closer
The puzzles are also logical  They make sence instead of being  wild things like ripping the leaves off a plant and combing them with a  rubber duckie or some other hairbrained idea  I also loved the animation  For polygon rendered people and buildings they were impressively  handled
There were only two things about this game that I have any sort  of beef with  Firstly the character of Gabriel seemed to have lost a bit  of his tact and charm  In the first game Gabriel could charm the pants off  of just about anyone he met and could smooth talk his way just about  anywhere he pleased  Although the voice actor was the same man as the  first GK game he seems to have forgoten Gabriels smooth cajun accent for a  horribly sounding southern drawl
And also the game didnt seem to like  my ATI graphics card so although I had the game for a couple of months I  wasnt able to play it until I upgraded my card to something else
But  that aside Id still reccomend it to any adventure game fan in a  heartbeatI heard that this game had garnered a good reputation but until now it had never piqued my interest There are so many games in the realtime strategy genre  you have classics like Age of Empires  and Command   Conquer or total stinkers like Tiberian Sun
Its important to remember  that Starcraft was created at least two years before Age of Empires  Its  obvious that AOE borrowed some good ideas from Starcraft The main one  being those of unit limits In Starcraft you have a  unit limit so its  still possible to build a huge army But you also have to balance that  against the number of units you use to gather resources
Another unique  feature of Starcraft is the totally different sides It absolutely amazes  me that a single game can have such diverse armies and yet still manage to  be so well balanced There isnt a single unit in the game that cant be  neutralised by another unit  which is no mean feat considering how  powerful they are
The most interesting aspect to these units are their  special abilities Certain units in each race have special attacks they can  use to neutralise or destroy an opponent For instance the Terran Ghost  soldier can fire an EMP blast that can knock out mechanical units Zerg  queens can fire parasites which attach themselves to enemies allowing you  to see whatever that unit sees The Protoss have the Templar a unit that  uses a chain lightning psionic storm to eliminate whole squadrons of  units
There are certain features which I wish had been implemented Its  not possible to control the behaviour of your units ie setting them to  guard or defensive mode etc This makes it entirely possible for your  entire massed army to chase after a single unit when really you want them  to stay in one place Fortunately a hold command is provided but I  still wouldve preferred to give my units more advanced commands
The  other annoying aspect is map size Its blindingly obvious that the maps  are too small when compared to the size of the units Try leading a group  through a narrow canyon  because there is so little room individual units  will often take a different path to get to a destination
Starcrafts  other strength is in its storyline I have never seen such powerfully  realized characters like this in a computer game In truth there are no  real good guys or bad guys in this game Everybody has their own  motivations for their actions The sequential compaign design only  strengthens this aspect Its unfortunate that Tiberian Suns Michael Biehn  and James Earl Jones didnt have a script like this to play with
In  conclusion Starcraft is everything that Command  Conquer Tiberian  Sun wasnt It has the best designed units of any strategy game It has a  strong storyline which is beautifully realised in the singleplayer  missions And the addition of StarEdit means you can create your own  missions once you tire of the Blizzard approved ones No wonder why this  game has stood the test of time However the omission of advanced unit  controls mean I have to deduct one starYou know when i first saw this i thought it looked like Sim City which i think is a ok game but it gets so boring and after a while it gets dumb But I went over to my neighbors house and saw Roller Coaster Tycoon for  the first time Its awesome Im Going to probably have to force myself to  stop playing it though because its so addicting You just always want to  add more on to your park and get more guests In the game your given  levels Each level has a challenge They give you a certain amount of  money sometimes you can add on loans and a certain amount of time to  get so many guests and have a certain rating for your park In the ride  department you can choose from either prepackaged things or build your own  roller coasters trains monorails log flumes and more You can also add  restaurants and mostly anything you can have in a theme park Also if you  keep a level for a certain amount of time you get more attractions and  rides and restaurants The roller coasters range from regular wooden to  steel to one support steel and any roller coaster you can think of its  awesome It may be a strategy game But its better than any shooter or RPG  that ive ever played BUY ITI was so excited about this game that I played it for  hours straight and completede it The game is great and tons of fun but its just to easy The enemy AI is too predictable and its all too easy to win the  battles But if you want the greatst grafics ever on a PC buy this gameA Game that is still in my library with its sequel  Yeah I like it that much found it addictive and imaginative as well  It is date by todays standards and likely the online play is dead as it was when I attempted to play there  Not to mention those out there playing online are usually hardcore and own any new people as well which was a major frustration when I finished first person a long time ago and attempted to go online haha  This game was fun with its story and is one I consider reloading at times after so many disappointments with newer games that just dont satisfy someone who has played for so many years nor someone who wants to spend so much for so little these days  Todays game are pretty much knock offs level racing mindless hack and slash limited originality limited character uniqueness and profit versus gamer motivated today as well  If you want to give it a try Id say it is worth the ten bucks  If you really like it the sequel is good as well  Space Command and Conquer is a good way to think of this game with a mobile mother ship for game play though it is more multidirectional that c and c  Control might take a little to get use to but who expects a game to practically play itself lolThis game got me interested in the RTS genre all over again It is  wonderful full three dimensions of movement a camera thats easy to use  beautifullyrendered ships and an engrossing storyline The only strikes  against it in my view are the nearidentical ships of the playable races  and the lack of variety in Homeworld multiplayer missions
Still this  game is the first of the D RTS genre or at least the first to do it with  any real style and the yardstick by which all future comers will be  measured  its still a wonderful gameBreath of Fire III arrives almost three years after the funbut strictly orthodoxSuper NES title Breath of Fire II Although BOFIII isnt a radical departure from the earlier games in the series dont let that turn you off its reassuring to see that sprite graphics havent given way entirely to origamistyle polygons Sporting a quasimedieval European setting a heroic story line and turnbased battles BOFIII will appeal to fans of Squares Final Fantasy series and Working Designs Lunar titles An Epic Journey Breath of Fire III starts with the discovery of a tiny dragon that goes on a deadly rampage before its captured The dragon escapes and is transformed into a young boy named Ryu who is befriended by a pair of delinquents whose thoughtless pranks get them captured by some truly evil people Ryu is left for dead but his dragon powers revive him so he sets off in pursuit of his friends captors unaware that hes about to be drawn into an everdeepening pool of danger deceit and death Like earlier BOF titles Ryu can befriend several partners during his epic journey Nina the princess of Windia makes another appearance in the series although in this game shes apparently unrelated to her earlier incarnations Ryu too shares the name of a character from the series but hes also unrelated However Gobi from the first BOF game makes a cameo appearance Nostalgic Graphics Graphically BOFIII is leaps and bounds ahead of its predecessors Texturemapped polygons are used to create the backgrounds terrain and buildings while sprites are used to compose the various characters More animation colors and special effects have been added to this version but the look of the game will still be familiar to fans of the BOF games The threequarteroverhead view field map can be rotated somewhat so you can peek behind obstacles but not to any great extent Battles are fought directly on the field map with characters and monsters displayed diagonally in one of four directions Two are seen from the front and two from the rear
Solid Craftsmanship The battle system is turnbased with some consideration given to quickness Characters move in sequence to their speed parameter For example in some battles you may want to use light armor so that your character moves quicker instead of heavy armor which can slow you down Also certain characters have speed parameters higher than their enemies and may get extra turns while fighting Beyond the usual manual magic and item attacks characters can transform into dragons Initially only Ryu has the power to transform and only when hes far into the game but the other characters gain that power later Transformation though requires crystals called Dragon Genes and AP magic points for the Genes chosen By combining up to three Genes different dragons can be created the more Genes you use the more powerful your dragon though youll use more AP AP is also consumed at a constant pace while the dragon is in battle Finally you can learn monster skills for special attacks and spells The construction of Breath Of Fire IIIs battle systemand of the whole game for that matteris very polishedthanks to excellent controls You wont be moaning about the way this game handles Sound Bites However all isnt well in BOFIII The sound effects are fine if not particularly inspired In battle the characters emit rudimentary shouts screams and spell names but not much more And even though the sounds can get annoying theyre not anywhere near as badly done as the soundtrack The music veers widely from unmemorable electronica to hopeless schmaltz and more often than not it doesnt add to the atmosphere of the story The music seems more appropriate for a corporate infomercial than a heroic fantasy RPG Aside from the inexplicably bad soundtrack BOFIII is worth a long look from RPG fans Although it doesnt possess the visual and aural magnificence of Final Fantasy VII which few games will ever accomplish Breath of Fire III holds up as a very enjoyable RPG in which sure craftsmanship is easily evidentWhen I first started playing this game I was awestruck by the amazing graphics  I installed it everything ran smoothly and even though the tutorial level was extremely long I didnt tire of it simply because  everything was so impressive looking even at the meager x res I  started at
I played the campaign next and although it was pretty cool  that you had the same resources and ships from level to level the levels  themselves were extremely easy I know that because I suck at RTS games and  I didnt have to reload once on this one  It also was boring having to  collect every last scrap of resources at the end of the levels in order to  support your fleet through the next threat
Even through all of this I  thought it was a very fun addictive game but when I started playing  multiplayer it dawned on me where this game really lacks  theres not  enough variety  The ships arent varied enough and even though its D  theres only one terrain type  space  Theres just not enough variety  for it not to get boring after too long
So even with the stunning  graphics compelling music and simple but effective cutscenes the  unintuitive gameplay and the sameness of it all brought this still very  good game down to only  starsIm not an RTS real time strategy fanatic by any stretch of the imagination  but I was eager for this game  This game plays extremely well as a single player game  complete with new twists to the realtime  genre no buildings you keep your fleet with you from scenario to  scenario full D space with intuitive controls
Homeworld takes the  basic tenants of a real time strategy and slows the pace down a bit to  provide fleet action that reminds you of scenes from your favorite scifi  movies and TV shows
The story is extremely well done with scripted  ingame sequences and good storyboard artwork that makes the story  compelling and interesting rather than fluff added at the  end
Its a solid multiplayer game  but only against other humans  Much  like Total Annhilation the AI simply isnt up to the task of taking on  multiple allied humans even if you give it the benefit of  numbers
Overall  its a great game If the multiplayer AI were more  vicious youd see  stars from meThis game is great Even though it is pretty old it is still a super sick game to play Fun and challenging and if its too hard you can use cheats to help you Good funWith the genre monopolized by the the Final Fantasy series it is not suprising that this game is absent from most peoples top RPG list To clarify it is not as good as an FF game but it is nonetheless enjoyable and fun
The story is pretty linear the characters are well developed and part III offers much of the same fun that was the original BOF for the SNES which was produced by Squaresoft not Capcom The only drawback is the clunky controls which can be frustrating when you are trying to move down stairs or bend around tight corners And while the graphics are not on par with Final Fantasy IX or Chrono Cross this is still a great looking game
Try it I think you will like itJust so you know I am only going to discuss singleplayer version because I never tried multiplayer
You have Warcraft you have Diablo and then you have Starcraft  Diablo and Warcraft have gone off to have  and in Warcrafts case  but Starcraft has nothing but a Brood War expansion  I cant see why
Starcraft is fantastic  You have three different races that are unique in their own way  Different buildings different units different ways of evolving heck just about everything is different between each race  I think that is pretty cool
I personally like the custom scenarios  I also like a really cool scenario that is kind of like a arcade game where you try to protect your nexus protoss main building from oncoming enemies  and get galactic heroes if you survive
I found the actual campaign a bit too difficult for me with some missions seeming just plain impossible  It also takes a while to master each race I like the protoss but the Zerg are in my opinion the easiest to fight with  But it is still fun and I really like some of the heroes especially the Protoss heroes
Finally I like making my own scenarios  It seemed difficult and a little confusing at first but I eventually got the hang of it
Go out and buy this gameIf you are a World War II buff and love flight simulators Microsofts Combat Flight Simulator  WWII Europe Series is for you
Using the same attention to detail as in its Flight Simulator series  indeed you can import worlds from the civilian game to this war one  Combat Flight Simulator allows you to fly in two Campaigns The Battle of Britain and The Battle for Europe as a pilot in the RAF Luftwaffe or USAAF US Army Air Forces
Combat Flight Simulator  Europe lets you fly many of the famous fighters in service in those three air forces If you fly as a British pilot you can expect to be at the controls of a Hawker Hurricane Mk Mark I a Supermarine Spitfire Mk I or a later variant the Mk IX  As a German pilot youll fly either the Messerchmitt Bf E or the FockeWulf Fw A fighters  Finally as a Yank in the USAAF youll man either the sturdy PD Thunderbolt or the sleek P Mustang  All of these planes have their strengths and weaknesses so try to read the manual or the Help files and do a bit of research before you hook up the joystick and take flight  Particularly challenging are the ammunition load limits to each plane each plane has its own ammo load capacity and players more familiar with fighter jet simulations such as Microproses famous F Strike Eagle series may find themselves shooting away all their ammo at one plane if they choose realistic presets and then being unable to shoot at anyone else because they have no bullets  I would advise rookie pilots to use Unlimited Ammo settings until they have had enough practice to shoot down enemy bombers and fighters without wasting precious rounds
The simulation not only has the two Campaigns I mentioned earlier but it has Free Flight Quick Combat Single Mission and Training modes  Quick Combat particularly is good for players who like both flight simulations and arcade games  This option lets you choose what and how many enemy planes you can face off against where the fight takes place what weather conditions are like time of day and tactical situation  The enemy comes at you in waves like in an arcade game and as soon as you dispatch one wave another appears  The challenge here is to shoot down as many planes as you can before you either run out of gas or are shot down Unlimited Ammo should be your choice in this sort of game no mater how good you are unless you can shoot down one plane with one bullet  Here skills learned in a jet fighter simulation will not help you
For players weaned on jet fighter games it would be advisable to use the nons HUD Heads Up Display view option  I since I am new to this game myself still use it in the Campaign mode since the Cockpit view option while more realistic is still a bit overwhelming to me  Purists andor experienced pilots can set realism to  to their hearts content but casual players or rookies should start out easy then gradually increase the realism settings
The graphics are excellent even for a era game  Being a Microsoft game it runs on most Windows platforms except  and I am sure no one reading this review still has that operating system  I particularly like the worlds depicted you actually get a sense of flying over s Europe  The sound is also good and you can even hear your fellow pilots radio calls Like the more advanced flight simulations the Single Mission and Campaign games are very realistic in that you fly with a squadron something I never experienced in F Strike Eagles IIII  I did once own Microproses F Fleet Defender a game that had AI wingmen but I could never get it to run on any of my machines
Microsoft also offers a Pacific series counterpart which I am hoping to get soon  Check to see if they have expansion kits  Many simulations ranging from flight to Star Wars starfighter games have them and I believe Combat Flight Simulator is no exception
Oh yes Good luck happy landings and good huntingBasically Breath of Fire  stole a lot of ideas from its predecessor this one Its kinda like a degraded Breath of Fire  actually but still truly brilliant and well worth buyingA police officer I knew got me into this game  I didnt think much of it because it was essentially the same game design as the venerable DUNE and War Craft games  One Age of Empires as originally designed was never meant to be the huge slug fest that it ultimately turned into  The icons on the map were meant to be just that icons representing single armies  But the players demanded more and a patch was released allowing multiple units to be manifested on the map  Result that icon that was supposed to represent an army suddenly became a single unit in the army

So instead of a game where you see elements of civilization compete and clash as was the intent new users essentially got another massive army combat game  Not a big deal  It was fun all the same  I was befriended by some guys on the old MS Gaming Zone and wed have a blast after work or school going late at it late at night  And then on the weekends wed have marathon games in the morning

Great fun lots of fond memories  Ill never forget my Age of Empire days

I think the games well past its peak but even as a solo effort its slightly amusing

EnjoyThis is one of the best classics game Ive ever had This game is released years ago yet this game is still a fun game to play today

This games requirements are not high and this game can be installed on slower PCs or laptops If you like this game you may want to add the expansion pack available to enhance the features on this gameWhen I first loading this game there was many graphics problems and hanging up on my computers part  I have a relatively new computer compared to when this game came out in   This is a good game but make sure before you buy it that you have the best graphics card possible or else youll run into the same problems I didThis is a great game Its going for  now damn good deal A lot of fun Well worth ten bucks Plays on lap tops So you can have something to do at work  Wyatt KaldenbergThis was the only Breath of Fire game Ive beaten  But I must say that it was fun  The story and side quests kept me going
One of the downers was that you cant hardly change your angle
A big thumbs up going to the fact that you dont have to change screens to get into a battle like Chrono Trigger  This saves lots of time and makes thing more dramatic  Fighting in narrow hallways and thick forests was great
Im not going to spoil it for anyonebut the ending sucked badly  But not enough to stop me from buying the next sequel  Microsoft has given all other WW simulators a challenge This game has great graphics and gameplay and at times good cinemas but not the greatest  Its hard to play without a joystick and a good system if your  speed is not a Pentium  or higher it could be a little slow Its still  fun though The missions are fun and fast paced although it takes a while  to get used to and be able to handle the plane Also in battle its  sometimes hard to get the other planes but the bombers youll probably get  on your first try but it still takes a while to get the others There are a  number of different aircrafts but only a couple available in each mission  It is a challenging and fun game I reccomend it to people who like air  combat and flight gamesI really enjoy playing this game  In the beginning I found it a bit confusing compared to Age of Empires an absolutely excellent game so I didnt really like it  I eventually became better and now I find it very fun to play  It is set in the future and you can have your choice of whowhat you are  There are some really cool aliens  Take a look at this game  Its great for someone who likes stragedy  Planning your next move against the enemy  Highly recommendedThis was a really fun game to me I enjoy challenges and puzzles and this game offers many of each They got the sarcastic one liners of Indy down pretty well though it would have been a lot cooler if Harrison Ford voiced it The game has an intriguing story though somewhat far fetched but its a game The graphics were a bit on the mediocre side for the requirements but it didnt take away from the game play The controls are good but I find sometimes they dont respond like they should My only real complaint is how linear the game is There is only one way to go and that doesnt make the puzzle solving the most fun sometimes Good game overallThis is a great follow up to Fate of Atlantis and its nice to see Indy jumped into D The textures are really nice and it carries a lot of Typical Indy puzzles Sure it looks  a lot like Tomb Raider but you know Indy was there first This game needs to be ported to PS The only downfall is theat the programming is a little tempermental in Win but then again what isnt Plus there are patches for this game this is worth the buy You wont be disappointedI had big worries about this game  I used to play the old point and click adventures of indy and I was worried that like its predisecors this would be insanley difficult  Thankfully it is not  I am a bad puzzle solver and luckily With the exception of the pyramid of the sun dial puzzle none of the puzzles are that hard  The graphics are quite nice and the levels are gigantic and tempt lots of exploration  All of the characters are well done and interesting  The music is nice and you have a lot of neat weapons to choose from  However this game does have some flaws  First off sometimes you will be walking around wondering what the heck you are supposed to be doing  Second some of the enviorments are way too big  The third and biggest flaw is that the last levels are way out of place  The nd to last is strange but acceptable but the last level is wayyyy out of place  The last flaw is that the ending is really dissapointing  Overall this is a fun game that will take up a lot of your time and is definatly one of the better Lucasarts titlesAs I said This is a good game Acctually its a great game One of the best strategy games i have playedAlong with Age of Empires  and The Sims  I have always liked another game age of empires as whellI reccomend you check that out too But this is a little bit different  Unlike in AoE were you just control humans in this you control one of three species The Zerg The Protoss or the TerranHumanEach with there own special units and abilitys  The Graphics are acctually pretty good Though some looks a little to cartoonyNot cartoony i mean to much like animated stough  You have  campiangs to playDuh one for each RaceSpecies  The one problem with it is its map editer  I had always liked creating my own maps and scenarios in Aoe and was looking forward to creating maps on this game but was dissapionted  You can decide on the terrain and were resurces are and where you start but thats about it  It has this stupid dfault thing were evan if you DO put units They just put your town centerConrl centerNexus etc and four worker units  There is suppose to be some thing you type in in the propertis box to change this but it never works no matter what I do  Despite this problem its a good game  Buy itThis game is great and it is a great game overall in order for LucasArts to strike back at Eidoss Tomb Raider for trying to take away Indys title of the greatest adventure dude out there  The game is one of the best I  have played but if you do the wrong thing the game crashes  MOST of  these problems can be fixed by downloading patches at lucasartscom but I  really hate the hassle this causes  Make sure you know how to get a patch  if you get this gameIf youve never played the Quest for Glories then youre missing out on a lot  Theyre really great games with a combat system that is quite addictive  My own personal gripe with this collection is that I cant get  Quest for Glory  to work on my computer its too advanced  Sure I  could start all over but my guys a Paladin and hes got  points in all  statistics  Still these games are some of the best and if you havent  played them or if youve wiped them off your hard drive then this  collection is really worthwhile to getStarCraft is always fun although you start getting bored with the same  old sprites after a while The balance of three different races is great  although youll have to download patches for the latest game balance  necessary for Internet play Gameplay itself is easy to get a grip on  blut very hard to master Still the game allows players to just build up  big powerful units and bulldoze to victoryThis game introduced me at a young age to communial development planning and money management This game is I guess you could say one to grow with it takes time and it helps one to learn along the way Id also like  to add that it helps especially a younger mind to experience freedom with  their money allowing them to spend it as they choose If heshe spends it  unwisely go bankrupt that person will know to become better managers of  their money the next timeIve had fun with this game for hours and hours  The gameplay is god  The only  bad things is the graphic arent that great and flood cant wide the city off the face of the earth  Its worth the buyGood descent ww sim but we must remember this sim is old so the graphics are not going to be the best in the world Its sort of a classic The planes probably handled the same as they did during that particular timeDiablo is the game that changed everything  I had high hopes for this expansion  This expansion was published by Sierra not Blizzard and it shows  The install insists on installing bloatware  The Monk is added to the playable characters but is not well thought out  A monk should be a hand fighter but instead it uses the staff like a wizard  The special ability to locate treasure is nice but because the search skill can be learned in a book it is not unique like the trap finding of the rouge or the smithing skill of the warrior  The monk is a disappointment  There are a lot of new items mostly traps  Because it adds items the player does not find as many good items as it raises the probability of finding them  I did not find any new quests  This is a very old game and while fun it wont run in Windows   I had to dig out a very old XP computer before I could play it  I am glad that Blizzard has not allowed other publishers to create expansions since  I am glad to have played this expansion but I dont think it was worth the price  The seller however was wonderful  I would recommend himYoull have to create a COMMANDTXT folder  place multitest cowquest theoquest bardtest barbariantest to unlock some of this stuff The Monk can either bee seen as some kind of Joke OR the most challanging character to play The Bard  Barbarian are improved versions of the Rogue  Warrior in that they can wield two handed weapons at a time The cowquest is funny Not having played Diablo without the expansion I cant say what else is new but I DO like that this game has the SAVE ANYWHERE feature than many games after it neglected There are an aweful lot of different dungeon maps so I suppose some were added as well as armor weapons monsters extra difficulty On the negative side it didnt add better voice actingWhen this came out everyone went crazy because it was new and the games were on discs Which is much eaiser and handier to keep clean and take places Most people had a N before this and even at the same time so they were used to the cartridges which were big and bulky and somewhat annoying It has two memory card slots and two controller slots and it can play compact dics so you can listen to music when your bored on your tv with your own cds Most games on this console had good graphics back then so people thought it was amazing They became highly addicting and very fun to play This became the most popular system in the USA and almost everyone had one back then Many games get scratched and broken as time goes on since they are old but try to keep them in their own cases they came in so they will play better and much longer with out the annoying freezing and skipping of the game I am saying this because many games will not play or work anymore because of the lost case so they were just thrown around in the closet untill i finally put them in a computer case way back whennow i am more protective of the games because it is very dissapointing to find that your favorite game will not work anymore and you have to go through the trouble to buy them online because stores do not keep or sell them anymore This is a very good console that i would purchace if you do not have a ps or just to have this original masterpiece to bring back memoriesRight up front you need to know that this is not an easy game  Video jocks who play all those fast paced and basically brainless real time strategy games will probably not go for this one  However thoughtfull  players with some tactical skill who like a real challenge will find this  game very rewarding
The heart of the game is its tactical combat system  which is by far the best that Ive seen in any fantasy game  Maneuver  plays a big part in it  Using your faster units to circle around and hit  your opponents archers  Using your slower melee units to screen your  archers from his troops  Using the terrain to set up kill  zones that you can lure your opponent into  It will take a little  getting used to so expect to loose your first few battles until you figure  out how things work
The game has an interesting variety of units and  spells and a particularly nice selection of artifacts that you can find in  dungeons and such
The strategic level is good but not great You collect  resources you build things you research spells same as in most games  One nice addition is the ability of high level characters to train new  units letting them start off with some experience  This solves the  problem that occurs in so many games of this type where new units starting  late in the game are basically hopeless
The two real weaknesses in the  game are    A very limited diplomatic engine  There are a total of eight  powers in the game but your options for peacefull interaction with the  other seven are pretty limited   Weak AI players at least on the  strategic levels  Some of the computer players do absolutely suicidal  things like walking their undefended leader up to one of your strongholds  Even the toughest Balkoth Lord of Death isnt nearly as aggressive as he  should be
Overall this is a challenging but very interesting game that  players with some tactical skill will really enjoy
Oh and one fast note  for new players The hardest part of the game is the opening  To maximize  your survival chances make your starting character a wizard of life then  on your first four turns attack four level one dungeons  Then use all  your resources to hire mercenaries and attack the great temple
Good  luckThis game was great back when games sucked  If Sierra remade this game and released it now with added civilization rts properties for each race fire giants wind giants water people earth dwarves ect it would  hold its own against all of its current competitors

It has amazing music artwork and you can really tell that the makers spent hundreds of hours making sure everything was seamless  Even the one glitch that this game has the Life Staff glitch only makes the game more fun  Its an old game but classic and with added expansionist features combiningnbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefAgeofWondersIITheWizardsThronedpBYTYKrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTFAge of Wonders II The Wizards Throneanbspandnbspa datahookproductlinklinked classalinknormal hrefSidMeiersCivilizationCompletedpBBWYKrefcmcrarpdrvwtxtieUTFSid Meiers Civilization  Completeanbspwith Lords of Magic they could have a game that would stand the test of time

HECK  If my Win ran Lords of Magic I would still play it because theres just something about the music the artwork and the gameplay that really pulls you inThe metal bookmark has a couple of weird flaws in it  I wish that all the cloth maps that were included with the books individually were included in this set but its worth losing those to get this cool setDont get me wrong I enjoyed this game from front to back It has graphics that while not amazing you wont be confused about anything visually The sound however should be award winning It is simply magnififcent and gives you the feel of combat when the combat music is playing of course
BUT This game has bugs One really bad one I found is when i was making a trade this is a easy thing to do and will happen often I paid a lot of gold and stuff for some crossbowmen and I never got them It has only happened to me two times
The game features a quest pack but I dont find it fun They expect you to win against dozens of creatures and evil guys and God knows what else while you control at best six or seven creatures
The Lords of Magic part however is much better You control one of  Faiths each with different creatures buildings and spells Some of them are much better off than others the weaker faiths have many more allies The stronger faiths tend to have more enimies Two Faiths Fire and Choas start out with only one ally which is each othertwo other faiths view them as neutral
No matter what you do your opposite faith and the Death faith start out powerful This adds a new challenge to the game The Death faith is out to kill everyone
So this game has good graphics sound and completly different gameplay It does have bugs but they wont ruin it for you You should check out this game Now Im going to go play a game that you for whatever strange reason you have still have to purchaseSins of the Fathers first game While primitivelooking by todays  standards this is a surprisngly deep and compelling game  The characters  convey actual personality from Gabriels machismo to Graces waspishness  and you cant help but be swept up in this story of voodoo and destiny  Even the midi music is pretty cool though it might drive you insane if you  stay in one area too long
 Beast Within second game A  fullmotionvideo game that shows you just how good the format can be  While I didnt care so much for the guy who played Gabriel everyone else  especially Grace did an incredible job  In this game Gabriel has  accepted his heritage to a point but wont accept help from Grace  Not  that that stops Grace little does  In this game you switch between the  two as they work on the case from both ends I found myself enjoying  Graces detective work more than Gabriels good ol boy attempts at  sleuthingthough both are fun Werewolves missing Wagnerian operas and  dead Bavarian kings all combine in an enthralling story that sweeps you  along impatient for the next video clip  And the musicboth the opera  itself and the incidental music set the mood and immerse you fully in this  epicFor the price this is definitely a game set worth considering Both games  are quite good although definitely the second is the one that makes this  buy worthwhile The first game is definitely a bit ancient in terms of  graphics and gameplay
But Gabriel Knight wow what a game I played  it twice something I never do with adventure games But this one was SO  well written and conceived and it was recognized by many folks as a Game  of the Year It truly does immerse you in the story and some of the final  movie sequences are superbly done Great locations great plot definitely  a game you HAVE to play if you havent alreadyDespite not being a fan of other Janes Fighters games I enjoyed this entry  The premise is obvious  fly missions in Europes warton skies in the famous fighters of the day  The format of the sim is similar to that of other Janes fighters titles  you have a flight panel thats more for show than functional you have separate popup windows for your instruments or to spot and range the enemy you can click on individual targets and handy steering cues point the way to the enemy  That said WWF is graphically a more modern generation of sim than those like USNF or ATF  Graphics are more realistically defined and are more immersive than those games  The planes instantly recognizable to any milav buff look so realistic you half expect to see your reflection in their chrome finish  Atmospheric effects are clearly superior to the first CFS which roughly coincided with this game  including clouds AAA fire and smoke effects from wounded aircraft  Flight is difficult even at nominal settings  aircraft here are unstable and may fly apart if overstressed or simply fall out of the sky if loadfactor isnt watched  AI is somewhat impressive I mean I routinely got shot out of the sky but Im normally a horrible pilot though must be compromised to an extent to fit a game where everybody in fighters will fight each other  Case in point being Me jets which will remain in prolonged combat with prop fighters like the Mustang even though there principal quarry was the box formations of allied bombers their acceleration and turning capabilities made them unsuited for dogfighting  For its great atmospheric effects nothing seems to cover up an unconvincing attempt to model the terrain of Europe  although most of your work will be up high  The campaign mode isnt quite dynamic but its not as canned as the one on CFS

In short this is as solid WW sim  perfect for those intimidated by the hardcore realism and hardware requirements of IL but left hungry by CFS

I ran this on a Pentium  with XP and a MB GF cardThis game is great I have a new computer and I still am able to go back  to BroodwarStarcraft even though it may seem outdated It just shows that  a game is built off of more than graphics and more on replay value and  gameplaywhile the graphics are not that advanced it is still one of the best turn based strategy games available the different cultures each have an individual feel to them and the advancement is both fast and enjoyableIve owned this game for many years so long I dont even remember  pre To the best of my memory this game occurred when Sid and the Civ people were having a bit of falling out so Sid moved to Fireaxis and produced this game which built into it many of the improvements that he forsaw for Civ it was in some ways a pointer to CIV III and some of the changes to occur there

Being a  game it has primitive graphics no D etc as in todays games but I still think theyre decent Also like Civ II this is not a halfhour game it can go on for some time but at least you can save it and pick it up later

It does occur beyond Civ after the launch of the spaceship and colonization of space and involves a new set of races and a new tech tree Some call the tech tree too foreign or hard to understand but I dont really think so the techs may seem artificial or invented while the Civ techs seem real that is techs based on things we are familiar with To me they are just a ladder to climb to more advanced capabilities wonders called special projects social options units etc

The game can be won through diplomacy conquest transcendence sort of a humanevolution event economics cooperative and many rules can be turned onoff and iron man mode

Further there is major flexibility in choosing not only governments but also economics military education environment big factor in this game research health etc And you can take stances ruthless moderate or idealistic for military interactions  Trade still can play a big role too

This is not a war game though it can be played that way instead it is an influence and strategy game Without being too longwinded I think its strong points are relative to Civ II
 You can use the governor much better including customizing it to your own rules as opposed to the governor in Civ which I dont know anyone who uses including unit automations These are especially useful in  to reduce the tedium in the ICS Infinite City Sprawl and popbooming strategies often employed where there may be MANY MANY cities
 Strategic deallings with other civs are crucial to a successful game
 Boundaries or areas of influence are introduced these help manage warpeace and some of the really annoying situations in Civ II
 You can set ingame slants on the governor as you progress through appropriate play styles of explore discover build and conquer you have to be prepared to play any of them depending on game circumstances
 There are MAJOR improvements in automation beyond just the governor and slants such as using queues for building and group commands like build road to instead of having to go tile by tile to do it The GOTO command is improved too complete with mods like avoid enemies etc
 Instead of a lot of units the units instead are basic but EXTENSIVE mods can be researched and added to basic units to form new capabilities This helps avoid the warrior vs machinegun syndrome
 All units can be upgraded for a fee this is more realistic than the throwaways or needing Leos Workshop wonder
 Materials dont have to be in the city to use it they can be teleported to other cities from one city or from a distant location if you can control the land

Well you get the idea its just a lot of new stuff 

I DONT particularly like the huge differences among the races some of which have such constraints that they are virtually impossible to win a game with only  or so really lend themselves to playable games But I dont think this is a game stopper just a constraint It would be nice if some of the traits could be modified to more balance the game but I truly think they were created to be a foil to the human player As you play you can use the social engineering for some balancing

The game is richly complex with numerous inplay options mods and social structures etc that can give play variations

All in all I find it to be a game offering many enjoyable hours though it is hard to FORCE IT to play your play style you instead have to probe for play styles that fit the nature of the challenges of your particular game I still find myself playing this now and then even  years after its release

It can be purchased now for the  range including shipping Id say its a definite option at those pricesI bought this game at a EB store It was one of the most interesting civ games I have ever played It had verry good game concpts and I played for hours on end And that was about  to  years ago I still remeber playing it But then again I like all civ games It got  stars over all But I only got  stars of fun out of it I finaly got burnt out on it and traded it And I have nothing but good memories from playing it Planting forest and reaserching biomorphic fugi And the wierd mind worms which took the place of barbains Differnt factions such as chairman yang of the hive and more cool stuffThis is a good space simulator  It allows you to control many different aspects of your people including socioeconomic model resources transportation security etc  It also allows you to design your own units based on what technologies you have researched  It is also a good macroscopic military strategy game  It is turnbased so if you play only RTS dont play this  If you dont mind turnbased games though and you like spacebased strategy games you should play this  The graphics are secondrate but that is just because it is oldAlpha Centauri is a turnbased citybuilding strategy a great followon but not a sequel to Civilization II The game adds a lot of diplomacy features although I usually try to wipe the other players out Alpha Centauri has automation features too City governors who decide what to build although sometimes they would try to build something they shouldnt such as the Build governor making military units Overall a classic recommended for most and a must have for Civilization fansHaving played more games of Civ II than I care to remember I was really looking forward to this game Initially I had thought it was just more of the same and I should have saved my money and kept playing Civ II Dozens  of games later I can honestly say this game was well worth the  I had  paid and at the current price of  its a real deal The game isnt a  departure from Civ II in anyway and may fall short of others expectations  when they are anticipating Civ III but with any amount of game play they  will be pleased Is it the same game Basically yes Are there THAT many  improvements No Is it better than Civ II Yes Just the little things  like unit customization new techs new races improved network play etc  make it worth it in my book Ive had the game since it was released and  still play on occasion and most likely will still play a year from now If  you approach this game not expecting it to be a huge breakthrough in the  Civ series then you wont be disappointedThe game is Civ in a new world so I guess we could also call it Civ After our rocket landed The interface is pretty much the same if we neglect optical changes From  nations we got  factions which are  specialized in Civ there were no special abilities so you have to know  from the beginning to which type you are most suited Automation is by my  opinion not very helpful the most helpful thing is building queue which  enables you to forget many smaller cities until they grow to size  or   then you must check every such city or bigger ones regularly if you want  to make enough progress Great bonuses can be won from the seas not  usable in Civ and City improvements and Wonders are little more numerous  than in Civ The whole scene is almost too dark and morbid Alpha Centauri  is a sun therefore a planet could at least have a little light it runs  very slowly units travel as they would take sedatives all time and the  diplomacy is very limited as is perhaps in real life but every faction  leader is tremendously aggressive Therefore best start for you is even  more essential than in Civ if you fall back at the beginning it will be  very hard for you to gain back what you missed The terrain is extremely  unpleasant and it can also be of great importance where you land I had  best experience with the science faction Zakharov because I was able to  overcome my opponents through technology The game is very uneven from the  beginning if you dont get a good draw you are soon in trouble and it  could run much faster That took away one star for her Otherwise  if you  like Civ and if you dont mind too much about this lacks its no question   buy it If you expect another revolution form Sid lean back play  another Civ  and wait for part The reason Im still getting PSX games is nostalgia but also because there are few games these days that match the awesomeness of the wipeout franchise Having played this on both PSX PSP and PS I must say the wipeout games never disappoint The techno soundtracks are a good match for this type of racing game If you are like me it will not matter if you get this or the more recent versions it will be as funIve enjoyed this game for years It doesnt get old Lost my original copy and had to get anotherKings quest collection is very good  It has all of the kings quest games except Kings Quest   It also includes other neat games from the same creators  The collection is pretty challenging and will keep you up late in the night for months  Very funIve been a huge fan of Kings Quest for a long timeI think it was the  first game I played that actually had better than monochrome graphics on my  x
The first three games are the best which is odd cause their  graphics are the worst by todays standards four and five are pretty  cool Six and Seven had cartoonlike graphics but didnt seem to have the  adventurous feel of the others The first one is still the most fun and  they even added both the old classic version and a newer version with  better graphics
If youve played either Space Quest or Police Quest  youll get an instant feel for this oneThe Kings Quest series are probably the most memorable adventure games in  existance  They appeal to children adults men and women alike  The  games are serious slapstick romantic dashing and so many other things  all rolled into one  I really loved this series and Im glad that someone  decided to package them
Each game follows a member of the Daventry  family in one manner or another  As an added bonys girls sometimes the  hero is actually a heroine  As the series progress you can watch the  Daventry family grow have children and suffer tradgedy through at least  three generations
The only thing that might be a problem is that as some  of these games are old they might not work on newer machines  Make sure  that you have all the patches from Sierra and read the documentation  thoroughly in case the games dont function your first try  With a little  bit of computer coaxing you should get them going again but you also might  decide its not worth the troubleThis video game system is great and even though it isnt very noticeable right now it will be a major competitor for the Game Boy Color system and is very compareable The two systems are the same size only the Neo Geo Pocket is horizontal instead of vertical The system also has a bigger screen with sharper and more colorful graphics The joystick is a bit hard to use but you will get used to it The one major gripe I have with this system is the fact that there arent really any standout games right now I do like the fighting games and I have Neo Turf Masters Sonic Pocket Adventures and Dark Arms Beast Buster  which are all good games but they arent very noticeable Still Id buy this system and make these games noticeable because the games and system deserve itIt seems some people dont like Call to Power because its not Sid Meirs Civilzation but thats exactly the point Its a different game This game is kind of a hybrid between Sid Meirs Civilization and Age of Kings I think the AI intelligence is right up there with Civilization by Sid Meir Also the graphics are pretty good too This game is old so it may not be up to some peoples standards Also I like the huge maps and the lots of advances city improvements and units Quite frankly I like Call to Powers spaceage military units better than Civilizations If youre looking for a Sid Meir clone dont buy this But if youre looking for a fun alternative this could be for youLet me start out by saying I waited some time until purchasing this software because of the bad reviews  Im a huge fan of the first two games but decided to hold off on this one until the price dropped  Something about not having Sid Meiers name in the title
I have to tell you though I was impressed by what I saw  Perhaps it was because I was expecting a terrible sequel but Call to Power Civ  is a better surprise compared to Civilization   There are more changes and the game is more complex  As a matter of fact I find this game more challenging than the previous two
Now dont let this review get you enthusiastic about the game because on the same token you might be disappointed with the sequel  There are gameplay problems such as a new macro economy that doesnt seem to have been well planned out by the designers no scenarios or predesigned maps specifically the world map a combat system that leaves you in disbelief when your M soldiers are wiped out by cowboys etc  I was also disappointed by the new wonders Im not sure how the copyright worked out with the new company but I felt the old wonders were more logical  An example is the sphinx instead of the pyramids that seemed to disappear quick as far as their effects because technology is obtained so easilly
If an overhaul of the game was in store I feel that the designers could have put more technologies into the game as well as a better variety of attackdefense units considering it covers so much time  BC  AD
But the price is right for this game at this time  Now that the Call to Power sequel is out I would recommend this game to see if you enjoy the new formatThis is Konamis attempt at ripping off Namcos Ace Combat series  Plain and simple  Whoever was expecting Microsoft Flight Simulator really needs to buy a clue  The Dreamcast is a game CONSOLE people not a PC  There is simply no way to replicate the dozens of keyboard commands required to produce a realistic flight simulation
What does the Dreamcast do best  Correct arcade games  This is an arcade attempt at a flying game  No takeoffs no landings no aileron tweaks no altimeter factoring it is a plain easy to understand straightforward shootemup in the sky  Are the controls sluggish  Yes  Do the different planes really matter  Not really  Will you get any mileage out of the machine guns  Probably not  But this is all par for the course for the kind of game this is
Sky Odyssey for PS is a much more fun and active flying game than this but this is by no means chopped liver  The graphics are often impressive and the game does put up a fight in the later stages  But as long as you arent dumb enough to expect a NASA flight replicator you might very well enjoy this little romp through the unfriendly skies  Who knew terrorists would have the  to own more jet fighters than most industrialized nations
ps How in the world does this game maintain a star review rating average when I know for a fact that I read at least a dozen star reviewsOK first off Id like to say that Um Jammer Lammy is a great game But ONLY for a select few Some people might be turned off by the D graphics and cute characters and it can be frustrating to time yourself while playing the guitar At first I could only get through the levels on the Easy mode but after a while everything gets easier
The main concept is this You are Lammy Um Jammer Lammy a guitarplaying lamb in a rock band called Milkcan which also includes a bassplaying cat a drumming dog and a rapping onion Throughout the whole game you are helping Lammy get out of sticky situations by playing the guitar ex putting out a fire flying a plane You are rated as awful bad good or cool and if you make it to cool you get to solo You play the guitar by pressing different buttons on the control in time to the music and there a guide telling you when to play The songs are catchy and sometimes very funny the animations are funny too but most of the time you are watching a scrolling guide on top of the screen so this game is sometimes more fun for spectators
Um Jammer Lammy has great music good gameplay esp if you like puzzle games or music for that matter imaginative controls and and the whole game is a cool concept come on a guitar playing lamb its never been done before There are hardly any music games out on PSX as far as I know PaRappa the Rapper and Um Jammer Lammy are the only ones but I could be wrong Overall Um Jammer Lammy is a very fun game If youre interested in a challenging game with catchy songs a rock band made of up animals bizarre scenarios or just something different then this is for youAlien VS Predator is the best Alien game released to date I was actually fond of Alien Trilogy and has a lot going for it You can play as a marine alien or predator Playing as the Alien is the easiest  and is pretty difficult to master as first You will need to climb on  walls learn to pounce and sneak up on your targets As the Predator you  will need to use your fast arsenal of weapons visions and invisibility  features to win The scariest and most fun character is the marine You  will need to collect weapons health and watch your back at all times You  never know when an Alien is around the corner And if you see or hear a  face hugger you better start shooting or run for your life If one gets  you you WILL jump from your seat The only drawbacks is that the save game  feature is lame if you download the patch otherwise there isnt a save  game feature and the game will give you extra levels at the end ONLY if  you beat the game at a higher difficulty Other than that if you like the  Alien movies get this I give this title a BThe variety of monsters and weapons is very cool and the story is fun THe controls for combat are good but your character does seem to plod around Its a very good gamethe cd worked for about  days and thenBAM it was skipping like crazy it froze wen i picked Jack or Kunimitsuand now it wont come on at all IT WAS A PRETTY CRAPPY COPYOverview Its a good thing Blue Stinger is a launch title because had it been released later closer to Capcoms Resident Evil Code Veronica it would have been drowned in the torrent of comparison Developed by Climax Graphics of Shining Force Landstalker and Dark Savior fame and published stateside by Activision Blue Stinger with its cliched portrayals and Bmovie voice acting is an adequate if underwhelming entry into the everexpanding genre of survival horror
Graphics   Clean Very clean Thats the most appropriate way to describe the visuals in Blue Stinger The highresolution texture maps and relatively highpolygon models are what youd expect from a nextgeneration console and the developers made sure to add liberal amounts of lighting particle and translucency effects Boss encounters are another notable as they really show off the abilities of Segas machine The only area in which Blue Stinger does not stack up is a big one animation No motioncapture here The characters animate quite stiffly creating a rather slow and goofylooking gait and while this is not totally damning it takes a while to get used to

Sound   Well this is a CDbased machine so the music is high quality Some of it seems a bit out of place for a survival horror game but its not bad This actually works in some places such as the townmarket area where the Christmas atmosphere and music creates an atmosphere eerily reminiscent of the original Gremlins film Voice acting is another thing entirely While I dont think it is quite as bad as most of the professional magazines have made it out to be its definitely of the Bmovie variety perhaps a bit better than the original Resident Evils Maybe
Control   This is Blue Stingers weakest point Analog control is too loose for precision movement while digital simply isnt responsive enough The result is a game thats difficult to play at times when precision movement is critical such as swimming Luckily this isnt a platformer so these are few and far between What really makes the control so lacking is the camera which while far improved over the cinematic one found in the Japanese version thanks to some noticeable tweaking by Activision still manages to get itself in shall we say less than advantageous positions usually theyre experienced while in water or in tight corridors While these are minimal there are more than enough of them to annoy all but the most hardcore gamers
GameplayTheme   Yes Blue Stinger has its problems but it is fun As with any game of this nature part of the fun comes with blasting enemies with highpowered weapons In this area BS delivers Ranging from the usual shotguns and rocket launchers to more exotic weapons such as ray swords a lightsaber ripoff and railguns Each character has their own unique arsenal of weapons which are either found or bought from numerous vending machines located throughout Dinosaur Island Needless exploration and a few vague puzzles can dampen the fun for you remember the passcode  youll need it if you stick with it the experience can be rewarding
Overall   Like many launch titles Blue Stinger is a flawed first effort perhaps moreso than many of the others That said it does have its good points which are far more numerous than the gaming press is willing to let on and while not for every gamer if you like blasting baddies adventuring and a decent story and are willing to work past the flaws Blue Stinger might just be worth a few of your hardearned dollarsBlue Stinger I think is a must own for anyone with a Dreamcast this game is an action game and a survival horror game the first time you complete this game is the best you can complete it many times but you already know whats going to happen Some bad things about this game are their is some annoying music you have to put up with and you end up killing the same mosters over and over again Their is so much more to say about this game but Ill let you figure them out buy this gameGame was great  I recommend it for anybody looking to do some classic gaming on ps This game has many levels and tons of characters to go along with them  Tricks tricks and more tricks that describes this game  Plenty and plenty of game play  If you love skateboarding get this gameThis is an excellent game but not one that you can really jump right into It takes a lot of playing to get used to the MANY controls and commands  Microprose was quite thourough and everything is pretty darn authentic  If youve got the time and patience this game is very rewardingone downside no joystick calibration  or force feedbackotherwise excellentI had another B game some years ago This one is significantly different This is a real challenge First the instrumentation and interior graphics are very good
They could be improved by allowing the flyer to operate the flight deck controls with the mouse but that is nitpicking The exterior graphics are not stateoftheart
but they are plenty good enough to really experience the game The sound is good and realistic

I had better identify my equipment so that you can judge my viewpoint I have a  MHz Pentium  with a halfgig of RAM and my OS is Microsoft Windows ME
Video is ATI I use a CH Flightstick Pro USB and CH Pro Pedals USB with Control Manager The brakes do not work with this simulation

Everything else works fine and the loading was easy

As to my experience Im in my midseventies and made my first solo in the mid s Ive flown a variety of single engine aircraft over the years but have little
multiengine experience and that only as air crew except on the computer Ive also built and flown a variety of radiocontrolled aircraft I have flown just about
every decent simulator on the market since  but my specialty is WWII aircraft since that is my generation Im partial to the Pacific Theater and particularly
love the FF Hellcat as a fighter planeit accounted for nearly  percent of all the Japanese aircraft shot down in airtoair combat in the Pacific and had a 
kill ratio Not bad It also made more aces than any other allied singleengine fighter plane

I mostly fly fighters I think the best combat flight sim for graphics and flight characteristics currently on the market is IL Sturmovik Janes WWII Fighters and
and Microsofts Combat Flight Sim  are neckandneck for second place and Im looking at MS Combat Flight Sim  with high
hopes

This is a good sim It is very realistic in the flight characteristics of a large multiengine prop driven aircraft The sounds are very realistic as well and for those who
think it is a difficult gameit is But then so is actually flying such an aircraft but it can be learned Practice practice practice

The ability to move from one crew position to the next easily is not realistic but it is great fun One thing I appreciate is the very thing that bugs many the fact that
you can spend hours on a single missionin fact you can spend several minutes stacked up orbiting your own airfield just waiting to land after a mission Oh you
can avoid it by speeding things up to X time but of course the actual aircrews were simply stuck with it Thats just the way it was

In real life it was hours weeks sometimes months of boredom interspersed with moments of sheer terror Hurry up and wait was as typical of WWII as Kilroy
was here

But do you want to get a feel for how it really was without the gutwrenching fear of course or do you just want to play another game One thing about the
boredom of hours of droning enginesit lulled the crew so that when the action suddenly started when a Bf or FW or God help us an ME
suddenly bounced you out of the sun it was all the more unexpected

This is of course not like being at war Not even close The people who really flew in these ships actually died as you know More than  men from the th
died over Europe Thats the entire crew of  different aircraft Losses were high It was hard to get through the  missions required alive For the Luftwaffe it
was if anything worse There was no limit to the number of their missions They flew until they were killed or the war ended whichever came first

I recommend this game if you have the patience and the equipment tofly it properly If you are simply looking for something that will allow you to shoot down lots of
enemy quickly this is probably not for you

Joe Pierre USN RetB is a great game  I would give it Stars instead of the  I did but for the normal personnot a nutty a GAMER like me and othersit takes time  I mean  Time to learn to fly figure out what to do with the crew men and TIME to learn every position  That said buy it sit down have a few and learn to have a good TIME at your computerYou bet you do You sweat buckets if its  and youre in a BG Flying Fortress over Germany on a bombing run to your target Bomb doors open steady steadybombs away Two things come to mind  This doesnt sound like a typical flight simulator and  flying straight and steady at  feet doesnt sound like a lot of fun Right on the first but dead wrong on the second This game is different from all other WWII flight sims to date which have largely focused on man on man fighter combat This is a multiple position role playing game whose primary platform is the BG the only disappointment is that there is no multiplayer capability There are  playable positions in the fort including pilots navigator bombardier turret gunners waist gunners and tail gunner The role playing element is so much fun and immersive you may very well find that this is the only flight sim where you spend the least time flying Lets step back into this immersive game world for a minute to see how we arrived over our target in Berlin
Youve finished the pre op reconnaissance briefing and youre on the way out to the tarmac to your fort There she is in all her glory your Patsy Sue Those refitters sure did a nice job repainting the nose art and fixing the damage from the last mission Shes gotten you this far  the th mission Halfway there This missions a beast though  Berlin You say to yourself Can I get the guys through the remaining  missions before we ship back home Pray God let there be no Me s this time
This little immersive scenario is courtesy of the game allowing you to take the role of pilot of your plane or squadron leader in charge of  planes or group commander As group CO you pick the targets plan the missions select bomb loads and assign crews You can also name crews There is an operations room where pre flight recon and post op damage assessment film can be studied Your B is beautifully depicted You can name her as you wish and change the nose art  Lets get ready to take her up on the first of  historically based missions where we will come across other flyable planes Three little friends  Mustang Thunderbolt and Lightning and three German fighters  Me  FW  and the deadly Me 
Engines on Throttles up Lets roll Release brakes adjust trim take off speed were up Navigator set course for Initial Point Weather outside is cloudy Its expected to clear up over the target Coastline coming up now Where is that down there  the Elbe river Good job navigator were right on schedule
Each of the playable positions in this game is incredibly detailed none moreso than the flight deck If the prospect of going through a  step engine start up procedure seems daunting to you then simply jump to another player position and let the computer pilot take off Each crew member has his strenghts Lose a good navigator or bombardier and  youll see the effects in degraded mission success Replacements are never as good The roar of the engines is impressive and so are the other sound effects Hopefully the ones youll hear the most are those of healthy thrumming engines and your  cal guns barking out not the sounds of exploding flak and the screams of your hit crewmen The weather and terrain effects are also fantastic Naturally there are various gameplay keys that provide a myriad of external views of your plane and the formation youre in and there is a timeskip key that rushes you towards the action
Were approaching the target now and beginning our bomb run Out of the blue and shouted over my headphones tail gunner says Bandits Six oclock high coming in now Looks like s Im firing now remember  lead them fire just ahead let them fly into the stream Im missing God what a time to realise I should have put in more practise From the waist position I see a black puff with an evil orange eye burst under the port wing of the fort flying next to us There goes another  over the intercom as it slowly sinks out of formation smoke spewing from two engines Shrapnel has punched holes in our wing metal frame is showing More serious is the injury to the turret gunner Navigator get back there and see what you can do The bombardier calls out  Bomb doors opentime seems to stand still finallyBombs away the shudder and sudden lift confirm it Head for home Starboard outer engine now sputtering any flames No smoking slightly though No need to feather engine How long to go how many injured how bad Did I mention this game was immersive
We were lucky on this mission No major damage and only one injury We also failed Our bombs came down nowhere near the target One of the more arcane skills you can learn in this game is using the Norden bomb sight adjusting for wind drift and making all the necessary adjustments to ensure an accurate drop After unloading pop down to the target view and wait for the thunderous explosion that signals the arrival of your bombs
Now that were safely at base the question is Do you sweat when playing a PC Game You bet you do if its this game The system the game was tested on was a P with  ram and Diamond Viper There were a couple graphical glitches  seams in the terrain being the only one that broke the immersive spellJJGAmes sold it for a good price but its pretty scratched and comes wo the case
This is one of best ps games ever played Pure destruction is what its all aboutI personally like many types of fighting games and FUN is the thing that keeps me coming back for more  A game can have pretty graphics sound great and have all the bells and whistles in the world and still play like   This game might not be as pretty as the Saturn version but who wants a Saturn One of the biggest flops since the future flop of Sonys PS  A few frames missing and slowdown which I have not experienced personally are by no means reasons to dismiss a game that combines Xmen with Streetfighter very well  One more thing to mention about the price  Not to insult anyones intelligence but simply supply and demand It is discontinued there are fewer and fewer copies available thus causing those on the open market to raise in valueIt definitly improved from the first one from the upgrading of the vehicles  Like the one before this one it was funThis game has some of the best graphics that Ive seen for the PSX  It levels are very colorful and filled with futurous scenery  The many powerups and weapons add to the fun in this game  Control is a little hard when you first start playing but it is easy to get used to The craft slide a bit when you are turning  There are only  ships to choose from and some of them arent very good  More tracks wouldnt hurt either  This game is a good game and you should buy itWhen Quake  originally hit the PC its unabashed violence and surprisingly addictive gameplay not only outshined its predecessor it killed it before it hit the ground  The PS and N conversions took much longer than expected to be released and fans of the PC game anxiously awaiting the home versions were a little worried about the quality of the home system versions  When Quake  hit the PS those fears were dead in the dirt  Activision Hammerhead and Id all did a fantastic job bringing Quake  to the PS while keeping a surprisingly smooth frame rate although the graphics arent as good as its PC counterpart but that was expected and the unabashed violent addictive gameplay remains intact  The game makes excellent use of the PSs Dual Shock controller the controls are easy and every button is to be used  While some parts can be frustrating and the game has a rather steep learning curve Quake  is still undeniably fun  Those still holding on to theyre PSs can find this bad boy at a rather cheap price and have a great time with this near classic FPSBefore I get into anything about Quake II I have to say if you still own a Sony PlayStation or like first person shooters in general Quake II is definitely a must own Lots of great things to say about this game

The levels were well designed

Even today the graphics are pretty good as a D polygonal shooter

Love the light sourcing effects that bring realism to the overall look that Quake II has

Very smooth fluidlike gameplay and excellent use of color

Thankfully the game has some pretty tough enemies because I notice with D shooters you dont get huge doses of enemies like you get in the older Doom games

So why stars
Well sigh I was blown away by the first Quake and theres plenty of words for itadvanceddarkcreativeor my choice of word would be primitive Firing a nailgun at an ogre enemy wielding a chainsaw and chucking grenades I thought the Quake series was just going to get more grim with every future release in its polished form Quake II is still a noteworthy shooter but it goes towards a hitechbioorganic cybernetic experiment and does a good job at it Its just that the Quake series didnt stick to a particular formulaThe single player isnt so great but if youve got access to  controllers with duel shock support I highly recommend getting this game and playing a few death match rounds with your buddiesOne of the best FPS for PS One  Great graphics with a surround sound option  Comtrols leave a bit to be desired as far as customization goes  Not much for scares or surprizes and still mildly inferior to the legendary original

Highly recommended to anyone who still plays the old PS

Great shipping and condition of productThis game packs lots of action and a great soundtrack It is great port of the PC game but the levels are not quite the same As one who has played Quake ports or pretty much every available hardware N PSX PC PocketPC Symbian OS Apple iOS Windows Mobile etc this game is invaluableI went through my old Video games weeding out those destined for trade in at Bookmans  I saw this one and remembered liking it so I threw it back in and played it through  I forgot how much fun this game was and highly recommend a retry to those FPS freak out there  I mean you can get this game dirt cheap now and it is a total blast

My only beef is you have to play it through in order to use the cheat available and many of us play a game once and thats it

Other than that not a single complaint  This game freaking rocks  Tons of different monstersfoes tons of cool weapons level upon level of varying backgrounds  Too me back to the old days of all the Doom games

So if youre feeling nostalgic and want to play an FSP that doesnt require you to evolve three extra fingers on each hand dig this one back up or buy it dirt cheap here on Amazon  You wont regret itYes Quake II the game PC owners have been enjoying for a long time has finally made it to the PlayStation Being a fan of PC firstperson shooters I was less than excited I mean Ive already played the singleplayer to death on the PC and multiplayer FPS games on a console are usually quite pathetic The N version was pretty good provided that you could look past the flaws that most fans of the PC version would notice in the first  seconds The PlayStation version has many of these same flaws but given the PlayStations rapidly aging hardware its easier to overlook these flaws While you may not remain interested in the singleplayer mission to see it to its completion the fourplayer multiplayer in Quake II will make you glad you had picked up a multitap and three extra Dual Shocks The storyline is your typical hostile alien sort of thing You as a space marine land on the planet of Stroggos with the intention of blowing up everything in sight Unfortunately you get separated from the rest of the marines and are forced to go it alone So now you must run all over this planet collecting keys opening doors taking elevators and wiping out various alien monsters before they tear you in half To wipe out these aliens youll have to find weapons  your wimpy default blaster simply wont cut it Youll find a couple shotguns two types of machine guns a grenade launcher a rocket launcher and two types of energy weapons  one of which is the almighty BFG a gun that spits out a huge power ball and wipes out just about anything that gets near the blast Youll also find a great deal of ammo armor and health scattered about the levels A game like this really requires a good control scheme to succeed Thanks to excellent use of the Dual Shock controller it has one In the default setup you use the left stick to look around and the four buttons on the front of the pad to move in any of four directions You can also configure the right analog stick so you can use it in much the same way The R buttons handle firing and jumping and the L buttons let you cycle through your weaponry You can play the game on a standard controller but trust me  you wouldnt want to The game also supports the PlayStation mouse but if youre already used to using a mouse to control your firstperson shooters then you probably have a PC and youve been playing the PC version of Quake II for ages making this game mostly useless Graphically the PlayStation really does a decent job The textures may look a little washedout a few models may have been simplified and a few frames of animation may have been chopped here and there but overall the game runs at a very playable speed The tradeoff is that the game has much more frequent loads Most of the level modification between the PC and PlayStation versions is in the addition of many more small closedoff hallways that serve as little loading areas At first its not a big deal but when youve got to go back and forth between different parts of a level to accomplish various tasks loading every  seconds is enough to make you crazy The games sound effects and music are taken directly from the PC version and overall the sound is great
The multiplayer mode is where this title picks up most of its value points Sure a few of the multiplayer levels are a little on the weak side but there are enough good ones that it doesnt really matter The three modes in the game are standard deathmatch team deathmatch and versus Versus mode is a lastmanstanding affair where you and up to three friends duke it out until only one of you remains The coolest multiplayer option is the gravity slider which lets you turn gravity way down for some really highflying action or turn it way up to keep people from hopping around like lunatics Sure its not as versatile as being able to program your own modifications to the game but its a nice touch and it manages to breathe a bit of life into the game In the end the PlayStation version of Quake II falls under the same disclaimers as most other PCtoconsole firstperson shooters  if you own the PC version dont waste your time But if youre looking for some good splitscreen shooting action with a decent singleplayer mode to back it up this version will make your dayThis is an expansion pack to Baldurs Gate it is an addin and it does not expand the original plot There are three new areas that your party can explore The experience point cap is also up to  in this game making it possible to gain  or  more levels depending on your class
The three addin areas are Ulgoths Beard a small town north of Baldurs Gate where more or less all the expansion adventures take their start from anislandtrying not to reveal too much and Durlags Tower Of these Durlags Tower is the most challenging and interesting Durlags tower is the biggest dungeon in the entire game and can be a challenge for even experienced parties The other areas offer some interesting information but are less exiting to play through All in all it is an interesting expansion although not an expansion in the true sense of the word But since you can sometimes find both Baldurs Gate and Tales of the Sword Coast in one package at a good price there is no excuse not to get itIm surprised at the number of reviewers who found this game disappointing  I found it to be a challenging expansion pack that significantly raises the difficulty level over that of the original  No Tales of the Sword Coast doesnt extend the story line of BG and no the story line doesnt even FIT comfortably within the original BG plot  And yes Tales IS basically  an addon that simply allows your characters to increase their experience points and find new items in the process
Still I think it is a fault to criticize the game too much as many customer reviewers have on issues of story line  If you want a great involved story well buy Planescape Torment my vote for greatest RPG title ever  Even though Tales of the Sword Coasts game objectives may seem completely out of whack with the BG main plot think back to BG and I think youll recall LOTS of areas that didnt have anything to do with the iron shortage or Saverok  For instance did the Firewine Dungeon really play a crucial role in terms of story line  Did helping Drizzt fight off those hordes of baddies really advance the plot  How about all the random quests
In other words I think one should evaluate TOSC using one simple maxim as a guide namely are the new areas fun to play  In my opinion the new areas in TOSC are both challenging and enjoyable  One of the levels BEWARE SPOILERS HERE the ice island is a throwaway but the other two Werewolf Island and Durlags Tower are impressive  Werewolf Island does have a captivating plot and although its size in terms of area isnt large the battles are numerous and semidifficult  Durlags Tower provides players with something that BG kind of lacked  a decent dungeon crawl  I found Durlags Tower very involving and moderately difficult  Unlike the ridiculous monster count and borderline unplayability in terms of difficulty of Icewind Dales dungeons Durlags Tower strikes a nice balance between being difficult but not too difficult it knows how to challenge players without forcing them to die reload die reolad die reload ad infinitum
Lastly I found this game a decent value in terms of length  TOSC is now a bargain bin purchase and although some customers here like to brag lie about how the game only took them  hours to complete Tales took me betwen  and  weeks to finish  I admit that I may not be a master ADD player yet I did successfully complete BG and felt that my party was very much up to the challenge of the expansion pack
This game does get docked a notch however for some small problems  Pathfinding is still troublesome   Inventory juggling is still a nightmare  I truly believe that about  of Baldurs Gate and this expansion is spent juggling inventory items   The puzzle element introduced in Durlags Tower is more annoying than fun   The nexttofinal battle against a monster summoned with Durlags Blade is insanely difficult and convoluted  But basically if you enjoyed the original you should probably enjoy this expansionI would have given this game  stars were it not so blatantly hateful of Republicans The last portion of the game gave the character no option but to spew venom hate and lies about Republicans I only finished the game anyway because I had already bought it and thrown away the receipt Otherwise I would have returned it

In the future with regards to the rumoured upcoming Fallout  I will keep the receipt and do internet research about that game before deciding to keep it for good

While fatally flawed by its undisguised bias the game in its time was excellent The mixture of realistic weapon sex graphic violence post apocalyptic storyline and rpg elements make this an almost great game

The graphics were quite dated and the sound effects often cut out but this was not the games fault I bought this game long after its time Unsurprisingly the intervening years since the games first release saw graphics and sound standards rise dramatically My soundcard also was not supported for by the game Again not surprising and not at all the games faultOh how I love this game one of the most underrated RTS games Ive played Underrated because the original version of the game had major problems and because the second game in the series seals the series doom it isnt very good

I havent played the original MechCommander nonGold game Apparently complaints were aimed mostly at the interface and the fact that it was too hard and there were no artillery strikes As artillery strikes are my favorite single aspect of the game I would recommend that you avoid the original and only get MechCommander Gold but be warned This is a hard game Winnable but hard One reason is that there is no ingame saveability Like the original Rainbow Six game you play through from one scenario to the next with no way to save midgame However there are some strategic tools you can use that most games dont afford One is pausing the game You can view different parts of the map issue commands to Mechs and even send artillery strikes all while the game is paused Youll need to use this Another strategic ace is the refit truck If you have a refit truck available and its a hard level youll do fine The ability to restore damaged Mechs ingame with a refit truck is as close to cheating as you can get

Some of the highpoints of the game

Strategy There is actual thought and timing required to win whether its scouting with a light jumpable Mech with long range radar or just rolling through en masse or burning your way through a forest to avoid bad guys This is pure combat no resource gathering and such like most RTS games where the economics are far more important in determining the winner than military might Dont get me wrong I love the economic side of RTS games but MechCommander is a nice departure from that Also the look of the game is terrific Its nice to look at This game is twodimensional with an isometric view The second MechCommander is threedimensional and looks like crud Rise of Nations while it has some threedimensional elements is twodimesional and isometric Please let that be the trend Even Warcraft III while threedimensional keeps a steady nonrotating view of the landscape This is the correct way to do it The sound is pretty good although you do get tired of hearing the same messages of acknowledgement and the fact that the MechWarriors have something on their radar You kind of get used to it and ignore it At least the voices are all different so you can usually distinguish whos talking

Its a blast to customize the mechs with whatever weapons you find and even better to salvage enemy mechs which always have a slight advantage in firepower and speed Theres nothing quite like mousing over a storage bin and seeing the contextsensitive cursor change into a pair of pliers or whatever they are indicating that theres something to get in there

Oh and jumpjets are just plain cool Man I love this game Plus the cinematics at the beginning feature the same guy who starred in a fairly recent snowmobile commercial featuring the automatic jerkyextruder The acting on both occasions is hilarious A little bonus tidbit of trivia thereFallout II while falling short of the original Fallout or the squad based Fallout Tactics is still a fantastic game definitely worth a look It plays similar to the first installment but boasts better graphics and richer character dialogues The two things going for it I recommend purchasing the dual package which contains both Fallout I  Fallout II It is worht the price for the first alone and the second is a nice bonus Four stars highly recommendedI wasent as inpressed with this game as I thought I would be  First of all the load times are forever  Second  this game has cartoon graphics  Theird  I hate the street fighters in this game Forth I love the xmen they are absolutly fabulusYes Fallout  is one of the best RPG games out there especially considering the fact that there are no futuristic RPGs in the current market  However this game requires way to much search and talk  It gets  very old very quickly and you will find yourself with the best equipment  on the planet by simply waiting for two different parties to kill each  other  I had a flamethrower within one hour of playing that made me nearly  invincible  I mean come on  Unless you are going to play this game  without accepting help from NPCs this really proves no challenge and  damages the fun factor  At least the price is rightWell here I am Making a review of a game made in the mid s in this year  What can i say This bring backs amazing memories

I could remember the time i went to the arcade with a friend I found this game and i just HAD to play it The graphics were weak in the arcade but then they had it on ps which the graphics are much better  I wont say this is the best game i ever played but hey its not fair comparing a s game to a current SO lets just put it this way because Im bored

Graphics 
Sounds 
Controlls

Overall 

Ill recommend this to anyone whos enjoying classic games or is a street fighter fan or to anyone who likes fighting games

 A noobI like the game very much it was a lot of fun it was difficult but I will get better at it and I will find woody cant waitThis game is very different from any other Play Station game But that doesnt mean it is dumb When I first played it it was hard But when you really get into it You will be stuck on that game Its very addicting I recommend this game to anyone who likes a great adventureI fell in love with this game because of its simple interface  Memorize a few button presses and you can be putting songs together in no time  Pick from hundreds of melodies bass lines drum parts  sound effects and percussion samples and paste them together to make a song  Its that easy  You can even create your own riff if youve got the patience for it  Then you can even create your own music video to along with your song
  This game did not recieve as much attention as it should have but I strongly reccomend it  The only two flaws are the slowdown that occurs from time to time especially during the video editing and the songs take up an enormous amount of space on your memory cardsMonopoly on the Nintendo  is great Most people just say all it is is boring ol Monopoly To be honest its not I never got bored while playing this game It has so much appeal The graphics are great the music is solid the gameplay is fun even if youre playing against the computer The only reasons I gave it  stars is that all it is well is just Monopoly If they added more stuff I would love it even more

Allinall its underrated Its definitely worth a purchaseThis is a terrific game for children who love the Toy Story films  All the regular characters make appearances and its just too fun controlling Buzz Lightyear  I only wish the graphics sound and control were a bit more polished  The dificulty comes mainly from a constantly moving camera but you can fix it when needed and a bit too loose control  For the younger gamers though these drawbacks wont matter much as its fun just wondering around the levels and finding your friends  You get to explore Andys house Als Toy Barn and an airport among others  Older and more experienced gamers will probably want to pass on this due to the laskluster graphics and unsophicated gameplay  But if youre a fan as much as I am then youll be able to look past these drawbacks and enjoy the game  One thing to keep in mind is that to save your game you need to have a controller packI like it I beat it little replay value  Better then expected  In fact its one of the best games for the Nintendo  the first time aroundgame was in good conditions for a childhood game WARNING you have to buy a game pack memory card for N if you dont already own one it does not save and youll have to start all over again if you dont save your progress other than thatget itThis is one of the best kids video games i ever played The graphics were pretty good for the n The things you have to do are a little challenging but not to hard I dont know why it labeled as a kids game just because it based off a kids movie Its a great game for kids and adults The only thing that is frustrating is that its one of those n games that actually needs a memory card Other then that its a great game and a must have if you want a fun game and are a fan of the movieThis is a great game to play with a friend or two or more Its still fun to play it by yourself but its definately better as a multiplayer game This game is pretty addicting so if you have alot of time to kill this is the perfect game for you Hopefully there will be an upgraded version for this on the Playstation  but I highly recommend this gameAlready has all the elements that will make bg series such an absolute game To play preferably using bg  engine or wait for the bg enhanced edition Pure role playing Try it if you esp if you like the genreWellI must say that this game is just that its not the best game ever but it is really fun and youll play it a lot supposing you like DDADD or RPGs  That being said allow me to get to the nitpicky stuff
One major gripe with this game that I have is teh experience system  It divides up the experience rather then give each party member an exact copy of the amount recieved  Another problem is the amount of Cosmetic strikes and how you miss a lot  I guess that is for realism but it just annoys me Also sometimes the game is REALLY nonlinear so you have to get a guide or talk to EVERYONE in a place to see where you need to go
Other than that this game is really good and will keep you playing it forever  The story is really good and the rest of the game is good I will not spill details although most of you have already gotten the game and beaten it  Well i must go hope you enjoyed the reviewThis game is loooong I really enjoy long games but this a bit much for me Of course if I could play more than two or three hours a week Things I didnt like not escaping though cutscenes not automatically reloading the last quicksave and less reputation comments from your NPCs  Highly recommended and a must have for any RPG fanI bought Baldurs Gate after  friends kept telling me how great it was Im not a big RPG player however I did find this to be a truly great game

Positive features of the game Visually the game is quite well done especially the scenary and spell effects  The atmosphere can get quite spooky in underground caverns and during thunderstorms  There is a lot of flexibility when it comes to character creation and one is even allowed to doubleclass and choose their characters appearance  The NPCs can be quite engaging and party members you can have up to  actually interact with each other verbally in often humorous dialogue  The storyline is interesting and generally linear though there are many subquests that one can choose to pursue

  Regarding the down side of the game By the time the game got to chapter  there are  I was ready for it to end  And the ending itself is a bit anticlimactic  My party got up to only th level and thus had rather limited abilities  Comparing this game to Morrowind which I am now playing BG could have been a bit more openended and expansive in size which would have enhanced its replayability  After  intense days of playing to the end I promptly auctioned it on Ebay

  For those interested in a welltold gorgeously rendered DDstyle adventure with a welldefined main plot and credible monsters and NPCs BG is a good buy

Rating  starsBaldurs Gate was the game that mannaged to blow new life into computer roleplaying games For those of you not familiar with roleplaying games or the ADD rules here is a short introduction You start out with creating your character selecting a racedwarf human halfling gnome elf and halfelfand a professionFighter mage clericpriest ranger etc etc Then you roll up your ability scores each representing one physical or mental ability strength dexterity constitution intelligence wisdom and charisma After creating your character you start the game in Candlekeep a keep located on the swordcoast famous for its library You are an orphan raised by your ward Gorion The start of the game is easy and not very challenging but it does give you time to get into the game mechanics and there are several tutors in Candlekeep that can give you advice on the game I will avoid going into any further detail about the game plot as it will ruin the joy of the game
The game itself features a linear story line but with a lot of subquests some minor and some larger There are plenty of areas for your party to explore but beware some of the areas might prove more than you can handle in the lower levels As the plot thickens and you find out more about your background and the powers working against you it becomes more interesting and you find yourself working towards the grand finale
The graphics are fine considering the game isnt new anymore This is truly an entertaining game with only a few flawsflaws that I only noticed after playing Baldurs Gate II Shadows of Amn The character interaction in the group is almost nonexistant and it would have been nice with a little more ingroub dialogue There are plenty of characters that you can have join your groupalmost too many Sometimes you are really have doubts about who you want since you are limited to a total of  membersincluding yourself Even with the limited NPCNonPlayerCharacter interaction most NPCs are still very different and have good developed personalities
The main plot is really good intrigue based although it seems that at some point you find yourself a bit lost in all the subquests and explorable areas there are that you almost lose sight of the real goal of the game
That said it is still a great game Most importantly it mannages to get the ADD feeling to the computer almost like the real thing The AI does not always work as it should though and you might find your characters blocking your path so you are suddenly stuck in a small area and need to reload This can be annoying but knowing the danger of this happening can help you avoid it
A note this game is very different from games like Diablo and Diablo II none of which were true roleplaying games If you are looking for a way to hack and slash your way to glory this is not the game for you There is a need to interact with other people during the game and the way you behave and answer them will affect their reaction towards you unlike Diablo where everything is a monologue If you ever played and enjoyed tabletop ADD this will almost certainly entertain you If you never tried ADD this might just get you introduced
I propably would have given this game  stars but since I played Baldurs Gate II Shadows of Amn I have chosen to limit myself to  stars as there are a lot of things that are enhanced in SoAThis game is wonderful Customizing my character was very entertaining and one of things I enjoy the most about RPGs and the small side quests are numerous and interesting There any many areas that serve no particular purpose other than to gain some XP doing quests This I think is a weakness of the succeeding games in the BG series there are not enough exploration options available The possibilites of your party are nearly endless since there are many NPCs all of whom have their own strengths However there is little NPC interaction which is disappointing There are some annoying aspects of gameplay which is what caused me to downgrade this game slightly such as the fact that the characters are excruciatingly slow and have a poor pathfinder feature which leaves them w a tendency to go places other than where you planned You will be challenged from the first shocking event to the final showdownand you will enjoy it the entire wayBaldurs Gate is probably one of the better role playing games on the market today It has some good characters along with a riviting story line that will keep you hooked as you play it The music is great and the graphics are very good for a computer game There is a wide list of characters and NPCs that will help your character on their quest And the best part of this game is that the controls are actually easy to use so you arent stressing yourself out to looking for the right buttons to use in your battles I rate this game at  stars because it could be a little longer and a little better but for  it is definately a game worth buyingThe itme is very good all mat fun for kids  and the game is clean then once more i thank youthis game just annoys me to the point i dont want to play it the term Metroidvania doesnt do it justice if anything it insults the Metroid name because everything in Metroid is about exploration and everything is deliberate SotN just teases you in the first part of the game and annoys you all together so at the start you play as Richter Belmont picking up from Rondo of Blood or Dracula X in the west you reach Dracula and enters chessy voice acting so your like oh ok i can dig this but youre already fighting dracula so what else is there to fight fast forward a couple of years and now enters Alucard running through the forest and jumps the gate awesome scene now your in control and this guy has a powerful weapon and armor so everything just dies in one hit yeah just as powerful as Richter then its taken away from you that is so not cool why the big tease where in development they thought was a good idea to show players Alucards powerful equipment then have it taken away  then the sense of direction oh my god after that big tease you follow the path and then after a while you explore but you cant because you need a relic to open blue door but you need to find the relic but you dont know where to find it you find those relics laying around only that they supposed to be in the game already not a fudging relic to show enemies names or the damage its cryptic and its not known where to go then the spells its never told that you can cast spells to gain small health and summon a spirit however moving away from the negatives i will say that the soundtrack is amazing and the graphics have aged well its an ok title much like Simons Quest this game isnt for everyone and im almost done playing the game and i feel ive wasted so much time getting lost i just want to fight Dracula and get it over with thats the point isnt to get lost waste time get powerful and then comes the endgame boss your pretty powerful already so youll be disappointed on how the boss fight came out

overall its an ok title but to me its just more annoying than fun im already level  and majority of the boss fights are becoming easy but im nearly done with the game so i have to beat it now its a game that just wastes you time all games are but this one and simons quest just literally wastes your time like no other the portable games of Castlevania follow this formula now which is disappointing just try this game out for  minutes then youll see what im taking about its also an XBLA title so you can find it pretty easy or pay for a PS titleThe Good Fast fun gameplay nice graphical style some of the best video game music ever created long good story

The Bad Extreme difficulty can really turn some people away the age here shows quite a bit

I never played this game before until now I was too young at the time to really understand the game Now that Ive played it I understand why it got its praise and I dont understand at the same time What really makes me not like this game as much as other people is the extreme difficulty Either that or I just suck at the game Im not really good at D platformers to begin with but this game does deliver on all accounts

It has a great story great graphics fast fun gameplay you can equip stuff on every body part you have ahem you can buy things While Im not a huge Castlevania fan to begin with first CV ever was Lament of Innocence PS Im not saying this game is terrible but for me the difficulty was way too hard for me I just couldnt get past the third stageIll state from the outset that my background in RPGs is limited  Sure I had friends who would gather together on Friday or Saturday nights to play pen and paper DD but I was never among them  Occasionally however I did enjoy playing computerbased Roleplaying games the three Bards Tale adventures
I say all this in an effort to convince nonADD people or nonRPG players out there to give Baldurs Gate a chance  Yes ADD rules are numerous and complicated I have no idea for instance what D means but dont worry too much because the computer takes care of all this for you  Essentially youll encounter enemies youll push your spacebar to pause the action and point and click directing your party members how and whom to attack  The computer calculates all the dierolling stuff  You just sit back and watch the blood fly  This is not to say however that BG is a brainless game  In fact youll learn quickly that Fools Rush In if you dont think about battle strategy  Put simply Baldurs Gate achieves a perfect balance it both satisfies hardcore DD folk who have long clamored for an accurate PC RPG experience while also not scaring away newbies
This is not to say that BG doesnt take some learning  The manual is thick and at times confusing particularly in how to memorize spells  There are lots of options in BG so youll have to become familiar with the game interface and inventory system  Be prepared to spend several hours just getting comfortable with how the game operates  Also be prepared to die a lot in the beginning
Once youve mastered the controls this game gets addictive and fast  BG is now an older title and with BGII having been out now for over half a year the original is currently a bargain bin purchase  I bought my copy through an online auction for eight bucks  Those eight dollars provided me with six weeks of constant gameplaying  Most action games can be completed in less than a week but BG was vast and involving  The world is huge and sprawling side quests are seemingly infinite and replay value is a bonus
So why four stars  Well like many people I have my subjective nitpicky problems  First the pathfinding is pretty weak  Its mostly okay when youre out in the open but in dungeons the pathfinding is flatout horrible  I barely escaped the Firewine dungeon alive because whenever Id get into a battle and order my commands my party members would then stupidly go off in six separate and unexpected directions  Second although the world is huge it does get tedious trudging across the BG map  At times the game can feel like a chore to explore that unnamed wilderness section thats located leagues away from where you truly need to go only because well you feel there might be something interesting there  Third going up levels takes a long time  Dont get me wrong I realize that going up levels shouldnt be too easy to accomplish but its kind of disheartening to only be a level seven fighter at the end of the game because theres an experience point cap of  with thirtyodd hit points  Either raise the cap or make level limits a bit lower  Lastly although hardcore gamers may love the myriad spells weapons and potions I felt there were too many  Your party members dont have many slots for carrying items and all those items you find during your travels potions in particular become annoying should I use suchandsuch potion immediately should I save it for a big battle should I sell it and make money should I simply leave it behind
Still despite the quirks Ive never been so deeply involved in a PC game and Im looking forward to my next purchases Icewind Dale and BGIIWhen I first picked it up I thought it would end up just being another throw away
I WAS WRONG  fun game your actions change the story an how others will interact with you Download a few add on  utilities for this an you will become a GODlol
I would have given this a  but they need to change up that ending a bitkinda goes to fast After this game I played Diablo Diablo is not a bad gamebut Baldurs Gate makes it look like Pong This is the best ADD game ivve ever played and I play a lot
Baldurs Gate is about a kid played by you who grows up in Candle keepunder the kind tutelage of his foster fatherGorion After a couple of years growing upGorion wants to move away You dont know why In about  minutes into the game thats how long it took meGorion gets killed in a horrid battle by mercenaries You must avenge him Butafter traveling and making friends and making enemiesyou find out your dark secret
Very addictive game Yet the computer was going through hell Thats the only problem
Buy this if you liked LotrLord of the RingsSymphony of the Night is considered the pinnacle of the Castlevania series and with good reason  At a time when sidescrollers were falling to full D games Konami proved that there was still room for a good D game in the gaming industry
Symphony boasts impressive environments huge bosses multiple endings creepy music and more weapons and items than you can shake a stick at  My only problem is that its just too much for me to rememberwhen Im being mauled by Beezlebub is not the time to look up the Dark Metamorphosis spell  If you take the time to learn all your spells as well as the insandouts of all the Familiars though you wont have that big a problem
I have just a few picks about the game
 As stated before the inventoryspell system is HUGE and can be intimidating
 Voice acting  Aughh  Wish there was an option to turn the original Japanese voice acting on like you can in Lament of Innocence
 Bosses  Bosses are typically easy provided you have enough healthrestore items  However I frequntly found myself being turned into a bloody pulp literally by the sheer numbers and strength of ordinary enemiesisnt it suppossed to be the BOSSES who kill you over and over again
Dont get me wrong Symphony is one of the best Castlevania titles to datebut if youre looking for a more userfriendly Castlevania game I suggest Aria of Sorrow for the Game Boy AdvanceThis is an interesting title I never got into it that far but it is  pretty cool Very difficult Beware not for amateur gamers I can get about   hours in and half my men die I dont like when that happens but you got  live I guess eh Good luck if you choose this titleHey I remember the old goldladen boxes for the first ADD games by  SSI back when the C was still a great computer and Im here to tell you  this is a vast improvment Overall the game is well drawn with decent sound  and standard voice acting  Many elements of the pencil and paper game a  found here with some annoying omissions that will be fixed in the next  installment  These were the low experience cap and inability to distribute  weapon slots towards twoweapon style to name a couple  At any rate the  game is LOADED with subquests and days of good solid gameplay  Black Isle  is on a rollTheres no other way to put it there has been no other game Ive ever played in my life where Ive wanted to play the game from the beginning over and over as I did with CastlevaniaSOTN Sure I beat it countless times but from beginning to end is just so much fun its unbelieveable The game is SUPER DEEP youll never use EVERY special trick no matter how long and how many times you play this game The graphics are spectacular for D the music is the best of any game Ive ever played why no soundtrack available
So why not  stars It hurts me to not give it  stars but I have to be honest the games kinda easy sure its super long but back in the day of the old castlevania games they were just so challenging in terms of obstacles and amount of enemies But with this game with all the save spots free extra health and lack of extremely hard obstacles its kinda hard to die Although if it had been that hard then I probably wouldnt be playing it over and over again Lets say  stars
One more thing if you go through the entire castle and beat Belmont dont think youre done yet youve still got a whole other castle to conquerOne of the things that always made DD annoying for me to play was that the GM could rarely be completely cold and fair in regards to die rolls  sometimes the GM would pick a favorite class or a favorite PC and  theyd always come out better than others  Well in Baldurs Gate the GM  is the computer so everything is fair and impartial
On the singleplayer  aspect the game is fun  You can be whatever type of person you want to be  and do whatever you want  You can be a noble paladin ot a scoundrel  thief its up to you  As you progress through the game you gain  experience and abilities and learn more and more about why people are  hunting you
On multiplayer it can be fun if you have the right group  The story is the same as it is in singleplayer except one member of your  party is the main character while the rest of the group are backups  If  you have a group with enough imagination you can have a game that lives up  to any tabletop DD game
In actual gameplay a lot of what you do is  travel from place to place and quest  Sometimes you encounter people who  want to talk to you and sometimes you run into a pack of monsters to kill  The interface reminds me a bit of Diablo but the games are not clones of  each other I assure you
Although the game is slightly buggy that  cleared right up with a patch  I also like the ability to customize your  character portraits and sounds it makes the roleplaying aspect all the  more realKingpin Life of Crime is a dark fps with a great gameplay set in the real bad world You play a unnamed guy just called Thug The game opens with thug badly beaten up and left in an ally by Nicks men Nick works for the kingpin Thug vows to get revenge but he does not have anything besides a small pipe so he has to kill people for money he kills people takes their money and weapons buys more weapons hires goons rides on a stolen bike jumps into a moving train finally he takes on the kingpin kills him and he becomes the kingpin The single player gameplay is a different and great experience no boss levels all the villans are humans but their weapons and toughness changes Besides shooting the baddies you have to talk and get advise from people in night clubs visit the pawn o matic hire goons ect The level design is fantastic From a dark ally a steel mill railroad bad streets ect They are very fun and very enjoyable to get through The level are huge and are in hub layout The weapons are good There is a pistol shotgun tommygun grenade launcher bazzoka and a flame thrower The flame thrower looks as good as it is in rtcw This same company did rtcw
Kingpin is built on the heavily modified quake engine I play it on the default OpenGL video mode and the game runs very smooth The graphics are fantastic look great even today The charecter animation is good but thier flesh moves as if they do not have any skeleton Sound is very good weapon sounds and the music is great The voice acting is averange and almost all the male charecters sound the same The art direction for each levels is superb artists who did it should get an award for their contribution kingpin has the best art direction in a computer game even today Wow fantastic environments look real and the atmosphere is superb Kingpin is a very violent game you could see arms and limbs comming off baddies injured and running away will leave a trail of blood the level of violace and langauge make games like sof look like a kids game you can reduce them by installing the pg version There are lots of bad words you will hear the fword hundred times in the first level itself The AI is quite good villans react well in situation Kingpin is a very good game If you do not mind games with heavy violance and bad words then you will surely like it It is one of the realistic and coolest fps i have ever playedThe first Zork game done by Activision was Return to Zork which looked cheap in many spots and although had some innovations it wasnt very impressive  Next was Zork Nemesis which was worlds better but also very  dark and serious  The only thing that made it a Zork game were a few  familiar names and locations thrown around  It lacked the humor of a true  Zork game
Grand Inquisitor is both high quality and a true Zork game  The humor is there familiar locations are there and the mood is most  assuredly Zork  From a Brogmoid eating rocks to shoving a river raft in a  dragons nose to getting a house drunk the game is pure Zork  humor
The visuals are from first person perspective much like Myst and  Riven with video of various characters CGI and live action interspersed  throughout  Its a  CD game with one Cd devoted to being above ground and  the other below  As an added bonus you can also play ZGI in multiplayer  As far as I know this is the only multiplayer first person adventure game  in existance
The premise is that magic has been banned by the Grand  Inquisitor and the head wizard has been trapped in a lantern  Said lantern  makes interesting wisecracks as you play Your sword is blowing glue  I mean er glowing blue and helps keep a light edge to it  all
If you like the humor of Monkey Island and are a fan of zork youll  enjoy this game or even if you just want to play an adventure game with a  light mood and good quality graphicsI noticed a previous reviewer said you really need a fast system to play BZ Well I am playing on a mhz pent  megs ram Voodoo  and with a kbs internet connection speed and it is smooth as silk with every  feature turned up and using X res He must have alot of stuff running  in the background Well enough of that The single player game has great  graphics and good strategy gameplay I find the storyline a bit weak  though The multiplayer portion needs some work Ping times are extremely  high and it is hard to get into a lowsub  ping room They really need  to fix that portion While I am not quite as impressed as with the first  BZ is still a good game to keep you glued to your monitor for hoursThis game is one of the best out there as far as graphics are concerned  With real voices and great graphics gameplay is one of the best of its kind  I would suggest this to anyone who has a D Graphics card it will definitely make the experience a lot betterWhat are you prepared to do
Pros
Very enjoyable game
Pretty good graphicsdespite eyes are white
 fatalities a pop more than mortal combat
Very good rap tracks
good voice acting in FMVs
Devistating combos that can dish out mad damage
Rage meter definitly helps
Suprisingly good for a game that didnt get much praise from sites
Cons
Story mode especially in China gets real repetitive
Some fatalities stinklike decks first fatalitiy
Ghost and Masta dont support their voices
I never herd of this game until my brother brought it over and I was hooked  I got everything for him and yet he didnt even let me borrow the gameOne stingy brother  But I got it not far after and now Im still enjoying it from time to time  If you love mortal Combat or like wutang this is sure not to dissapoint
Final WordsThis game is definitly a game that lives up to not only the wutang name but a mortal kombat with a Tekken style looking game  And thats what also cought my eye as well
Peacespace invaders for the n does a great job of taking something old and making it new again the game is good and but it still only provides little variance on the space invaders formula if you like space invaders though this game gives further depth to the original i would recommend this game to anyone familiar with the original if not dont botherWarCraft  is a legendary game made by Blizzard a big gaming company as of now  The game when it came out had everything and was a start of a brand new kind of game play  Now with THIS edition though you can play on  the internet which was something many people wanted for some time  The  races of  arnt nearly as strategic as StarCraft its following great  achiever due to the facts that the Orcs and Humans in the game play are  almost identical  The only real difference is the spells and the way the  units look
There is  reasons that I think you should buy this over  StarCraft One is that it has two GREAT previews of the upcoming game  WarCraft  and the game Diablo   The other reason is that not everyone  can afford computers that are incredibly fast  So if you can not play  StarCraft very quickly and it goes slow on bnet for you then WarCraft is  something you must buy because it will work much more effectivelyRailroad Tycoon II is the  sequel to the  classic Sid Meiers Railroad Tycoon Even though Sids name has jumped ship this is a solid sequel to a great game The premise is simple enough Build a railroad buy some trains ship stuff from where it is to where its needed Get rich
From humble concepts mighty games are grown and enriching this basic idea are things like train quality which forces you to choose between cost fast good on slopes or reliable keeping demand high by supplying only small amounts versus the cost of connecting other places where demand is high short routes with small payloads and fast turnarounds versus long routes with big payloads buying and selling stocks to take advantage of economic trends buying the businesses whose materials youre transporting defending against train robbers or hiring shady characters and exploiting legal loopholes and so on
Basically this premise works and supplies hours of good addictive fun Theres a lot of replay value as well since you can take a different approach to each game The graphics are still even in  pleasant and communicative and the sound is mostly good The scenarios are pretty challenging without for the most part being crushingly hard and the three levels of victories encourages replay as you try to go for the gold
The are a number of hitches unfortunately The manual and tutorial are really inadequatewhich tends to sting given that most of the fansupplied data on the Web is gone The supplyanddemand process is actually somewhat opaque I did figure it out but it took me a while and some research on the net Your board of directors is very gullible not able to look ahead even a month this makes them easy to manipulate The stock market stuff makes it easy to lose with a thriving railroad and doesnt add much to the game that Ive experienced
Further trains really only go from point A to point B That is say you have cattle yard B that needs grain and two grain farms A and A that supply grain you cant set up a train to pick up grain at A travel to A to pick up more grain and then travel to B to drop it off When the train stops its completely unloaded This is never spelled out anywhere and certain ways of setting up a trains route suggest otherwise But in the above situation your train will actually unload grain at a grain farm for no money rather than haul it another ten miles to the cattle yard where its actually needed
The scale of the game is such that each train moves about thth of its actual speed In other words a trip that should take a week takes a year This is probably a necessary abstractiontrainmodel fans will want to keep in mind that this game has NOTHING to do with their hobby but it has the effect of exaggerating every mistake or mishap Jesse James didnt just rob a single train he robbed your entire route for the year
All of this detracts a bit but its a testament to the strength of the concept and execution that this would still be a fivestar game even with these issues The killerthe thing that made me subtract a staris the tracklaying interface Its really easy to lay track you didnt mean to Theres no undo It actually costs you to remove it The way the UI figures out the smoothest route is dubious and theres really no decent handling for the fact that finding the smoothest track is best done at the closest zoom while finding the shortest route is best done at the furthest zoom
Coupled with some bugs that make stations seem disconnected you can end up in a situation where you lose a game because the tracklaying interface was not up to the task And thats the only real sour lemon in this package Again though even with this theres still a lot of fun
Itll definitely whet your apetite for Railroad Tycoon I just got the game a few days ago included in a value pack I am currently playing the campaigns and so far I am enjoying the game Even my husband is playing it
Pros Sim type game
Different type of trains and several campaigns which I love
Is challenging for an average game player dont know about hardcore players
Cons The game tutorial was okay but wish I could find a way to start back at the beginning of it When my husband wanted to play I had to tell him how to do it instead of him doing the tutorial because it wouldnt start back at the beginning
Other than that I dont know of any other cons since I have just started playing and havent started the scenerios
You do get tired of laying down tracks all the time and have to zoom in and out
So far I am really enjoying itPros
 This game is exactly like being in the middle of a Star Trek episode You play a Star Fleet Cadet whos father was killed during the Borg encounter at Wolf  You are offered the chance to go back in time shortly before the battle to see if you can change history As soon as you accept the challenge you are transported to the bridge of a starship as the crew prepares to engage the Borg You have the uncanny poignant experience of watching the father you scarcely knew as he interacts with his shipmates tries to save his friends and bravely prepares for a battle he is doomed to lose
 I havent played many Full Motion Video FMV games but I thought this one was very well done The acting is as good as that on any Star Trek episode the Borg are horrifying and menacing and Q is in magnificent form as usual It was great fun to have Q chastise and insult you in the same sarcastic way he uses with Picard or Janeway
 The puzzles are wellintegrated into the story and allow you to use some of the equipment and consoles that youve always wanted to try I did not consider the bulk of the puzzles to be particularly difficult although they do require some outofthebox thinking There are lots of alternate endings in this game most of them start with your demise after which there is a commentary from Q as to the efficacy of your efforts
Cons
 The game plays a lot like a movie with certain decision points at which you choose how to act these moments are clearly signaled in the game There were enough of these to make it feel pretty interactive but not nearly so many as in a traditional graphic adventure
 When a decision point occurs the game will not respond if you click too quickly In order for your decision to register you must hold the mouse down firmly for a second or two
 I would have liked the game to be a little longer though in the ongoing tension between length and quality Ill take quality any day Actually I would have liked the game to be a LOT longer Truthfully I would have liked the game never to end
Bottom Line A MustHave for any Trekker or anyone who enjoys FMV adventuresPros
Priced right at just  for jewel case
Still very popular with hundreds of potential opponents online
Balanced weaponry no one unit or structure rules
Huge variety of maps and missions
Easy to use map editor
Additional games online such as capture the flag
Game rarely lags or runs choppy even with v and v games
Doesnt require much computer or a top video card
Everything is on just one disc
Cons
Cartoonish graphics are a bit dated
Gameplay while easy to learn can be tiring and out dated
Over all warcraft  is still a great game and loads of fun I had known about this game for a long time and finally decided to pick up the  version which also provides you with a strategy guide An exellent value I heartily recommend this game because you know what youre getting The concept is ok with the humans v the orcs but almost all my time with this game is one on one multiplayer You dont have to go to battlenetcom you can also play a buddy modem to modem How you begin the game depends on the map but usually you start with one peon or builder and a certain amount of resources You will always need a certain number of farms to feed your people as well as a steady supply of gold and wood Wood is everywhere but there are a limited number of gold mines and it is around these that you will build your camps Most of your military will come from a barricks and you make more peons from a town hall Youll need a blacksmith and lumber mill to upgrade your troopsswordsmanarcherscatapults ect and from that point you can add specialty forces such as gnomes mages and flying birds that crap explosive eggs Note that im referring to the human race because i play that all the time The orcs are very different and frankly quite weird One of their units for example is a huge beast with two heads that only uses its fists as a weapon Both races can make a cool spy plane and a fairly complete navy as well as towers that can be upgraded to shoot cannons or arrows Oil is another resource thats needed to make some more advanced units  A lot of strategy is required because maps are very crowded with many narrow passage ways Some maps even start you off completely surrounded by trees so you cant go anywhere untill you cut down a path I like those maps because it prevents quick attacks
Game play is fairly easy to learn You just click on a building and the unit you want to build Its easy to order your units to fight or where to go but you can only control  units at a time The biggest negative about this game is that you cant queue up your barricks to produce more than one unit at a time This can make the game a bit too busy and tiring and requires you to have several barricks For example to maintain a steady source of resources you may need two main camps and one smaller one surrounding gold mines That means probably at least  barricks three town halls as well as at least one gnomish inventor and aviary and a navy or two Considering you will have at least a couple dozen peons gathering resources and building farms it becomes a contest of who can point and click the fastest as you constantly move from building to building while trying to control your military units A lot of work Too bad blizzard hasnt added the multi queing feature which exists in age of empires gold and just about any newer game Maybe there is a mod that can be downloaded to ad this feature but it is not available here For that reason i only give the game  but it still makes for plenty of good clean fun for very little money
socksBrought this game for myself it brought back memories when I was  playing this all summer long Game came as described and fast alsoFive yrs ago the toughest SNK superstars faced off in tagteam action in the excellent arcade game KOF  Now the series is back but it hasnt learned anything new The KOFDMman thats a long titlechugs away with  tired fighting mechanics and subpar graphics King features characters from Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting The fights are fun but you still cant change characters during a match Technically Kings loaded with deficencies most notably choppy slowdownfilled D sprite graphics For a part of an essentially  bit game to a  bit system these flaws are inexcuseable and baffling Its nice that the DC isnt limiting itself to polygononly D fighting titles But compared to Marvel vs Capcom Dream is a nightmareIve been playing the Comanche game series since version  in the DOS days  I know these games better than anyone whos written any of these reviews  Comanche Gold is nothing more than Comanche  only upgraded to a Windows version and with new missions added  The engine is the same settings are the same graphics are the same but with increased resolution sound is the same and wingman and enemy AI is the same though they claimed it was vastly improved  Now many years old this game is still fantastic and one of the best helo sims you can get for multiple reasons

Flight Model  The flight model is as complex or accurate as you want it  or as dumbed down and Nintendo as you want it  Many settings are at your disposal  If you have full HOTAS and rudder pedals you can change the many control settings to be very accurate  Top notch compared to others  I can also run this game on a MHz Pentium I pulled out of mothballs or on the latest greatest Ps with gigabytes of RAM and the helo flies the same without speeding up or becoming unrealistic  Thats how well the engine and flight model were written  I will even dare say that the flight model feels better and more solid than the otherwise vastly superior Comanche 

AI  The AI for enemies and wingmen in Comanche  for DOS was not very realistic but very adequate for the game  Nova Logic claims to have vastly improved on it for Comanche Gold  I will state that it is much better now but still not perfect  I will simply call it adequate and average  To this day however I still have yet to see ANY game  whatsoever  with a truly realistic enemy AI  Theyre getting closer but still have a long way to go

Compatibility  This version of Comanche can be played on ANY bit Windows box ever built and on any version of Windows from  to bit XP  Its beautiful in its simplicity in that it doesnt require any special hardware  It even runs great on old laptops  

Graphics  Fantastic for not being D accellerated  Nova Logic got lots of mileage out of its Voxel Space graphics engine  It was pure frickin magic in its day  Comanche  had only X resolution  This versin however allows you to use X or kick it up to X which noticeably improves the graphics quality and resolution in the game

Sound  Comanche  for DOS was  Dolby Surround  not bad for a DOS game from   Comanche Golds sound however is limited only by what kind of sound system you have connected to your PC  Comanche Gold also boasts the most realistic ingame dialog sequences youre gonna hear  Ingame dialog is an area where nearly every game Ive ever heard fails miserably with the cheesiest sounding scripts ever written that are read in the dumbest most unrealistic way possible  Thats the NORM in the gaming world  The Comanche series however  as well as every other Nova Logic game  gets it right

EnvironmentLandscape  Nova Logic did something with the Comanche series that nobody else ever did and still have yet to do with a helo sim  TREES  Longbow Enemy Engaged etc  Yawn snore  I couldnt believe Longbow II was so terribly done  Without trees and cool landscape items to hide behind a helo sim is utterly worthless and completely deafeats the very purpose of being in a helo in the first place  Once again Noval Logic gets it right  Trees nooks crannies gullies etc  The best landscape a rotor jockey could ever hope for is found in Comanche Gold  What good is sneaking around and flying napoftheearth if youre still out in the open with no trees and gullies to zigzag throgh  You are even able to hide behind and between not only trees but BOULDERS in this game  Comanche Gold is untouched by any other rival in this category  with the possible exception of Comanche 

Fun factor  One thing Nova Logic has been able to do that nearly no other game manufacturer has ever been able to do on a consistent basis is FUN FACTOR  They have always provided a wellbalanced game in terms of simulation complexity vs fun factor  You do not want a sim so realistic that you spend all your time getting shot down because youre fighting controls that are way too complex  You also dont want to feel like youre playing a little kiddie game that has no realism at all  Comanche series has always been the perfect balance of realism complexity and fun factor  You get to fly a realistic chopper and blow a whole bunch of stuff apart and with as much or as little complexity as you want  There are reviews in here that say the game is both too hard and too easy  I rest my case

Multiplayer  I have played this game in multiplayer mode more times than anyone else I know  It is fantastic  It is here that the fun factor truly comes to light  I know the game has passed into history to the extent that you wont find huge numbers playing it online anymore  Maybe theres folks playing it on Kali still it truly deserves to be  One thing Ill say is this multiplayer functionality was always fantastic and worked very well  We never had any problems with it

Out of the many years that Comanche  and Gold have given me in faithful service and countless hours of fun the least I could do is write up an article that would somehow convey my gratitude for this game  Comanche Gold and Comanche  are the two helo sims that I live for to this day

Please read both of my reviews of Comanche  as well written under both this name here and also Highwinder the name I used for the most recent review both of which are here on Amazon  Just search for Comanche 

 stars for fun factor  stars for adequate but dated technology and wingmanenemy AI that though improved and adequate could have been improved even moreever since I bought USAF I was like great but I need a Sim for a chopper  Comanche Gold suited my needs this sim has good graphics runs on most PCs and has over  missions  You can contol everything from altitude  hold to extending and retracting the Cargo bay doors
Let me tell you  about this chopper it has the latest stealth techonolegy the Radar sig  is X smaller than the AH Apache  If you hover at ft no one will  see you  This isnt bad for   When I bought this I was wondering what  was the catch Truth is no catchThe original Tomb Raider was a landmark game for the Playstation and the start of a very long running series It holds up well but is a definite acquired taste

Tomb Raider begins with adventurer and treasure huntress Lara Croft being hired by business woman Jacqueline Natla to search an ancient cavern in Peru for a piece of the Scion an ancient talisman of great power However after finding the piece Lara is betrayed by Jacquelines men Now its a race across the world to find the remaining pieces of the Scion before Jacqueline attains its mythical power Tomb Raider is an early Playstation game and unfortunately the graphics havent aged very well Although many set pieces in the game are very impressive all the levels tend to feel very samey Despite this the games length is impressive There are over fifteen massive levels with hidden caches of ammo and first aid packs giving you a great sense of exploration throughout the game Lara moves in a very stiff fashion Her controls are tanklike and You have to hold down a button for her to walk She takes very long jumps but running jumps have a delay that requires you to plan your jumps ahead of time in most cases Fortunately there is a training mission where Lara instructs you on how to play in her home The game is primarily a puzzle platformer Each level contains a series of puzzles that will test your problem solving skills

Scattered throughout the many ruins and caves are vicious animals and hired goons all chomping at the bit to impede your progress This is where combat comes into play Lara starts off the game with twin pistols that have unlimited ammo Through out the game you will find a variety of firearms however these weapons do have limited ammo but the pistols ensure you will always have a fighting chance in battle
The last gameplay feature to talk about is the process of saving your game The PC version of the game allowed the player to quicksave wherever they wanted The console versions of the game on Playstation and Sega Saturn do not have this luxury You can only save with the use of crystals that are placed along the path you are intended to follow Unfortunately once a crystal is used it is gone This makes it really difficult when youve got a very long stretch ahead of you and not much health Some areas have multiple crystals forcing you to carefully plan how often you save

This game has many flaws but it is a very rewarding experience I would recommend the game for those expecting a challenge The later games in the Tomb Raider series ironed out many of the issues experienced here If youre curious about the beginning of the franchise you wont be disappointed but maybe a little stressed

For classic PC gamers Id recommend Tomb Raider Unfinished Business This is the original game plus two bonus missions with two new levels a pieceI love the delta force games I just wish they didnt let people cheat Go buy the newest oneI bought one of these back when the N was still a modern console and I just bought another one on Amazon Obviously I think this product is pretty adequate since I bought two of them But heres some additional detail

Pros The bundle comes with both a rumble pak and a controller pak or memory card How cool is that If youre buying stuff off of Amazon it saves you about four dollars in shipping fees Whats better is how cheap the Tremor Pak Plus is now If you snoop around you can get this bundle new for the price youd pay for a either individual product by itself

As for the actual rumbling it works pretty awesomely Ive tried it out on Perfect Dark and Madden  so far Its got high and low settings True N players use high for maximum vibration 

The memory card is the same size as the controller pak Nintendo originally made Alas it is not bundled with some of the larger memory cards that InterAct produced But most games will easily fit onto the page card

Cons The Tremor Pak Plus is both larger and heavier than the Rumble Pak produced by Nintendo not to mention the original Tremor Pak produced by InterAct This is because it has an additional slot to stick a memory card into the Tremor Pak Presumably InterAct thought people would like it since it allowed them to use a controller pak and a rumble pak at the same time Nice thought on their part but the original Tremor Pak is as a consequence much sleeker and even more desirable than this improved version

In summation I sort of wish Interact had just given us a bundle with the original Tremor Pak and a page memory card as opposed to this bulky contraption with a slot Even so Id totally recommend this bundle to anyone whose interested in the gracefully aged console that is the NI order this a few days ago and it came no longer than three The memory card is what I mainly wanted and the rumble pak Ill just let anyone who plays as the fourth player can use it because I had three rumble paks for my other controllers before this order but no memory card yet When I order this it said like new and guess what It actually came brand new sealed in the hard plastic that normally takes scissors to cut I like this seller because they mean what they say I also ordered this in the used section which is also weird I still got it new but im sure you know that Like most people said the rumble pak is kinda more heavier but im not even going to use it anyway because again I already have a rumble pak for my other controllers The only thing I really hate about the rumble is that all rumble paks I own take triple AAA batteries The problem with that is batteries run out I do have some advice for some people purchasing this If you want a rumble pak try to find rechargable triple AAA batteries if you can By the way the memory card can also be used alone without the rumble pak It should of been powered in the controller though I guess thats old school for youThis game is pretty cool
The mini games are funI love emThe questions are a littleeeeyy lets skip that oneThe game is overall very funI was addicted to this game at some pointMe n friends would have a blast playing this gameAnyone who loves South park will enjoy this game
Though I doulbt You can get this game since its out of print  I guess you can get it used if you can find it
Over all its pretty fun but its alittle inapropraite for little ones
I liked it though
LaterThose out there who decide to play a game based solely on the hype it creates no doubt know how cool The Final Fantasies and The Lunar series are  But if you skipped over this one just because it did not create the Final fantasy type of hype prior to its release you missed something special
When I picked up Suikoden it was a slow night and just about everything else I wanted to rent was out  When I first played it I was slightly ambivolent in my decision as to whether or not It was a cool game  The opening intro with its soulful choir gripping and excellently composed music and great still pics of the games scenes and cast blows away almost every tune in the final fantasy audio library  Heck Andrew Loyed Webber or John Williams would be hard pressed to do better  But upon entering the game things seemed to be only average  Though the story was good and the dialouge was well written and there were powerful and very funny scenes early on it lacked Final fantasys epic atmosphere  Also the opening is the games audio highlight  Dont expect it to get any better then that  But what Suikoden II lacks in atmosphere it makes up for in substance  The charachters are written in such a way that even the most fantastic and unreal scenarios seem believable  From Luca Blights savagery and cruelty to Shus strategic brilliance to Jowrys desparate measures that he takes to protect those he loves every moment is very believable and real
Also helping the game is the number of secrets and sidequests that there are  Its here that Suikoden shines there are limitless quests charachters minigames and hidden items for you to find and do  Giving the Game Unrivaled depth
This game is a heavy hitter  Theres no doubt about that but I liked the final fantasies better  They just have a way of grabbing you by the heart strings that Suikoden Rarely achives  Its still one of the most awesome Rpgs out there and I do reccommend it to anyone whos already completed Chrono Cross or Final fantasy IX  With a little more tweaking Suikoden III will be able to hang with those big RPG bad boyzThis game fetches for hundreds of dollars nowadays but with that said this is a pretty good game You have a plot that interconnects with  different characters that can be recruited at their perspective times but unless you are a completionist you will be extremely disappointed in the ending you will get Now whether or not you want to spend  on this is entirely up to you I spent it and I felt I somewhat got my moneys worth but at the same time a little disappointed that I spent this much on a game but oh well there is worse like  for Panzer Dragoon Saga Anyways just like with any other Suikoden entry you can go to war with the kingdom whom the main character is opposing with and use all kinds of tactics in battle that will determine your fate The story is pretty solid and the character development is also quite solid as well and you have a lot of lush beautiful environments to traverse through with a world map Overall this game is good but be prepared to drop a fraction of your wallet if you want thisThis was not a cheap game but its rare so I was expecting that I wish it had the case but Im sure that was part of the reason it was so cheap Either way the game is in great conditionFans of the series will tell you its worth the money its going for but I think if you missed Suikoden II you missed it  Suikoden  is better afterall  Even the reviewers will tell you  Im not saying this is a bad game it was actualy a very good one but its not worth shelling out  dollars forIt does what it says it will Doesnt come unplugged unexpectedly or anythingWorks just fine  So far I havent had any issues with the product  Most likely Ill be buying two more to complete my setQuite the little breakthrough when this game came out although on the surface one would not really know whyYes the graphics are especially nice for the time the tone is decidedly dark and the plot is  unusual but what players became facinated by was the development of the story and how it related to your gameplayMore game makers should take the cues that psychology plays in this game as it offers an entirely new less restrictive playground for the seasoned player to venture off intoSanitarium opens with a movie  a man on his way home from work calls his wife with the news that he has the answer  Next thing you know his car flies off the road He wakes up in an institution his face swathed in bandages with no idea who he is where he is or how he got there  Of course this is exactly what he  and you as the player  must now find out
Sanitarium is a really great oldstyle rd person adventure game that combines an intriguing story with interesting puzzles a spooky atmosphere and pretty decent graphics for its time In its nine levels you visit various parts of the asylum a huge insect hive a scary circus and other places all steeped in the main characters personal mythology  Each level not only has its own internal continuity but is connected to the larger story by threads of symbol and dream logic  I found this fascinating and extremely well done  It was one of the things that kept me wanting to play even when it was late at night and my eyes couldnt focus any moresomething I havent experienced with a game in a while
The puzzles are a pretty good variety  some inventory some conversation some mechanical  Most are pretty easy once you find what youre looking for but there are a couple of frustrating pixel hunts where its possible to miss the one thing you need to move on  Also sometimes the inventory which flashes when it can be used has to be positioned in exactly the right place  There are also a few action sequences and you can die  Usually I really object to this in adventure games but Sanitarium handles the action the way it should be handled  the sequences are pretty straightforward if you die you get to start again at the beginning of the sequence without going through a tedious You failed ending sequence or reloading from page one you have infinite lives and the pieces of the puzzle you have managed to solve STAY solved so you dont have to repeat what youve already done over and over  Take a tip from this game designers
Navigation is a little awkward to start  you interact using the left mouse button and move using the right  but you get used to that quickly enough The main problem is that the character can get sucked into things like stairs so you spend a lot of time going back and forth or I did anyway  Another problem is that sometimes you have to have your character in exactly the right spot before hell do what hes supposed to  If hes not close enough hell say I cant do that or some variation thereof  Except for sometimes when hell walk over and complete the action on his own  I found no rhyme or reason to this and it got a bit annoying in places
The graphics are midnineties graphics  rd person D  So if you cant appreciate a game that doesnt have all the latest bells and whistles you wont appreciate this one There are some really gruesome scenes not for the faint of heart or stomach The voice acting is mostly pretty good but in some places character voices were hard to understand  There are subtitles though so that wasnt a problem  Other sound fx were welldone being suited to the various environments yet not too repetetive or demanding of attention
I completed Sanitarium in about  hours  If I had a complaint it was that the ending was a little rushed and I felt that all the gaps in the story hadnt been filled in  Still compared to the bulk of games that are being released today this is a great find and a worthwhile buy  If you like older adventures Sanitarium is a mustThis game brought back a lot of fun memories that I had as a kid The only thing I can say is that you will have a hard time playing this if you do not have a playstation controller with an analog stick The controls are EXTREMELY difficult Im not sure if im just used to the modern age stuff or if the controls are supposed to be like that Anyway good luckI was feeling nostalgic so I bought this game along with a few others to relive my childhood Its as much fun as I remember A bit repetitive as there are only a few levels and most are quick but its definitely entertaining the whole time Totally worth the buyI ordered this game a few months ago and my son beat this game in one hour  This is not the game for you if you are over the age of   The game would just be too easy If you have a son or daughter under  years they might like it

The game is about when Tommy loses his puzzle pieces so with the help of his friends he has to go get them back  This game has  missions that ranges from getting a cereal box in a store to getting your grandpas teeth from a goose  They are really funny especially in Grandpas Teeth when Chuckies yells Hellllllllllllllllp in a Texan accent

These games graphics are good for its time

The sound is very great and very bad at the same time

Overall this game is real good and I recommend it to anyone who has little kids who like RugratsThis game is awesome I remember getting this game and being extremely excited because it was Rugrats This really IS a great Rugrats game the best that has came out In this game you can play golf and even walk around Tommys entire house and backyard This is a great game that is a lot like the show Rugrats in Paris The Movie for teh N has got nothing on this game Buy this for anyone that is a fan of the show

WWE WM  is a great game with tons of matches
When I first got this It was around the time it first came out
Man this game is awesome  They steel cage match Hardcore match and I cant remember but I think they had first bloodI thinkI dont remember
The graphics were good for its time  Gameplay was quick which is a good thing  It is also the first N game to have blood in a WWE game
My favorite match is the steel cage  Its sooo fun but I wish they had a Hell in The Cell match

LaterYour trying to stop alien clones from taking over the world yattta  yatta
There are  modes  AdventureExplore where you go through the complex looking for the ones responsible  And the other is battle mode
Battle mode is where it gets all my stars  I love the selection of moves you learn  The indepth way to accuratly take out your foe is impressive  Every type of kick and punch also up to or was it  combos  Holding movesfront and back  Reversals and lying down moves
This is a fight feast galore  With rping stats  Many attributes to level uparmlegsetc  In fact every move you use will level up and be stronger
Good game good story nice sound effects  People that bad mouth this game either didnt give it enough time Or just cant handle something orginal  Or maybe the people that like this game are of a mold of a different gamer
Bottomline There is no game out there with more moves then this
And with that If you like fighting games and dont mind the rp syle battle mode then its difintely deserves to be in your game libary I dont find the battle mode constricting or reduce the fun in anywayGot it for my sons Sega works great does what its supposed to do fits perfectly into the TV and the SegaFrom the ruins of Rome to the futuristic setting of Atlantis Tomb Raider takes the gamer through a variety of wonderful worlds  Unlike its sequels it stays in the tombs and out of other settings  I believe that it is one of the best games ever made and it certainly is a classic  However I believe that its sequels in many aspects overshadow it
The scenery in Tomb Raider is better than most games although it is mostly cubed and flat  The game play and plot are wonderful and the graphics and sounds are acceptable  However the artificial intelligence enemies are less than intelligent and the gamer is often left feeling underestimated with the ease of some of the puzzles  Lauras moves are limited and the weapons supply is less than perfect
I would recommend this game to any fan of the Tomb Raider series and to the average gamer  However I do feel that other versions have better qualities  Tomb Raider II offers wonderful AI and is perhaps the best for a gamer seeking combat Tomb Raider III combines the better aspects of the previous two and Tomb Raider The Last Revelation offers the best plot and character mobility  If you are looking to stay in the tombs or if you are not into puzzles stick with this game  However dont miss out on the other great qualities the Tomb Raider series offersWhy is everyone upset with this game Im not sure but Im not one of them I guess everyone expected alot more than the original Total Annihilation and what they got was something designed a little better Maybe a little too pretty Here is what the game has going for it Excellent detail to the each unit building and the surrounding terrain A good story Units with special attack features and some of these are really cool The gameplay is pretty good also The online gaming at boneyards This is where the game really excels and is probably more competitive What couldve been better The soundtrack wasnt very good There was too much quietness when playing And in some of the battles the only way in was a narrow passage where only  units could stand side by side the computer would just pack this passage way and it would take forever to get in it took me over  hours on  such battles towards the end of the game I would probably rate this closer to   stars but I did enjoy this game Lots of different characters and some pretty good battlesThis was a curiosity purchase that sat for awhile  I finally fired it up on an XP machine  Do get the upgrade if you can find it

There are  scenerios in the self play  The AI is ok  If you are a defensive player you will like this game

The scenerios range from what feels like a demo of new features  For example when the cannons first appear you get one scenerio defending a pass  I didnt ahve to do anything as the cannon fire wiped out that attackers that kept charging into the guns

The hardest scenero for me was vengence  You are warned to set up before detecting and it is true  I got noticed and was swarmed  I built of up defenses in order to build the army  Unfortunatly the AI dug in rather well and it took a constant barrage of air armadas of dragons and fairies to defeat the well placed towers  Each tower was coverd by the others

The GUI can get annoying as if you dont pay attention and click you will send units or builders in a direction you didnt intend

The gold dragon was a fun introduction  Though I will admit it made the fighting easier

The story line is good  However you will switch between sides during the play  It gets a little strange at times as you invade and set up a base  Then the next scenerio you play the otherside and are supposed to destroy the base

Overall its not a bad game  Especially at current prices

I am going ot look for the addonI see alot of people on here griping and nitpicking about what this game has and doesnt have  Is it something groundbreaking Nah  Is it something that hasnt been done before Nah Is it still a pretty darn nifty game  you betcha  Its a RTS period and all RTS games seem to suffer universally from similar ailments  These being certain tactics units et al that are very powerful yada yada just play it  I happen to think the graphics are pretty darn nice myself and the elevation changes are quite good as well FOUR sides to choose from gives a nice variety of units and such  Not alot to be said some things could have been done better but its a cool game  I think however that the super units could be all together bypassed if Cavedog and other Designers Blizzard for instance would adopt the Tech Level variable a la Command  Conquer for multiplay games  Sometime I wana just batten down and have an allout slug fest with the basic grunt units in the game All the upperlevel stuff is cool but it really does detract from the fun of the games because theres no strategy involved in dropping a NukeMagic Death SpellWhatever on your opponent Anyhow I ramble hehehe did I mention this is a good game and you should buy itEven as a  year old man this game can still creep the crap out of me  Happy as all heck to have it againclassic total classic had to see where the series began and i gotta say its one of the best titles in the series thus far next to I have played all of the main Silent Hill games but I didnt own this game until a few years ago Recently I decided to finish it and see how it really held up At first I wasnt so sure how well it held up but the more I played the better it got

A big difference with this game in comparison to the later ones is that the psychological aspects are less welldefined As a result it feels less cohesive than the later games Thats not to say that it doesnt have sad or scary moments though It definitely has those more the latter than the former but is held back by the dated technology and bad voice acting I actually still like the graphics because the distinctly rusted and bloody design of the parallel world shines through and there are some fine textures and special lighting effects The more realistic prerendered cutscenes still hold up well A unique aspect of these scenes is that they have no dialog whatsoever which was an artistic challenge that paid off in conveying the characters emotions better than the unearthly voice acting could

The voice acting is not very good Some of the actors seem miscast and suffer from uneven performances It doesnt detract too much from the experience but can trigger eye rolls in more cynical audiences

The music is less distinct than later games and favors some very odd disturbing tracks such as My Heaven go ahead look it up on YouTube D that are less melodic and more industrial On the other hand from the weapons to the monsters to the environmental noise the sound effects fit the game very well They serve to make Silent Hill seem more alive

As for the gameplay its decent if not as tight as the Resident Evil games of the time I enjoyed fighting more than the puzzles which I always found a bit too hard and obscure just wait until you hit the infamous Zodiacthemed puzzle If the puzzles annoy you just hit up GameFAQs for the solutions Its worth it to get past them

The controls were a little confusing since Im more used to later survival horror games and I sometimes found myself awkwardly readying my weapon when I wanted to strafe The game is a little tight with healing supplies but not ammo I wish I had used my firearms more

I found that this game was scary but not as much as the later games were and in a different way It relies more on jump scares and doesnt instill quite as much consistent dread I was pleasantly surprised to still find some of the monsters scary and shocking which I cant say for later games on the other hand

The story was always hard to understand and depending on what ending you unlock will be even harder to comprehend It lacks thematic cohesion and I always found it to be one of the lesser Silent Hill tales Luckily the game has a lot of replay value and was made with multiple playthroughs in mind

Ultimately Silent Hill holds up but not as well as Silent Hill  Its still a classic in its genre with a great setting and levels but if you cant get past the dated presentation you can knock a star off of this review

Mine was a used copy that arrived complete and in a condition that is comparable to a new copyFighting Force was the wannabe Streets Of Rage for PlayStation If you grew up in the s and owned a Sega youll know what Im talking about The game had tons of flaws such as the lofidelity sound effects sssshhhhheeeewwwmmm and the blocky PClike design of the characters Heck it looked like a Windows  platform game

There are four characters to choose from  two chicks a big giant and the handsome one They each have their own moves but have serious shortcomings Smasher can take a lot of damage and deal it too but hes slow as a mule Hawk is a decent fighter but is open to a lot of hits Alana and Mace are both quick alana moreso but are weak and fragile

The game was unduly hard due to the overhaul of the games engine Back then games overloaded easily especially if they were not rendered correctly The load times on this game tell you theres a lot of extra space here An obvious pitfall is when there are many enemiesitems on the screen it evokes slow command response but ONLY from players controllers remember trying to grab a guy and your player executes an air grab  second after you press the button This resulted in getting beat up from  or more directions and having a briefcase hurled at your head Not fun Items were also a bother as you found that punching a guy mysteriously involved you picking up a crate first Then you got kicked in the shin and you dropped the crate as two more guys fired shots at you and youre spinning through the air Fun Yet when you want to pull a pole off the wall you instead invoke a reverse backhand that misses and makes you look like an idiot And for that ugly move sir you get a pipe to the face

You eventually either get frustrated with the game or you learn to live with it The game experience for me is always bitter sweet because even though Ive learned to live with the quirks they still get in my way The game gets progressively harder as you advance through the levels and sometimes you white knuckle your controller to keep from using a continue which by the way starts you over on the leveltotally bogus When you finally DO finish the game it seems underwhelming Youll see what I mean when you finish it

All in all despite its obvious and frustrating flaws the game is still a classic If you dont own it you owe it to yourself to take a trip back in time Relive the polygonal loadingscreen glorybeing the survivla horror fan I am I have to start by saying that if you happen to see this at a discount store or bargen bin pick it up and hold it close as the game has become very rare in many areas of the world This was Konamis answer to Capcoms Resident Evil and still is one of the most popular horror games today The game unlike REsident Evil or many other horror games chooses to scare you in a more mental quiet sense not to say resident evil is bad Im mearly saying SH and RE are very different form one another The game is not for the faint of heart or those with out a healthy ammount of patience as the game focuses mainly on puzzle soving and exploration although the graphics are dated by todays standards this is easilly overlooked once you start playing Although the game offers a fantasic story and haunting atmosphere I highly recomend Silent Hill  over the orrigional as it has better controlls smoother visuals and an even better story I have played many horror games and believe me when I say that this one and its sequels stand out amongst the rest and shoud be added to any games collection Silent hill is not a game to missBefore SIlent Hill was released all we horror gamers had to scare us were the Resident Evil Biohazard series of games with big flashy chills and spills and the Alone In The Dark series which were just plain bad console conversions of average PC games It just goes to show what can be done with a genre when a development team sits down and outs their heads together properly
Eclipsing Resident Evil and all other competitors in terms of scares character development and sophistication Silent Hill upon its release in  was unfairly ignored by the general public even though critics were highly impressed with its blend of psychological methodscares and realtime environments The public used to zombie dogs bursting through windows and supersharp prerendered backdrops couldnt seem to get into a foggy realtime atmosphere where what you heard was scarier than what you saw However thanks in no small part to its sequels the standardsetting Silent Hill  and the graphically amazing slightly hollow SIlent Hill  the original Silent Hill now enjoys something of a Classic status and I have to say its very welldeserved
You play Harry Mason a widower whose daughter Cheryl goes missing en route to their vacation in the resort town of Silent Hill Along the way you encounter allies and enemies Cybil the Cop Dr Michael Nurse Lisa and the memorable Dahlia Gillespie one of the series coolest characters to date and unravel the ghastly truth behind the desertion and possession of a seemingly innocent town
The graphics havent aged well but still have the ability to scare One of the first survival horrorgames to utilise fully modelled realtime environments the camera angles and darknessfog make for some truly chilling views You find your way with the aid of a map torch and a radio that emits static only when an enemy is close Since darkness and fog are very cleverly employed in the game ostensibly to keep the slowdown to a minimum it also serves to heighten the tense atmosphere what you hear and do not see is a lot scarier than what you do see There are also several of the truly cool nightmarish vignettes that the series has become famous for  PyramidHeads in steel cages the Mark of Samael and terribly wasted corpses cling to walls and ceilings and give us a deeper sense of the ravages of satanism
The gameplay and controls in the game while doing nothing really new for the genre are loose and easy This is a system that will never be perfect lacking the fluidity of the Tomb Raider games and the precision of pointandclick adventures but does the job nicely The autoaim of games like Residnet Evil isnt present so shooting can become a tense and exciting exercise  but youll more often than not end up running scared from whatever it is you cant see
The characterisation is superior thanks in no small part to superb prerendered cut scenes and excellent voice acting Konami have taken great pains in all of their Silent Hill games to make sure that we understand the characters in the game and the original is no exception Our protagonist Harry is the dullest of the players but hes still a likeable and wellrealised character Cheryl is not the stereotypical bugeyed Manga cute girl weve come to expect from Japanese games and shes all the more realistic and endearing because of it Nurse Lisa is sinister and forbidding in her surroundings but her innocence and frailty is heartrending  I defy anyone not to mist up when she makes her exit in the game And Dahlia Gillespie is a masterpiece shes a scary eccentric old woman that will stay in the memory long after youve finished playing
I hate giving away plot points in my reviews and I wont here either but a word of advice from a survivalhorror completist  CONSERVE YOUR AMMO Depending on the ending you get one of a possible five you may have to fight up to three endofgame bosses And nothing spoils your enjoyment of a game more than having to replay the final half for more ammo
All in all Silent Hill is a convoluted enthralling game It may be slightly roughlooking in places but its wellworth the ride and an absolute MUST if you intend to play the laterst installment Highly recommendedZombie BabiesZombie Babies its what makes the game tick The controls were sloppy but i really didnt mind cause the graphics were awsome One of my favorites i really enjoyedI played this game right after I finished Metal Gear Solid and while I was a little let down from the switch I found the game entertaining  I played it at like  in the morning with the lights out and it can kinda freak you out  It is an old game now but if you liked the Resident Evil series and never got to try this one pick it up for your PS or PS  Also if you are thinking about getting SH definately play this game cause it helps you understand the townTheres pus spewing from the kitchen sink the walls are bleeding the fog is so thinck you can cut it with a knife and this is during the daylight hours Things get worse at night as a demon world attempts to merge itself with our own This is the premise of the story as Harry Mason navigates his way through this errily bizzare town that his hauntingly a lot like something only the most twisted and bizar mind could create Resident Evil has its shock moments but regardless of what anyone might tell you for a real scare the original Silent Hill is the game to play This is hands down the creepiest game and while it has few of the zombie jumping through the window sort of scares there is a great deal of darkness and erie sounds to compensate This is a different kind of horror than RE a game that bares no resemblance to this original master piece with the exception of the irritating control style but thats where the similarities end RE relies on catching you off guard SH requires you to constantly be on guard and plays on your paranoia the entire time especially with the radio While RE comes off as a fun Bmovie SH comes off as the darkest dream you dont want to remember which makes it a worthwhile experience well worth the money
It also features some of the finest FMV sequences to grace the PS topping the work of Final Fantasy VIII The in game graphics leave a lot to be desired though This is another game I would like to see remade for GCN however Konami has taken a very stubborn antiGCN stance the likelyhood that this will happen is slim
 As with most Survival Horror titles this game packs an awkward control style that is even more devistating to the overal game than the RE control because the camera moves as though it were stalking you a cool effect that is hindered by the horrible control set up a problem that was adjusted in the PSXbox sequel Restless Dreams Aside from this complaint the game is brilliant and every horror fan should pick this title up However this game is NOT for kids nor is it for the weak in stomach and faint of heart It takes a strongh stomach and even stronger will power to get through this game I dont care how strong you think you are this game will scare youUnfortunately the singleplayer is incredibly boringjust bots and skirmishes  If there was a campaign this game is flawless
The multiplayer is great and there are plenty of great modifications for this game  But if you dont have a broadband internet connection dont think about it  This game revolves on a good internet connectioni would recommend getting this game for many reasons you have  characters to choose from you can pick the route you want the levels are well designed along with the chaacters  the fighting style are also great you get to pick up weapons  use tit against them the playstation version is the best one to buySilent Hill is one of the best survival horror games out there even better so than Resident Evil As earlier reviews have pointed out this game is not for the faint of heart The story concerns Harry an average man who comes to the small town of Silent Hill a town with a scarred history He is on vacation with his daughter Cheryl and on their way there is an accident When Harry comes to he finds himself alone his daughter missing Add to this the town is deserted As you might expect there are dangerous monsters lurking about The purpose of this game is to find Harrys daughter and unlock the secrets of Silent Hills past It wont be easy though
Silent Hill is better than RE in that it provides much more realism Harry is an average person like you or me not a hero or arsenal on two legs Like most humans he is not an expert at conflict so this makes the battles much tougher The atmosphere is where this game reallt excells The deserted town is creepier than anything out of a horror movie with fog so thick that you cannot see  feet in front of you The snow falls steadily The music is subtle adding to the creepiness The monsters come out of nowhere and there are many occasions that will make you jump
There is less action than the other survival horror games but in a game like this it is not a big loss The game is more about solving puzzles than blowing monsters into oblivion Unlike RPGs there are no  experiece points no levils no benefit to fighting every single creature Running from fights is often the best move
The one big flaw which prevents this game from getting five stars is the clunky controls I pity the person who plays this game without the analog joysticks Harry is very difficult to move around thanks to the complicated control system It takes a while to get used to them but by that time you will have gotten killed a few times The monsters come out of nowhere and you have mere seconds to react With controls this complicated battles are really frustrating
But all in all this is a fantastic game Lots of depth thrills and scares Sadly this title is out of print so grab it if you can find it But it comes with a warning it is violent and disturbing Use with cautionAs you could guess being a film student and all that I prefer slightly the cinematic fear of the BiohazardResident Evil series over this much more eerie style of fear but that doesnt mean that this game didnt scare me as much if not more
Whats so great about Silent Hill is that the danger has a sense of reality to it unlike in Resident Evil where you really just fight some monsters who jump through windows at you and watch some highly entertaining scenes The fog adds a new element of fear in which something might be out there and with the radio you KNOW when there is an unseen terror lurking in the shadows or precipitation Real life is more like that where you cant see your enemies not where they are just big enough to withstand several direct shotgun shots
However enough comparisons to the horrorking series because this game is neither better nor worse This game is simply different Your hero isnt a cop and the disaster is much more philosophical and fantastic than scientific which isnt just Resident Evil but also Parasite Eve This isnt as much XFiles as it is the Twighlight Zone
The story is about Harry Mason an average Joe coming to the resort town Silent Hill with his daughter What he doesnt realize is that at that very time the forces of darkness are struggling almost fighting one another As a result there are many dead people around and the town itself is now pulsating with evil Sometimes hell leave a building where the time of day or the design of the town will change within seconds right before his eyes However after each boss battle all the superlevels of darkness will subside and the daytime will come about again where the danger is much more scarce its kindof like Castlevania II Simons Quest a true classic where there are times of light evil and times of overwhelming evil However unlike Simons Quest you cannot just wait it out
The main point that Im trying to make is that this game is easily as scary as Resident Evil but its less in the real world yet it has a strange sense of familiarity to it However if you were brought up with the other survival horror world than dont expect this to just me one of the better entries this is its own unique bloodline well Fear Effect was similar but THIS is MUCH MUCH BETTER I know horror players who have given up on this game due to the fact that it is too scary I have myself and Im sure all these other reviewers did as well You will too but that doesnt mean that you wont like itOverall this game is the creepiest videog ame I have ever played  The environments enimies and gameplay are designed to keep the player interested and a little on the edge  THe only true problem with this title is that it offers nothing new and relies very much on the style of playing created by Resident Evil  Not that this style is bad but within Silent Hill the gameplay just didnt feel quite as great as it did with Resident Evil and at times I got a little bored with the wandering around the level that must be done from time to time  Despite these few complaints this is an excellant title that fans of the survival horror genre should enjoyWhile the online debate rages as to Q versus UT I would argue that there  is room for both
That being said if you only had cash to purchase one  of the two heavyweights I would probably recommend this first  Out of the  box it offers a more complete gaming experience over the competition with  more styles of gameplay and better bot support
The Ups Lots of  different things to do with this game  Fun maps  If I had to pick one  word for UT it would be FUN  It has a feel that is very unique but is  quite enjoyable  The bots are pretty amazing as well
The Downs Not  quite as pretty to look at even with a superdeeduper video card as I  expected
Overall A simply amazing game considering how much they put  into one little box  Lots of fun on line or off  One of my top regularsI hate first person shooters  I really do
Except this one
Why  Well Unreal Tournament is hardly the traditional first person shooter of  blast everything to pieces and maybe youll survive  Sure it  starts like that just like every other shooter ought to in order to  familiarize you with the control system and interface but immediately  thereafter you begin to see that with game modes like Capture the Flag  Domination and Assault things are entirely different
Strategy becomes  an enormous factor in playing this game purely because your objectives  will often require teamwork  The game has made this easy by providing you  with the ability to individually change each of your robotic teammates AI  Better yet play with your friends via the internet NOTE internet play  is extremely laggy so i wouldnt recommend even trying it without a  broadband connection of some kind
The graphics are decidedly sharp for  a lowpolygon count game and the lighting and textures are superb  Animation and other movement is actually somewhat realistic and its nice  to see that things are finally changing in the world of FPSThis game is truly a great game and a classic This game gives endless entertainment and great graphics Although its very addictingit never wears out Offering many fun and awesome worlds and many heavy and huge  weapons This game does not have extreme gore you can change the settings  and it is not that bad in the first place This is a masterpiece I love  it I think this is one of the best firstperson shooters ive ever playedIts awesome if you love Metal Gear Solid especially the first oneas much as I do  Packed with unlockables like the ability to play as Grey Fox  Big time investment however which is a good or bad thing depending on how you look at itIn  Hideo Kojima single handedly changed the scope of gaming with one game Metal Gear Solid  Within Metal Gear Solid there were ten VR Missions  Surprisingly people spent a lot of time with these VR missions trying to clear them as fast as possible and honing their skills  When word of this got out Konami developed Metal Gear Solid VR Missions  A game that consisted of nothing but VR missions for the gamers that wanted them

If anyone expected any story out of VR Missions youd probably wonder what they were thinking because VR Missions doesnt have a story  The game is exactly what it says it is VR Missions  Metal Gear Solid VR Missions consist of over  missions  At first you can only do very basic missions including the same ten that were included in Metal Gear Solid  As well as training with weapons  The more missions you complete the more that will open up including missions that can get into the bizarre like fighting a giant soldier and super soldiers

In terms of variety Metal Gear Solid VR Missions does a great job  There are so many different varied missions here to keep you busy  Youll also be able to unlock the Ninja and a couple of other secrets although none of these things is very lucrative  While its great to play as the Ninja the controls are a little sloppy and there are only three incredibly short missions  As I said however there are a ton of VR Missions here to keep you busy for a long time

Visually VR Missions is on par with the original Metal Gear Solid the only real problem being that they didnt opt to create more different looking levels  So much of the stages look fairly generic save for a few missions where youll find yourself in some familiar looking areas from Metal Gear Solid  You can only stare at virtual space for so long  Much of the music sounds very good though  While the soundtrack isnt exactly huge it plays a good part in letting the player know that through and through this is not an action game  It is definitely a puzzle game

There are two things about Metal Gear Solid VR Missions that can cause some alarm though  The first being that many missions are fairly short meaning that this game only really serves as an expansion of Metal Gear Solid  Its a mystery why Konami didnt just start packing it in with the original game after a while  It never really happened  The second huge problem is that the game advertises that it has  missions  What they dont mention is that many of those missions are the same  Youll undergo one mission and then be expected to do it again in a Time Attack  To the developers this serves as two different missions but its the same mission  The only difference is that youll be doing it with an additional challenge

As a puzzle game Metal Gear Solid VR Missions is fantastic  It gets repetitive having to do some of the same missions over and over and it may only really just be an expansion of one of the bonuses in Metal Gear Solid but it still serves as a fantastic game for those who crave to do more VR MissionsMetal Gear Solid VR Missions  Circa

ADDITIONAL NOTES

 The Cyber ninja is a playable character if only for a few missionsFirst of all  missions sounds like alot but after playing it for a while you realize that you have completed more than you thought You are training in a VR world with Solid Snake and other characters like Meryl and the Ninja Although the Ninja only has  missions they are pretty fun You can use alot of different weapons in different areas But the reason I gave it only  stars is because the first one has a really in depth story and this one is just training I recommend that you play the first one to really have fun with this oneThis game doesnt have a story But that is actually a good thing VR Missions is great for those of us who have to wedge game playing between an everchanging schedule Most levels take anywhere from  seconds to five mintues and you can exit anytime and save your game So if you have to get up and run you really havent lost anything if you take ten seconds to exit and save
It has all the classic moves from MGS and some fun levels like Mystery arrest the right murder suspect Puzzle think enemydominos and round after round of weaponbased combat so you dont ALWAYS have to sneak around
Id say pick this one up with a tendollar price tag there isnt much of a reason not toI have always been a DieHard MGS fan so I had to buy this game It was very appealing at first beacuse the missions deliver a proffesional touch to yoursnakes abilities The proves to be challenging and requires a quick tactical sort of brain
The game needs to be played bye someone who can devote time to play it also as it gets very frustrating at certain times I found my self beating the controller on the floor at times do to having to try over and over and over again to beat a level that is extremely intimadating
This game would have made a better prerealease game because it prepares you for the most grueling parts of MGS So if your a new comer to the MGS series get this game first its ideal for training you for the real gameAfter playing Heroes of Might and Magic  for years I was excited about Heroes  But after I got the game I thought it was just Heroes  all over again All that was really done to the game was add several creature take away a few creatures mix the towns up a little and slap better graphics on it Though I must admit that it was just as fun and pehaps even more fun than Heroes  One of the greatest things about this game is the plot and story much better than Heroes  If youre thinking of buying this game and dont have Heroes  then know that it can be very addicting If you do have Heroes  then only buy this game if you want better graphics and a few new creatures then go ahead and get itThis normally takes a long time and is purely strategybased  There are at least  different creatures you can fight with each with special abilities and statistics  You send heroes to bring these creatures around the map to gain resources experience artifacts and other treasures  Then you use your cities to make more creatures  Generally the idea is to wipe out your opponents in stunning turnbased battle sequences  The heroes are generally few and they often just explore and wipe out uncontrolled creatures which may flee attack you join you or offer themselves for hire  The games take a long time depending on the map at least  hours  You can make scenarios and the editor is pretty friendly  I recommend this game for people who want a slowpaced strategic challengeIm giving this game  Stars out of the gate because its pretty much just like MM  and thats definitely a good thing MM  in my opinion is one the the best in the series and so far  has got me wanting to continue more of the late night session i spent with its predicessor Oh and by the way if you are having trouble getting this game to runread on a few reviews down if you are reading the reviews in order of the date reviewed youll see a very simple solution shared by one of the reviewers that works Fret notthe game does run on XPyoull just have to have a little Know How and a little patienceDarviusIf you love castlesgoblinsmonsters demon vixens and skeletons swinging swords this game is for you I thought the graphics were excellent and solving the levels wasnt difficult Some may fine the dismemberments a little to gross but my kids enjoyed ityep ya guessed it you get in a car and crash every other car to bits in various arenasyou can win more of them latereach with thier unique capabilitiessome are fastsome are strong etcthe most well protected one is the ambulance for in destruction derby modeif racingtake the hot rodif you cant handle ittry the rocketduring the actual gameyou race against time but theres also a bunch of other cars racing alsoyou get points by damaging other vehicles and by making checkpointseach time you make oneyou get more timehowever the time is less and less every timeeventualy all cars will be destroyed or you will not make your timeplaying here is how you win other cars or in time triali just use codesthis game is great un the whole family can enjoyI am a longtime MM devotee I played every game of this gorgeous series On the last MM  it is put on a new high level But in this sequel it seems to do the same thing without new surprise To be fair  this game is still lots of fun I like the storyline very much in the  game whevever you are so careful you MUST choose your route between good  or evil and then become the foe and the killer of the other side This is  life And numerous quests make you always has something to do The most  disadvantage of this game is the unnecessary lots of monsters I hate  myself doing the same thing again and again accept a guest kill the  monsters get the item In fact I am not killing the monster Im killing  my time If DO company know this this game and the following  sequelsMM  would be far more better But alas I just  purchased a copy of MM  and the monsters seem to be even far moreOk I remember playing this game a long time ago and LOVING it But after installing the latest patches and giving it another go I have to wonderWHO decided to make the enemies be able to shoot you from so far away
  Whoever did that and made that decisionruined the game I am going to uninstall the patch and play again and see if it changes things because I swear it wasnt like that when I played it the first time around I will update after trying it sans patch

UPDATE the problem wasnt the patch it was my memory My apologies to any this review affected prolly like  people lol This is a great classic game and I hope you try itI like this game a lot The multiplayer either skirmish or with some friends is among the best out there The game allows for many different ways to attack like ground invasion missiles air strikes artillery fire or just nuke the enemy bases Plus every attack has a defense so good players can stop just about every attack against them This can lead to very long matches with no clear cut winners

The largest flaw with this game is its age The engine doesnt allow zooming in or out Most commanding happens through the minimap which can take some adjusting However a more advanced engine that supports Total Annihilation maps and mods has been released Its named TA Spring I highly recommend that engine as well Aside from the engine there were no major flaws to this game It is one of the best RTS games ever madeI have owned this game for several years and decided to buy another copy for a friend

Strategy is somewhat the most important role but knowing what to build and what to destroy

An annoying thing I realized is that sometimes you just cant defeat the other opponent even if you rush in with  aircrafts if vehicles kbots or ships cannot do so There are times when it will seem to be like a tie and I save the game and deal with it later Im talking about playing against the comp btwPlaying against other players is great when you learn more about the game

There are some overpowered items in this game so I find that if you attack in smaller mobs than come in in a large group you might be able to slow down their building of weapons When they have the most advanced weaponsrobots you cant really beat them and neither can they beat you as you would probably have the top items as well Thats the only problem I really found in this game against the computer

This is an amazing game and youll be playing it for hours since its so much fun Some weapons are really cool and you basically just own tons of enemies with them I find ships useful for defense since some have powerful or fast attacks Vehicles are what I used for to attack in smaller groups Bombing aircrafts literally wipes out a group while only sacrificing a few of your own robots

If your into strategy action games you must own this or at least play it a couple of times Whats more fun than blasting metal while using your brain to defeat themI had too get this game cuz I mess up my  password on ps I forgot to write it down on piece of paper I cant signed in to ps make sure you write it down The game isnt bad it all I like it  not too bad I like the story and the sound great gameI adore the entire Metal Gear series except for the first two games in the s  This game is greatawesome story very believable too great cutscenes terrible graphics but thats how it was for the time and ok combat  I had to take off one star for the following reasons

  The combat  Its just oksometimes the controls stick and its tough to get up from a crawl and Snake sometimes backs up against walls you didnt mean him to back up onto  The aiming can take a bit to get used to as well

  You will dieA LOTthe game is not very easy on the easy setting either  The worst part is that you have to go through all the cutscenes again if you die during a boss encounter  Very very annoying

and lastly

  The Psycho Mantis battle is AWFUL but only if you got this game off PSN on the PS  The controller port switching doesnt work at all and it takes a good half hour or so to kill him  Youll find the battle to be very frustrating because of this  I dont understand why this happens but after performing a search for the issue online its clearly well documented  I dont know why they havent fixed it

In any case the game deserves  stars for setting the benchmark for all future games to follow it but the above concerns are worthy of a star deductionReplayed this game after  years of being pissed off at myself with this game Was pretty short in todays standards but got to relive nostalgia and finally beat this gameFor metal gear solid fans this is how Metal gear solid started getting popular worth the money played this game when I was a kidI bought this game for a friend of mine for Christmas He really likes it and thats all I wantedGame arrived quickly and works well Being new to console gaming I really did not know what I was missing The game is very challenging and is right on timeMetal Gear Solid  Circa

ADDITIONAL NOTES

 There was a remake of this game for Nintendos Gamecube called Metal Gear Solid The Twin Snakes

 Metal Gear Solid is not the first but the third Metal Gear game in the Metal Gear franchise previously there was Metal Gear and Metal Gear Snakes Revenge on the NES

 The game Metal Gear Solid VR Missions was a spin off from Metal Gear Solids training VR missions

 There is also a version of this game for PCAfter eight years without a new Metal Gear game this franchise got its third entry with Metal Gear Solid The graphics have not aged well at all Textures are very pixellated animation is very jerky and the framerate can get rather slow at times The audio however has lots of great dialogue combined with a catchy musical score

The gameplay is based around stealth You are Solid Snake a spy working for a secret agency whose objective is to stop a device called Metal Gear and save a couple of old guys The story is deeper than that of course but in a nutshell thats it The controls while laid out well can be very unresponsive at times The game itself is very fun sneaking around to either get past or silently eliminate enemies but is very easy to complete and take away all of the cinematics and dialogue  hours of it all and youve got just three hours of gameplay

Metal Gear Solid hasnt aged well at all but is still very fun and happens to be a nice collectors piece for fans of the series But should you start here No grab a GameCube and Metal Gear Solid The Twin Snakes a nextgen remake of this instead then grab Metal Gear Solid  Substance on the PS or the XboxI absolutely fell in love with this game when I first played The story can get a little confusing at times but thats no reason not to get this game This game uses stealth which really makes it fun for a number of reasons The graphics in this game are a little cliche but then again it came out in  and its for PS come on Only problem its way too short If there would have been say another  or  hours added to the game I would have given this game a  But due to its lack of lenght I give it a out of I got a good deal on this game  I purchased it  at a local retailer and the thought if it sucks im not out much went through my mind  I brought it home and installed it not expecting much out of this game  Once I started playing though I was blown away  This is a great game in the spirit of Diablo  and Nox  You start out as a revenant a resurrected spirit with no recollection of your past  You must fight an evil cult and rescue the kings daughter at least I think he was a king i didnt really pay much attention because the dialogue is annoying in this game
Aside from the annoying dialogue and it is very annoying the rest of the game rocks  The way spells are cast is interesting and different from normal games where scrolls are memorized or written in a magic book  The melee combat is good because your character has  different attacks instead of the one slash attack in Diablo   Granted he cant learn a whirlwind attack or leap attack but who cares  Thats not realistic anyway
The graphics and sound are both very good  The only problem is sometimes I have difficulties picking up items off the ground especially if they are hidden behind the leaves of a tree  Also sometimes you will get stuck behind a rock or the edge of a fence line and it takes a bit to get unstuck but you never remain there forever
I also like the way I can see enemies on my map so if my health is very low and I have no food or potions I can avoid them making my way back to town
This game is worth as much as   I might have given it a few more dollars if it werent for the annoying dialogueOriginally attracted by the box which youve got to admit is one of the bestlooking around Id been thinking of buying Revenant for ages but considered it vastly overpriced unlike Black Isle games which seem to drop in price by at least half when theyve been out for a remarkably short while  Recent lower pricing along with the long wait for the release of Baldurs Gate  saw me grabbing a copy loading it up and setting off on a short but immensely enjoyable quest It turned out to be a great time filler
In the single player mode your character is Locke DAveram dead for  years but because of unique skills brought back onto the mortal coil to rescue the kidnapped daughter of the head honcho of Misthaven the main town on the island of Ahkuilon by a mysterious magician with surprise surprise his own agenda  During his quest aspects of Lockes past gradually reveal themselves and his visions start making sense by the end  Sounds like a poor mans Planescape Torment you might think but since nothing can compare to that epic forget it and judge it on its own merits
Likened by many to Diablo this game is superior in that it actually has a reasonably compelling storyline though badly voice acted and the combat system is not your average hacknslash  you learn new battle techniques from the master as you advance  The use of a game pad is strongly recommended though I survived all the combat encounters by pounding the hell out of my keyboard while moving about with the mouse  The scenery is beautifully rendered the lighting is a real feature and animation of Locke and his enemies is superb though a tad repetitious  like the giant spiders getting stuck on the sword and having to be removed with obvious difficulty hilarious the first time the death gurgles of the ninja guys got old very quickly
This is the only game Ive played lately where you can carry everything you find  there dont seem to be any weight limits and there are millions of slots especially once you have a few pouches which you really need to negotiate the huge inventory you end up with I had about  full suits of armour at the end  I was too scared to sell any in case I needed their special properties  Even though the armourer and weapon smith promise bigger and better equipment you actually find the best stuff during the quest though you need to buy some stuff to start off with  Unlike many other games except at the very beginning I always had enough cash to buy any potions etc that I needed  In fact at the rather abrupt end I had about  unused potions of various sorts and about   Also your character is usually strong enough and well enough equipped to survive most encounters pretty easily  I found the fact that he wasnt constantly being killed quite refreshing  None of the puzzles were too taxing though I had to redo one level for the want of one vial
Even though the price was reduced it was still fractionally more than I paid for Planescape Torment or for that matter Baldurs Gate each of which provided rich and stimulating entertainment for a couple of months  I spent exactly a week getting to the end of Revenant and since Id been having such fun I was totally unprepared for it  Remember how disappointing the end of Diablo was  Ditto for Revenant  the final encounter was quite easy for my impressively armoured wellarmed and richly provisioned character and the whole thing was quickly wrapped up in a movie sequence  It left me feeling the story was only half told and that the developers just suddenly decided to get it to some sort of conclusion and out in the shops while they got on with something else  I wish theyd just gone on with the next chapter  despite any shortcomings mentioned above I thoroughly enjoyed it  This is the game to play when youre half concentrating on something else  in my case LIVE coverage of the Sydney OlympicsThis was a decent game  Probably one of the first of its kind so that gets it major points  Its a little on the short side  hours total if you watch all the cinematics and take your time and the difficulty takes dramatic leaps and falls throughout the game making adaptation difficult  The graphics are absolutely horrible but maybe im just spoiled by my ps  The voice quality isnt bad for a game as old as this one and the moves and strategy you can use are all immensely helpful as opposed to some games that give you neat moves that have absolutely no application in the game  Very originalIve just read some reviews for the game all over the net  Everyone is trashing itand I really dont understand why  Is there a certain rule that bargain games cannot be good  Must a game cost fifty bucks for it to be good  Thats what all magazine reviews seem to be leaning towards  Dont listen to them its just their opinion anyway  Theyre a bunch of spoiled babies who sit there and get paid to write ridiculous reviews on games like DS  I just got the game today wanted to check out what it was like and surprisingly I found myself playing it for  hours  Bottom line is that if you like Diablo you will probably like this game  Same style same type of dungeons same everything  Dont be fooled by those spoiled losers that work for these magazines who are trashing this game in their reviews  Just because its not made by Squaresoft doesnt mean it cannot be fun  Ive had more fun playing this game than I did Vagrant Story and that got great reviews  Thats the last time Ill trust magazine reviewsits all opinions  Cant lose pricewise on this one and even if you dont like it as much you wont be banging your head against the wall for buying the editors choicepick and finding out that a supposedly bigger more expensive game is no different graphically than the one Im writing this review for
Heres the rundown on the game  worst   best
Graphics   Weve seen better graphics on playstation but hey this wasnt meant to be state of the artthen again neither was Frogger but we played that for months now didnt we
Control  Can you rotate the camera view at any time in Vagrant Story  I think not  Buttonsmashing as some of the reviews claim Not at all  Movement could feel more realistic but were not here to complain
Fun Factor  After spending  hours with the game its about as much fun as Diablo was when I opened up the game and popped it in for the first time  How much longer will this last  Who knows
Music  Average sounds nothing phenomenal
In true Amazon fashion I give this game  out of  starsTHis game invented stealth to the gaming industry Plus it porved that you could be a badass in a video game Unfortuantly no one who has played MGS is gonna go play MGS And thats a shame because MGS almost beats the nd one Better gameplay Yes theres a lot more action stealth is more important and theres more gameplay than movie The storys pretty normal until the end It seems like a regular terroist movie turned into a game However there are some bad things compared to the nd one Bad graphics cant shoot in First person mode and you dont have a tranquilizer Oh well this is Playstation  They improved on MGS but only a littleThis is probably one of the best PlayStation One games there is This has the best storyline of all again the characters are coolthe music is okay and the action kind of blows What I mean is that unlike MGS you cant switch to firstperson mode and use your gun and Revolver Ocelot is kind of lame to fight  chasing someone in circles is not my idea of an exciting gunfight and you cant zoom in or out when using the sniper rifle also cant use it while standing Still it is a good game but the sequel is better Not a bad gamebut could have been improvedThis ones my favorite out of the first  and I liked them all couldnt get into Chronicles or the others after This one has the best looking tombs in the series and theres more tombs here than any of the others until you get to the City of the Dead more than halfway through Then the game changes quite a bit It becomes dark and dreary

Puzzles are harder here Many times you have to reenter levels to solve them Itll take patience But its all Egypt and really interesting On the other hand you can save anywhere and theres far more items you can find in LR compared to the previous three You really have to be doing something wrong to run out of items

Four stars for this cause like I said the City of the Dead the game changes dramatically all the way to the end But the first  of this game was excellent

Just want to respond to those who complain about the controls The controls in this game is no different than the previous TR games Rope swinging was difficult but other than that it is the same You can complain about TRs control scheme all together but those who didnt mind will enjoy this and its not just because the fanboys like her exaggerated assets either Im more a roleplayer than an action gamer but theres enough character involved in the Tomb Raider series to keep me interested
Laras adventures follow the same basic mold as The Mummy or the Indiana Jones movies she goes poking about in ancient sites and gets involved in Things Man Was Not Meant To Know and that Woman Was Meant To Put Right apparently Being actionoriented the game gives you a wide range of motion and does a nice job of making you feel the difficulty and danger of some of her feats  jumping over pits filled with spikes swinging on ropes over chasms climbing sheer cliffs swimming through sharkinfested waters and so on In The Last Revelation the dark Egyptian god Set is unleashed upon the world partly through Laras ending up somewhere she shouldnt have been and so Lara has to put a stop to his rampage Normally one human against a god would be a silly idea but then again the last time Set was loose human beings didnt have fully automatic weapons bazookas and grenades
The game fails to get a perfect rating from me based on my own preferences and skills Firstly because it IS an action game many of its challenges are based simply on your being good enough to do some particular set of actions very very well Im not the greatest in the world at doing some of the more complex sequences and this means that it can take a frustratingly long time to get past one challenge  in some cases days to either figure out the precise sequence of moves which will get me from one point to the next or to actually perform the sequence of moves once Ive figured it out Timing is critical and restarting the game from the last saved point can take an annoying amount of time
Secondly because Im more a roleplayer I find the lack of choices in actions somewhat stifling Yes I would as a rule choose to go and do the heroic thing but you dont really get any choice to even be reluctant go get help or anything else You work alone you volunteer automatically and so on
Still playing a couple of Lara Crofts adventures showed me why this series still continues it delivers exactly what it promises and does so with panacheI have enjoyed this game very much Its fun and exciting and the story is a big step up from the previous games Graphics wise this game has a few improvements added but otherwise its similiar to   
  Problems include glitches falling through walls and losing saves in fact that is the only thing keeping me from finishing the game The rope swinging is also a problem Its hard getting it to swing as is aiming
Graphics 
Sound 
Control 
Fun Demolition Racer is quite similar to the Destruction Derby games  previously released for the Playstation  Its different modes of play makes  this game stand out from the previous DD games and gives Demolition Racer  the ultimate replay value
Each car handles differently but seems to  control near perfectly when using Dual Shock Analog Controller  Your  overall objectives in the league modes is to finish first and to score the  most points  What can be better than slamming into the car in front of you  and taking them out of the race  You will find yourself trying to score  more and more points by wiping out the competion  This is a very fun  aspect of this game
There are a nice variety of tracks and cars to chose  from and the different modes of play breaks up any repetition  The Arena  mode in this game is nearly identical to the Bowl levels in Destruction  Derby  and  however instead of getting to visit the Bowl at the end of  each level the entire levels of play have you moving from one bowl to the  next if you survive It is a really great mode of play trying to survive  and destroy the competition in a rounded bowl arena  Its basically kill or  be killed
Overall Demolition Racer is a blast to play and the replay  value will have you coming back for more  Its a fun game and at  bucks  its a stealThief The Dark Project in my opinion was pretty tedious compared to the fastmoving sequel It started out fine but it got really dull and annoying when I reached the zombieinfested parts of the game which include levels like Down in the Bonehoard and The Haunted Cathedral I loved it at first seeing new types of opponent apart from the usual guards but the fun dies out pretty quickly because of the level structure This isll be a complete nuisance if the difficultys set on Expert The objectives of levels which have zombies and burricks are pretty demanding and theyre all not located in convenient places It requires a lot of going back and forth which means that sometimes you face the enemies all over again as its impossible to kill more than  especially since they move around in groups so a quick glance dart and hide is done mostly throughout the game

The other levels are pretty civilized which involve reasonable objectives and most of these are taken place in the City where its mostly guaranteed you wont see mythical monsters like the zombies and the burricks

The reason why this game mainly revolves around these monsters is because of the storyline Garrett the thief you play finds himself being involved with dark Pagan rituals people who worship the forces of nature and live in woods

The graphics and lighting are amazing and really set the atmosphere I recommend this game but a getting a lot from it is not to be expectedTheif The Dark Project

Being a theif you rely on darkness hence a visiblity gauge  If it is bright then you are in to much light  Theif also has a sound gauge  If your walking to fast or on noisy floors like metal grating tiles or gravel the noise will be much greater
The game runs smoothly and is very immersive thanks to the great sound effects and good graphics for the time  One thing that some reviewers overlook is the stat summary at the end of the level  It is a nice to see your total and level timeloot killed bodys knocked out bodys and discoverd bodysyou can pick up the bodys and hide them to reduce suspicion of other guards  This adds to the feeling of not just going level to level and actually working for a goal  A goal which could simply be saving money to buy equipment at the start of the next level
Levels are layed out nice  With this point alot of people complain about the zombie levels  Is that because its not realistic  Not a setting that a theif would normally be put into  Or the fact that they scare the  out of you  I will never forget the first time I played the second level and saw a corpes I bent down to inspect it  Well what do you know It started getting up and let out a grotesque moan
The sound makes this game  Without it the game would be reduced significantly  With that said use headphones and play it in the dark Your heart will race and you will jump when guards see you or you come across something you where not perpared for
Playablity  Play it every once in awhilelike combat flight sim and it will keep your interest  With the total time stat it will give you an incentive to try to beat your old time
Bottom Line   stars for a truly immersive game even compared to the glamour of the newer games  Get it  It deserves to be in your collection and will not set you back any moneyFear Effect is excellent  The graphics are fun the storyline is great the gameplay is exciting  It is the best game I have played in a while
THE DOWNSIDE The game has very little replay value and it is not  very long  It only took a few hours to beat  The game IS fun though   once I beat it I went right back to play through in Hard Mode  After  that though there was nothing more to the game
VERDICT  You should  definitely rent this game if it interests you at all you will not be  disappointed  I would not recommend buying it thoughFear Effect is a fun game that is challenging and quite good value for just   The game is sometimes very tricky though  Some puzzles go beyond hard as the game progresses  The bosses and enemies are already hard in the first levels  The game goes by pretty quick even with the challenge though  Buy this game if you want a good animated action game that will leave you wanting to play Fear Effect This was a rebought purchase as I lost my original copy This one works wonderfully and much better than my older one despite the lost files on it that I had to recreateSpec Ops Stealth Patrol puts you in the life of a ranger This proves to be quite the task The first level turns out to be amazingly hard with enemies running around EVERYWHERE and almost no medipacks at your  disposal The solution Call a friend and beat the game in twoplayer mode  It turns out that its a really really fun game Kneeling and laying on  your stomach become your best friend when dodging enemy fire Learning to  search around the area and sneaking up on soldiers shows that medipacks  are equaly spread throughout levels Choose your men wisely as some  missions need someone that can use a scope to take out those irresistible  mines The graphics sound and game mechanics are really great for only the price The only drawback I have is that when youre calling your buddy to  follow you he can get hung up on things like trees or cliffs and the  game could go much smoother without mines on every inch of ground Overall  your  bucks couldnt go to better use Nothing feels better than seeing  an Iraqi through your scope or watching the little red sights appear on a  VietKongIf you are familiar with the Harvest Moon series or even if you are not and you enjoy RPGSimulation games this game is a good addition to your collection  In Harvest Moon  you play as a guy who gets to run a farm and have a personal life
The method of farming in this game is completely done by your character you till the land plant the seeds and water them until plants grow  And you have to do everything in  minutes and  seconds because you wake up at  am hours in this game are  seconds long and the person that picks up the crops comes at  pm  However time does not pass while you are in buildings  If you do to much without eating or sleeping sleeping brings you to the next day you will not be able to use tools
Compared to the Harvest Moon for the Super Nintendo this game has a good number of new features
 Tools powerup with the amount of times they are used as apposed to completing a certain event in the game that gives you a stronger tool
 You have to buy your groceries the food you automatically eat when you wake up and at noon
 You can raise sheep  The money comes from their wool
 There are new competitions that include racing your dog or horse
I could go on and on about the new aspects of HM
However in HM there is a lot of misparagraphed text and there are also some bugs in the game  One bug in particular that I have found is that at some point in the game Elles grandmother may die if you talk to her usually during spring  Make sure this never happens on a day when something is happening New Years etc or your game will freeze
Even with the bugs try to avoid them this game still stands out as a great real life video gameThis is the first video game Ive played with no violence It even encourages and insists on making sure you are loving to your animals You play a farmer and keep busy raising crops different kinds in different seasons taking care of your animals attending festivals and more You decide how much work you do I recently had to cut down for myself I was too busy This game is addictive but I did get to a point where I wondered if I had any more goals to strive for because after awhile feeding and brushing your animals day after day gets mundane Then I realized I could have a carpenter add on to my house so I am busy collecting lumber every day Your farmer can get too tired and even get sick so be careful how much work you do This game would be very appropriate for children as it teaches responsibility and lets them choose what they want to accomplish and everyone in the game is nice to you Good for adults too of course A peaceful change from highstrung action gamesOf all the war games me and my sons have played  This was by far the one of the most fun I loved how the enemy soldiers were programmed to respond to noises and attacks very realistic No matter how many times we played a level trying to get off it never got dull because the enemies didnt respond always the same It was very fun making mistakeslike accidentally throwing grenades at my partner or setting explosives to close and for getting to tell my partner The only disapointment was not enough levels but for the price this game was well worth itForget the standard Final Fantasystory line In Thousand Arms you play as Mice Triumph a letcherous young man on a quest to regain his kingdom and woo any young woman in his path The game features the best voice overs in any game the Playstation has ever made and the graphics are a culmination of Lunar  and Final Fantasy VII For anyone who wants to have a wonderful story in the tradition of anime and laugh for hours at some of the funniest dialoge yet then look no farther then Thousand Arms Warning the game while not anymore violent then any of the Lunar games does contain quite a few sexual innuendos partly spawning form the unique system of this game where you can go on dates with each girl and try to win her over This game is suggested for an audience  and upFirst off im just gonna say that this game is very weird one of the most unique games ever You will probably never play any game like this unless there is a sequel This is because of the way you learn new spells you date women This is very funny because of what they ask and their different reactions and it is in dialogouge and interactive anime My complaints are in the battle system factor it is just kinda dumb Your three characters are lined up in a row and when on dies the other comes in so you only fight with one character at a time This game is very fun and it can help all those desperate guys out there who arent gettin any action I do love the CROC series As though this game may seem pretty difficult to play and not have a very good game rating score But to me i like challenges This adventure is definitely a one in a time classic Who cannot love their favorite toony crocodile character in this game I like him Hes funny and cool I am not saying this is the best game I had tough times with it when i was just a child but now its a piece of cake I would consider people trying this gameDont buy this for very young ones because it will be too hard for them When Croc runs its very sencitive so when you tap left Croc will do a full turn You will die because health is limited but you will get used to this if youre truely talented at games My first game was Crash Bandicoot back in and on my first go I could control the character with ease and I beat my friends at games when they had a Playstation for  years My point is if youve a sondaughter and theyve got a simular story and theyre talented at games then get this after Croc  and I know adults will enjoy this as well
I dont think Croc  wasnt released because Croc  was rubbish
If you like this checkout Crash Bandicoot 
Tenchu this isnt for kidsIt can get very stupid at times but there is a lot of fun in the game and many funny parts in it as well Females might get offended by some of the dateing parts in the game but please remember its only a game ok even if the game is a bit pigish Very good cartoon graphicsFirst off Id like to thank Jaleco for the effort they put into making this game  Its not the greatest in the world of survival entertainment but it was a good first effort and I wanted to acknowledge that  The game has a fair amount of good and bad points and Im going to go over all of them starting with the bad just to get them out of the way and to end this review on more of a high note since I did enjoy this game more than I didnt enjoy it
 The obvious bad point was the voices and voice acting  The main character Jack had almost no inflection in his voice no matter what he was talking about or doing  I would have liked to have been able to turn his voice off and have just read what was going on it was so annoying at times  Plus watching his mouth still move for a long time after he was finished talking was a true annoyance  I did get used to him after about an hour but I wish they had found someone who could have showed just a little more emotion
 The graphics were a bit chunky and blocky at times too and the camera angles were almost too excessively annoying especially going around corners where if you were the character you would be able to see down the hall but the view they give you on the screen is still a third person look and you cant see down the hall until you actually start moving down it
 Okay now onto the good  The weapon selection in the game isnt all that big but you do get what you need to accomplish your goals so I dont really have a complaint about that  As a matter of fact I liked the fact that you were given a weapon that had unlimited use  Its called a welderwhy I dont know and seems strange to be a weapon but its very effective against single zombies and some of the smaller creatures you run across  This allows you to save your ammunition for some of the tougher zombies and the bigger monsters you run into later  I never came close to running out of ammunition by using the welder a lot early in the game when the creatures were weaker
 Another good thing was the BEMT scope which you are given early in the game  This device allows you to look at people and tell if they are still human or have been affected by the Ark virus  It also allows you to see through lockers through plants to look for hidden doors and also helps negate the bad camera angles you will suffer when going around corners I would walk around a corner and then pull out the scope to check down the hall because you are then given a first person view and can check for hiding creatures
 Another bonus was an unlimited inventory so you didnt have to stockpile weapons or health drinks or anything else  You were able to carry everything you picked up without having to fuss about whether or not you really needed to carry it at that time and then run back somewhere to retrieve something you needed when getting to a certain door or area  So kudos to Jaleco for this fine first effort  The story line might have been a bit weak and all my questions about Ark and the motivations of some of the characters werent answered but overall it was a good try and the next time they might make a more polished complete product  Im willing to wait and seeHonestly I am only getting this to play for a while and add to the collection It was pretty good but nothing like GTA  and laterThis was definitely how I remember this game Classic played it a lot when I was a youngster and decided to get some classics backFolks this is THE GTA my generation grew up with not the cheesy D versions that exist today While I do not dismiss the greatness that comes with D the D birds eye view was a great experience at the time and even today The game was pure fun with little decadence compared to the modern installments
The PC version is much better though but do not get it from Steam if you own an old PC equipped with a Dfx accelerator because the Steam version does not come with Dfx supportOkay I use to have Harvest Moon for the GBC and in the game you talk to alot of people you get a pet and you do a bunch of farming all in all its a really great game and can be played on the GBC Original GBA and GBA SP  So if you like farming and talking in games then get this game youll really enjoy when I first got this game from a friend I couldnt put it down for almost over a month  Oh and plus theres a photo album in the game that you have to play the game for a while to unlock each picture and if you have a Game Boy Printer which you can get off here amazon then you can print out your pictures and you can play as a girl or a boy in the gameI played this game a long time ago And I am reviewing it just because i am currently playing GTA 
This game reeks with coolness But me and most other gamerspeople want to know how this game managed to get a Teen rating It is just as gory and profained as GTA
Here is how I rate GTA

Overall  eight out of tenI am a Tetris fan and playing on the playstation is no exception I bought it used but still a favorite of mineWhen it comes to the Playstation there are games that have improved when they were remade for the Playstation  and there are games that look and play far better in the Playstation  version and Tetris Plus is one of them  Unlike Tetris Worlds where you may get different modes of the game it didnt feel like I got as much to offer or only so much of the feel of Tetris when I tried this game for myself  On the other hand Tetris Plus had the more colorful classic mode the puzzle mode with  different puzzles not to mention the option to create and try your own puzzles and the vs mode to test your skills against another player and all had the exact feel and challenge of tetris as I remembered it  If you want a tetris game for your Playstation this is by far still the better choiceBecause of the new Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks game coming out I decided to get all my old MK games out to play Among them was Mortal Kombat Mythologies SubZero and this lil gem Despite what everyone has had to say about the game Special Forces isnt that bad a game I mean if youre any MK fan at all youre going to get this one just to keep up with the Mortal Kombat mythos I especially enjoyed the game because it explained alot of the backstory as to how Jax and Sonya first got into MK Ill admit however why they chose Jax to have a starring role in an MK game of his own is beyond me Not that Jax is a bad character and fighter in the game hes one of my favorites Its just there are other more beloved characters from the universe that they could have used When you think about it that could be the reason why people didnt make this a big seller at the time At any rate I loved the game For the first time it was a Mortal Kombat game that took place in an actual D environment Fighting is intense with the basic special and combination moves

The only reason why I gave the game  stars was because of certain control issues it had They really hindered my enjoyment getting into the game at times

Other than that Mortal Kombat Special Forces is an awesome game Its a game any respectable Mortal Kombat fan would and should add to their collectionFinal Doom is really the third Doom game so Doom  is really Doom  Anyway This game is great Thirty brand new levels with tons of tricks and surprises The only drawbacks are that there are some invisible walls which demons can attack you through but entering these walls can be fun Also it seems like you can never pick up a key or open a door without a wall opening up with a dozen monsters behind it ready to attack you But the gameplay is flawless I highly recommend this gameThe  new  level episodes for DooM  should not be bought for the pc Whyyou askFor oneback when it was madeyou had to pay    bucks for only when you could download more than  times that much levels off the internet Like a growing athleteit is time for Doom to say goodbye to the spotlight
Buy this for PS if you dont have a pcwait Everyone has a PCIf you are a lawsuit happy whacko stay away from this one Its not for the family unless you happen to be in the Manson family This game is a one player st person shooter There is a cable link option and if you are  lucky enough to have two TVs two game consols and two game CDs then you  can have some real battles same goes for the original DOOMas you blast  your way through violent disguised communists or declare war on your  playing partner There are several levels and most get a little tougher as  you finish each level The music can be turned off to make the setting even  more realistic Lots of suprises and weapons keep this body count classic  fresh Nothing like a point blank double barrel shotgun blast to the face  to really make you mad A great deal at this price for sureUNLIKE THE EARLIER MK GAMES THIS ONE FEATURED SOME D GRAPHICS AND IT ALSO HAS WEAPONS WHICH ARE AVAILABLE TO USE OR THROW AT ANYTIME THIS IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE NINTENDO  VERSION BUT ITS A GREAT FIGHTING GAME NONETHELESS AND I THINK ITS BETTER THAN ANY OF THE MORTAL KOMBAT GAMES THATVE BEEN COMING OUT SINCE  GREAT GRAPHICS GREAT CONTROLS AND A FUN PRACTICING MODE WHICH YOU CAN FIGHT FOR HOURS IF YOU WANT TO WITH THE SAME OPPONENT BUT UNFORTUNATELY AFTER THIS ONE THE MORTAL KOMBAT FRANCHISE WENT COMPLETELY DOWNHILLMK finally comes into the D realm in this game I only wish there were more characters and I miss the animalities babalities brutalities and friendships But overall its goodThe only reason I gave this game two stars is because I am an Mortal Kombat Fan but this game sucks  It was way to easy you know I loved mortal kombat trilogy because it was hard as hll and when I beat it I was so happy and said to my self I cant wait till the next game  Yet this is just bad you dont even have to learn the peoples moves any more  You just have to take out your weapon and hackem to death it just sucks Then I went and rentid Mortal KombatDA and I do admit harder then this peice of h t  Yet still the weopons are still there and now you can stab them in the gut and leave it there so the person you fight slowly dies  So what Im saying is stick with  and Trilogy they are way betterI still play this game you if youre a first person shooter you should understand why Doom is still a classic killing game despite the fact that it is an older and out dated play style bested by the newer and hotter lines such as Call of DutyModern Warfare and others like them However I still like this game for  reasons Bazookas BFG and the willies Yes the spine tingling you get when your stare too long at the screen while playing Doom and the music creeps you out some much you need to pause the game to turn on the lights

So turn out the lights load that BFG and blast some hell knights stars because it arrived very quickly its a gift for my friend whose birthday is the th It arrived on the th so I was VERY happy Looking at the disc because I was worried when it said disc shows some wear from use and sure it has some very faint scratches like  maybe but Ive seen deeper scratches in ps games and they still played Hasnt been tested but they are obsessed with doom so they will let me know if theres any problems with the games and I will update So far Im very very very happyI have to admit despite not being a fan of the first person genre I love Doom There is something about the exploits of a lonely space marine singlehandedly taking on the forces of hell that draws me in and refuses to let go Still as enjoyable as Doom and Doom II were these games generally dont deliver on the challenge front for a seasoned player While some may consider that a drawback it was a nonexistent problem to me since challenge isnt the most important thing I look for in a game However for those that do they can easily up the ante with Final Doom

To some Final Doom for the PlayStation will never be anything more than a haphazard potluck This port doesnt contain every level from the two thirtytwo level PC campaigns nor does it contain every level from the twentyone level Master Levels expansion In other words out of pool of eightyfive possible levels only thirty make an appearance here So how does this affect the experience The answer depends on which episode ones talking about and which levels made the cut

Things start out with The Master Levels where thirteen of the possible twentyone levels make up the core of Final Doom These levels are meant to test ones mettle with relentless enemy attacks and complex level design something they do quite well Players will find a level like Vesperas is hard to tackle regardless of what difficulty level their playing on Still the real attraction of the master levels beyond the challenge is the fact the player can carry their status and weaponry from level to level This isnt possible on the PC since the data for each level is its own file something that was purposely done so each map would be considered its own separate entity by players Final Doom on the PlayStation proves how unnecessary this was since each level still feels like a separate experience even though they follow one another

Next up is TNT Evilution the first of the two Doom II followups presented in the PC version of Final Doom Taken as a whole TNT Evilution is an excellent and balanced expansion that just cant make its case with the eleven levels presented here It could have been better with a better selection of levels but its just better to buy a copy of the Doom Collectors Edition for the PC and play it in its entirety Additionally while I have nothing against the ambient score whipped up for the PlayStation versions of Doom I just dont have patience towards it when reflecting back on the wonderful midibased soundtrack Team TNT created for the PC original

Last up is Plutonia with six levels Cruel as it may sound Im absolutely thrilled this episode got the short end of the stick Take the challenge of the Master Levels throw in every cheap shot and tactic in the book and youve got Plutonia in a nutshell Challenge quickly eclipses entertainment when it comes to levels like Congo Ghost Town and Onslaught That said if youre really serious about tackling the hardest levels Doom can throw at you Id again suggest going the PC route so you can save your progress at will Regardless while the levels are still well designed at this point I have no problem billing Plutonia as Dooms weakest and ugliest link

The shortcomings of its experiences aside Final Doom is a worthy and refreshingly different followup to Doom At its simplest level it may be more of the same but those who immerse themselves in what it has to offer will find it contains a feel all its own Its not always fun and some parts are of more value than others The Master Levels being the main draw here but those with a little patience will have little problem in adding this to their collectionFinal Doom is an excellent game I own both Ultimate Doom  Final Doom for the playstation and enjoy playing both of them This game is a lot more exhausting than Ultimate Doom too Most of the levels are huge extremely mazy and difficult so youd better be a good thinker Thats right each level is a dark scary labyrinth of evil soldiers  monsters so youll need to use your brain if you plan to make it out alive The whole key to Doom is survival and its not going to be easy this time The graphics are a bit sluggish which is why I give the game  stars instead of  But everything else sound fx music controls gameplay factor is fine The soundtrack in this game is very disturbing to say the least It helps create an incredibly eerie atmosphere that few games have ever done The sound fx are realistic and the gameplay factor is superb

Do I recommend Final Doom for PS Yes I do So order it now while supplies last or be doomed foreverForgotten amidst the blood of Mortal Kombat and D presentations of Virtua Fighter and Tekken the Street Fighter II series initiated the fighting game craze  Whereas its successors won their fanbases with graphical geegaws Street Fighter IIs strength was superb wellbalanced uncomplicated gameplay that was simple to learn but exhausting to master  Street Fighter Collection accurately reproduces that gameplay making for an excellent anthology but not a flawless one
Firstly the omission of the first three iterations of Street Fighter II is glaring  Given the lack of complexity of those games one has to wonder if Capcoms developers were too lazy or their marketers too greedy to finish those titles for this release instead leaving them for Street Fighter Collection II  Graphically the games are preserved admirably although CD audio forces the game to start each track over when speeding the tempo up unlike in the arcade games  The long load times are excruciating as is each title requiring its own Memory Card block when the high scores for both titles could easily fit into a single block
The inclusion of Street Fighter Alpha  Gold is nice but seems out of place in what is supposedly a historical collection  Perhaps the developers felt they rushed the original Street Fighter Alpha  to market and tried to save face by placing the more polished Gold version in this compilation  And since this third title requires its own Memory Card block Street Fighter Collection actually requires three blocks in all not one as is advertised on the packaging
Still all three games have withstood the test of time and are worth purchasing for gameplay if not historical value  But the aforementioned drawbacks of the Street Fighter II games and dubious packaging do detract from the compilation as a wholeGame came in working order and brought back heaps of nostalgia while playing it Its not the best N game out there in regards to storyline and play modes  infact theres not much you can really do in this game but thats not why I bought it Regardless its still a fun time wasting game to play alone or with friendsthis is a pretty fun game if youre in the mood just to destroy tuff there really is nothing to this just destroying buildings it get boring in a while but its funSome people may think that Monster Rancher is a stupid Pokemon clone with absolutely no entertainment value  They are very wrong  Monster Rancher  is one of my favorite games  You start out by either going to the market and getting a monter or regenerate one yourself by going to the shirne and using a disc stone CD  The main object of the game is to raise and train your monster  You have to decide which stats will benefit your monster the most in a battle  Some monsters are better at some stats than others  For example a Durahan has wonderful power and defense but awful speed  One feature that I really like about this game is that it never ends  To actually beat the game you must beat the Major  tournaments the hardest in the game  Once you do that it doesnt stop  You can combine monsters together to make even more powerful ones  Some monsters arent available at the start of the game but they can soon be unlocked  The only drawback is that MR does get somewhat repetative but its still a great gameThis was a great game that I enjoyed playing a lot The point of the game is to raise a monster You start with a low leveled monster your goal is to make them learn different attacks and win money against other trainers in battles This game is very similiar to Pokemon The only thing I didnt like was after you raise a macho battleready monster that took hours to train it dies Anyway this game is a great gameAlthough this is a great game thats extremely fun you can only play it once  The graphics are ahead of their time not now but they were and when you use a lightgun its a party  But you end up doing the same thing over and over again  Its like you die then just play again so you can die again then repeat  It sort of gets old after a while  If you can get it for a bargain Id say go for it but if its too expensive dont get it because the time youll play it wont be worth the money
Graphics  for their time

Sound  just normal
Overall This game is very good It combines the good things of the original Mortal Kombat with few good things of the later Mortal Kombats such as MK  MK Ultimate It is worth buying if you still play your Playstation or if you are a die hard MK fan and you still want to play it on your PS IF you have oneBefore there was Tekken and Soul Blade and the rest of the current fighters there was Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat  Mortal Kombat was easily the best in terms of richness of the game  The characters moved  fluidly the voices were understandable and there was blood  The series  progressed nicely with great additions and secrets added every step of the  way
This title is a great nostalgic look back at those times  Being  able not only to play any of the characters from the first  games but  also as their different incarnations is huge  When the GenesisSuper  Nintendo became obsolete I feared the loss of these games  But with their  release on Playstation especially in this title I am happy  The game  play is great and packed full of surprises  As far as D fighting games  goes this is the best and is better than many first generation D  fighters  If you liked this in the arcade youll like it here  Granted  it has the usual translation problems with the buttons in the  wrong places  and more difficulty moving the stick but you get those problems with any  console gameI have had this game since it came out too many people see this as a badold game but i remember when this first came outit was  revolutionary this was the ORIGINAL game to use the engine while attitude  was a sequel and ECW just plain copied it If you have a choice though  you should buy its sequel attitudeI love this old arcade games I remember when young playing Defender and Robotron and this disk faithfully
reproduces this games The only diference is that ussing the dualshock controler makes it more dificult than ussing the controlers on the arcade machinesFun update to the classic Though I guess this is a classic now as well Fun to play multiplayer with the kid We both think its hilariousthe game was good but every time i beat the game it never goes anywhere further after defeating the boss plus the music messes up a lot at timesThis was a really good MK game at the time Heck It still is good Its got all the characters from Mortal KombatUltimate MKPlus with the fatalitiesfriendshipsbabalitiesect But there are some problems with this game It does not include EVERY single background from the first gamelike it does with MK II and MKUMK Its got the courtyardthe pitthe pit bottom and Goros dungeonbut where are the rest I found that to be a major issue for me Another problem I had with itis alot of the backgrounds dont have the music in themfrom the original games It seems all kind of shuffled up Lastlyanother little issue isyou cannot perform a stage fatality in the pit that was orginally in MK IIwhich IMOwas the best stage fatality out of the first three gamesIncluding UMKoh and why is Johnny Cage all of a sudden fighting with his shades on But Overall thoughif you can overlook the little flawsI guess this is a good gamebut IMO in could have been somewhat betterKartia The Word Of Fate recognized as Rebus in Japan crams  fabulous innovation in one decent StrategyRPG Although Atlus has released  a few worthy games on the PlayStation console Atlus begins to grow as a  company wholl soon promote their selves into a household name Like the  arising empire of Enix Despite the humiliation from their most  embarrassing game Eggs of Steel Atlus is gaining momentum with their  notnotch RPGs  Taking corresponding steps alike with Ogre Tactics and  my all time precious Final Fantasy Tactics Kartia packs  charming  innovations Sure Kartia may not have the excellent job systems like FFT  or any archers for the matter yet it brings temples of innovations to bury  the burden It has Phantoms Once the player ons his PlayStation the  player selects his  decision to accept the role of Toxe or Lacryma Each  character has a totally different story process  The niddygriddy fun in  Kartia is concentrating on your arsenal of Phantoms They are  paperrockscissors monsters  All phantoms can be defeated by a specific  one and vise versa  Phantoms play the most basic role  During the game  the player uses them to create elemental magic or specialize weapons  Assembling the players own infantry takes a critical job for victory or  instant death The objectives in Kartia are alike with FFTs system From  claiming the lives of your adversaries to escorting a vital character  Kartia has the same fundamentals of any StrategyRPG game  What really  amazes is the addition to disturb the environment Players have the  opportunity to cut down trees down for a bridge and order a magician to  freeze a pool of water for walking  Battling enemies on the vast  terrain is exciting but the game loses some valuable points from being  completely linear Gladly there is another innovation that covers that  burden as well the P Mode Final Fantasy Tactics could have been truly  flawless if Square decided to include the P Mode Kartia takes  StrategyRPGs deeper The P Mode allows two players to battle their armies  on saved data Players can also trade items  The ONLY downslope going  for Kartia is the abrupt end  Kartia is an engrossing story With  a tale like this why not bring an anime in the movie industry  Both  characters have dissimilar story progressions Loxe is a young boy who  enjoys the elegance of swordplay a bit too much Lacryma is an incredibly  robust Shrine Knight Its up to these two heroes to protect the land from  barbaric rebels Heroes fighting the bad rebels may sound dull and boring  but once the backstabs roll in theres no way the player can let the  controller free again Someone anyone make Kartia an anime  Graphically Kartia is a D splendor The vibrant colors hold an artistic  environment When a person speaks a dialogue box is set above the screen  and the characters faces appear At the FMV department the videos are  dark and morbid that triumphantly stimulates your daily dose of eyecandy  Music thrives to hand the player spectacular soundings  The beats can  really adjure you in an edge of your seat thrill  Atlus has succeeded to  create a game that goes beyond the redundant  RPGs today  Dont be fooled  by Kartias age or lack of popularity This is a solid buy  FFT fans run  kill only if necessary to grab a hold of this monster  P mode shines and  awaits for your arrival In return for your forty bucks youll get the  chance to trade items with a friend and get sucked into a extremely  addictive playThe reason i give this game  stars instead of  is because the slow loading times in beetween fights If you owe a PS go to Ps driver and change the texture to smooth and disc speed to fast The loading times are reduced by quiet alot overall this game is great but the morphing of shang tsung can get frustrating because it has to load everytime you morph this game is great for beginners but if you are a true hardcore MK fan get armageddonThis game is really hard You could beat the game with Kintaro and Goro easily When you battle Shao Kahn with Sindel its really hard I still like it thoughThis game is da bomb Forget about Mortal Kombat Trilogy on the Nintendo  The Playstation version blows that one away You get to pick more selectable fighters including Goro Kintaro Motaro Shao Kahn Jax  Kung Lao from MK  and Raiden  Kano from MK  Plus the sound fx and music are equivelant to the smash arcade hit And speaking of the incredible soundtrack you can even stick this disc into your CD player and actually listen to music from the game In other words MKT is both a video game and a music CD Of course this thing is loaded with plenty of blood and violence but that should be a real treat for gore hounds Diehard MK fans will definetly get their moneys worth The options menu offers you some pretty cool stuff including automatic combos Thats right you can do combos simply by tapping one button That rocks The graphics  animation look pretty good for a D game and the controls and gameplay work together nicely However this game does have its cons The game only has one cheat menu which kind of scks The onebuttonfatalities mode messes up sometimes The game itself freezes sometimes and you have to reset the game If you have both a PS and a PS avoid playing this game on your PS Instead play it on your PS This game messes up a lot when played on the PS console Im not sure why but it plays good on the regular PS All of the stage fatalities are here except for the Pit  fatality but I can do without it The bosses are incredibly hard to beat unless you play as one of the bosses yourself You can beat Shao Kahn best with Noob Saibot by shooting your ring at him and doing combos on him The bosses dont have fatalities but they sure are tough The storyline on this game scks and doesnt go into detail like MK did However each character has their original tournament outcome when you beat the game which is cool  Other than that this game is still da bomb Straight  simple If youre a diehard bloodthirsty MK fan then get this freakin game now Otherwise steer clearSnowboarding games are a dime a dozen these days so its nice when a good one comes along Although its rare to see a snowboarding game play out like Mario Kart it makes for a really fun game You play as one of  grade school children collect items and weapons knock off enemies with these items and weapons do tricks and get money while trying to win the race Even though the childish characters may intimidate many who see this game this still is a great game The game looks pretty nice for N standards the controls are tight the sounds are good and the music is very catchy This game also uses great ideas such as saving money to upgrade your snowboard or playing on really wacky but really enjoyable courses In fact some of the courses have no snow on them But thats the fun of this game getting to snowboard down unimaginable terrain while at the same time hitting your opponents with piepans bombs rocks and other items It releases some kind of childhood glee deep in your brain that I just cant explain But its not all fun and games though There are some problems First is the games image Many are really going to be turned off by the childish nature of this game though I liked it so much I didnt care The biggest problem is that you need a Conroller Pak to save your data The real gripes here is that there is no battery backed memory option along with the Controller Pak use and since the game requires  of the  pages in the Controller Pak youll need to spend more money getting more Controller Paks if you have other games that require it also Mystical Ninja starring Goemon Rugrats In Paris or games where you want to save data for safe keeping Wave Race  Perfect Dark But even with these issues the game is still really fun and worth playing If you like it and still want more try its sequel Snowboard Kids  But try the original first to see if you like the style of play Ill bet dollars to donuts that youll enjoy it though Great Job AtlusThis game is very nice it was hard and it took me a month to beat it  Ok I do admit some of the charecters from  and Ultimet suck so I dont pick them  Yet I cant help but love it when I do Scorpions attacks and defeat Kahn  Yet number two will always be the best I think Unless Midway goes back with the old charecters and get some real writers for a better plotawesome awesome awesome a little buggy at times but its worth it to play through trust me i bought the entire legacy of kain series off the strength of this game oh and did i say awesome already well it is moody dark and beautiful scenery buy it nowLegacy of Kain Soul Reaver  Circa 

GOOD
 Mature and Dark foreboding story based on Blood Omen Legacy of Kain with lots of twists and turns
 Voice work is really good
 Large Gothic world to explore

BAD
 Graphics looked dated to today video game players
 Raziel can really only use two weapons a staff and the sprit sword soul reaver
 Lots of old fashion block pushing
 Has a to be continued ending

IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE
 Lots of exploring lots of block moving
 An original take on the Vampire story
 Takes place in a medieval type of world similar to Dungeon and Dragons

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO
 Tomb Raider 
 Vagrant Story
 Castlevaina Symphony of the night

ADDITIONAL NOTES
 This is the first game in the Soul Reaver franchises but a spin off of the Blood Omen franchises
 Blood Omen and Soul Reaver are two different franchises that fall under the Legacy of Kain franchise
 A version of this game was also made on the PC and DreamcastLegacy of Kain Soul Reaver was one of the first games made for playstation and to this day is still one of the bestSoul Reaver follows the story of Raziel a badass vampire whos trying to get revene on his former master Kein Raziel must travel through the spectral realm and the real realm defeating  vampire tribes to get stronger and defeat Kein Wgat makes this game fun is the fact that you can go anywhere you want at anytime Also the graphics were way ahead of its time The fighting is this game is amazing you get to use Raziels brutal vampire attacks and you can use spears which can either throw for a one hit kill or beat the living crap out of your enemies The bad things about this game is that there is absolutely no sense of direction in this game I had to refer to the internet many  times to figure out where to go next Also I heard that the ending sucks I never beat the game because I couldnt get into Keins lair at the end This game has a few flaws but as long as you have a strategy guidej it can the funnest games youll ever playI LOVED THIS GAME
opening was goodgame play was good
the only thing i did not like was part of the storyline
IF you are as into the story line as i am you KNOW that raziel was never in the first blood omen BUT in this game they said he was even placed him in the room with the orignal pillar people  hehe  you will know what i am talking about  when you play
HE never had a pillar and he was never in the first one
GUUUUUR
other then that the rest of the story line was very nice
the ending made me want to cry as well
with that aside i say YAH HOOO this game rocks you need to rent it or buy it or get someone to play it for youok I have to be honest  This game totally rocked  The graphics were surprisingly impressive and the combatives that you use Such weaponry as the soul reaver Kain Reaver Ariel reaver Fire Reaver Etc is impressive and totally sucks you in  There are two reasons that I gave this game  stars instead of five stars It can be very hard due to the puzzles and lack of direction and plus it can be boring after a while because the enemies get pretty redundant after the first couple of levels  On the other hand this game is worth buying  I enjoyed exploring the  dark scary gut wrenching and yet unique world of Nosgoth and I am hoping to get Blood Omen   Either way this game is fun  Its impossible not to enjoy this gameSoul Reaver is much improved over Blood Omen the graphics being the most notable improvement  The story line is grusome yet completely involving  You can do alot of damage to your opponents and Kain is probably the most dynamic and pitiful character appearance wise to date  The dark moody atmosphere is not only necessary it is downright cool and adds a great deal to the game overall  The music score is fairly decent and controls are tight  Load times have been much improved as well
The only real problem with the game is lack of direction  It is never quite clear what you are supposed to do next so you spend alot of time wandering around waiting for something to happen  Other than that its a good game  Also replay value is fairly low because nothing really changes  All in all a good easy and fun game to kill a few hours withThis wasnt widely released in America though those who have played it swear by it as being just as fun as Mario Kart  I agree with this comparison However this has some fun twists that Mario Kart  lacks One such twist is that laps occur when you get to the bottom of the hill and jump back on the lift This can cause for some HILARIOUS chaos If two racers have a good lead on opponents but are trying to bump each other out of the way to jump on the next lift chair it can give other people a chance to catch up and possibly sneak onto a chair first if their opponents knocked each other over I love this dynamic Because it makes it more than just your average Mario Kart racing clone

Other features include the ability to buy new boards and perform aerial trick to earn extra cash Money earned during a race can also be used to buy weapon items encased in boxes littered throughout a course I also ought to mention the music its wonderful It features bubbley techno music reminiscent of dancepop groups like Aqua Youll dig the energy the music provides

If you are a fan of Mario Kart  style crossfires I think youll find this is a unique addition to your N collectionThis game is so fun and funny I got this game for my birthday a few weeks ago and i loved It so funny with the one liners from dana gould But I am warning you do not let people under the age of at least  to play because it has bad words in it My game kept saying the D word over and over and over I have a five year old brother and he heard the d word and he said over and over and over I am warning you this game is really fun and funny but dont let little kids play it or even listen to it But for sure this game is much better than Croc and CrocThe blitz series in my opinion is the most action for a sports game yet I like realistic franchise challenging games and war strategy games But this game in my opinion is the best multiplayer game for Nintendo ever
GRAPHICS
The graphics are good but not in the realistic way
How hard is the Game Play
To put it simply this game play is easy in the way you will win  every game The only way it is hard is if you are the worst team and the computer is the best team with hard playing by the computer in options
Bad mouthing
Dont get to excited because there is no swearing by players just comments from player to player that are mean after they make a tackle or make a nice catch or something
Play Editor
In blitz you can make your own plays even choosing if you want the player to fake at the time spin or even go faster But the plays arent always as successful as they seem when you make them
Players
Statistical accuracy is preety much given two ratings which are bad and awesome so stat accuracy isnt that accurate Each team only has their  best players on each team and for the rest of the positions are guards and things which play all the same So there are only really the main players on the team
Game length
The length of a normal  min a quarter game is about  minutes
Overtime
In overtime you play for two minutes and the first team to score doesnt win instead its the person who has the most points at the end of a quarter
PS Sorry this wasnt as detailed if youve read my other reviews such as season ticket madden  Ken Griffey Jr and Day traderSeason Ticket is my best one so farI rented this game with my friend and we played it the whole time he was over Well about a year after that I decided to buy it The thing I like best about the game is the Stunt level  But after having it for quite awhile it gets pretty boring The racing part against the computers is really hard sometimes I cant even get to third place If you liked San Fransico Rush youll love this gameWinaback Covert Operations was released for the Nintendo  in  and while it wasnt as popular as other games it soon had a cult following for the simple fact that its a good Metal Gear Solid clone It borrows all the elements that made the PS hit title great while putting its own spin on the terrorists threaten to blow up the world story Theres no denying where the developers of the game looked for inspiration and for the most part it pays off

You take control of JeanLuc a member of a SWATlike military group out to stop a terrorist organization from using a powerful satellite to destroy the world From there the story plays out similar to that of Metal Gear Solid except its not as complicated complete with a twist at the end You have access to a limited group of weapons that includes a pistol shotgun and assault rifle Later on youll be able to pick up a silencer rocket launcher and ammunition packs to increase the ammo you can carry You go from point A to point B in every stage  shooting soldiers hitting switches destroying laser beam sensors and acquiring keys for unlocking doors Every so often youll face off against bosses which requires you to figure out the best way to beat them To save your progress youll need to use a memory pack as this is a pretty long game Beat the game on all difficulty levels and you unlock extra modes characters for the multiplayer section and game modifiers If you have some friends you can try out the multiplayer mode with them for up to  players

The PROS For what it brings to the table its a good game While the story is not the most original its enough to get you into the game The animation is decent sound effects  music are good and the controls take some getting used but thanks to the games tutorial mode it isnt a problem that lasts long Its a long game and beating it on all the difficulty levels to unlock the extra content gives plenty of incentive While playing it on easy mode gets you used to how the game works normal and hard modes bump up the difficulty so it will give you a challenge

The CONS The graphics are decent but could have benefited from using the expansion pack Instead they are basic but because of the action you wont pay attention to it at first The camera is your worst enemy throughout the entire game Youre in total control of it which means you must turn it left or right whenever you face off against enemies and traps The camera doesnt turn on its own and if youre not careful youll walk into enemy firelaser beam traps and wont see it coming You get used to it but its a real chore The multiplayer mode is fun for quick matches but isnt as fleshed out like the multiplayer mode in Goldeneye  or Perfect Dark Also you do a lot of backtracking many times you will walk through sections already cleared so repetition sets in every so often While there are  stages altogether including boss encounters it is spread out through  areas so dont expect a lot of variety in the background

Winback was a good game and I find it is still worth taking out my console and playing it If you can overlook its flaws you may very well end up enjoying the game as much as those who tried it Its the closest thing to getting a Metal Gear Solidish game on the Nintendo  and one of the few stealth action games available for it Amazon is selling it brand new and for cheap so go ahead it wont cost you muchThis was not the best mysteryadventure game Ive ever played and Im not even a big fan of such games to begin with but I am a serious XPhile  Despite the seven CDs full of Full Motion Video than make up the game it wasnt a whole lot like being in an XFiles episode  Instead it was more like being one of those other agents who make brief appearances two or three times per season  You actually have to do some of the tedious legwork to collect evidence instead of having it conveniently handed to you after the commercial break  Of course the up side to that is a more immersive believable feel to the game and a feeling of accomplishment when you finally do spot the crucial clue
Fans of the series will find plenty of references to themes conspiracies events and trivia from various episodes as well as the familiar faces  While its not strictly necessary to recognize all the references to the series in order to solve the mystery it does add quite a bit to the game
If youre not a fan of The XFiles there are better mysteryadventure games out there  If you find mysteryadventure games frustrating you probably wont like this one even if you are a fan  On the other hand if you do enjoy both this type of game and the series its based on youll have a lot of fun with this gameThroughout the games of Midways length many of theirvideo games were straight from the arcadeswhether it was Mortal Kombat or NFL Blitz Nevertheless it was very rare to have a video game to come straight from the shelves that wasnt from the arcades That answer came through with the release of Rush 
The  video game was made exclusively for the Nintendo  and not upon any other console Ironically the prequel San Fransisco Rush was made on both the N and the Playstation The game features many exciting and enduring automobiles through the streets of some of the biggest cities in America including New York City Los Angeles and Hawaii The game also includes the infamous Alcatraz prison a hidden course from the previous Rush Many fans were shocked to know why the game wasnt on any of the other consoles at the time The sales for the Playstation version of Rush were just awful and Midway chose to put this only on Nintendo 
While many people stopped purchasing Nintendo  games Rush  remains as an absolute delight for any racer in the world If youre looking for a reved up time Rush  is that game for youRampage  is awesome Its more of the same from the orginal but moooore monsters I was up all night with this game plus theres a twistYOU HAVE TO SAVE THE MONSTERS FROM THE ORIGINAL IN ORDER TO EARN THEM Thats pretty friken awesome The  new memebers of your team are a krab dude a ryno dude and rat name Kurtus I think I dont remember there names because I played this game awhile ago
There is also another monsters thats and extra for the game I think the monsters name is Miyakis or something like that
WAY TO GO MIDWAY This was a great game
I hope they make another sequal in the future RAMPAGE  which takes place in iraq or something like that well that would be mean I guess if they do thatALL IM SAYING IS THEY SHOULD MAKE ANOTHER SEQUAL Its bin to long
The sequal to the original is better if not just as good as the original
Over all this is an awesome game for any N playerRampage  rules
LaterThis was a pretty good game but not a great game Id probably rate this closer to   stars You are agent Craig Wilmore Scully  Mulder have disappered and its your job to find them You have several locations to go to and many people to talk to in your search A couple of the features I really like was you actually have a shoot out that you control in one location and in another location you have to do a real time search to catch the bad guys towards the end Most of the cast members from the show are here Skinner The Cigarette Smoking Man  The Lone Gunmen but they werent used nearly enough There were some cool explosions and the story was pretty good but they could have made this a little harder in some aspects and a little easier like being able to get a password for your own computer Why was this so hard Overall a good game but just a few more additions and changes and this could have been a great gameI remember my friend and I playing rampage on the n he has it but then we went to rent a game and we rented rampage  so we played it and noticed that there are different monsters now and you have to unlock the original  We couldnt save the game my guess was he didnt have a memory card for his n and it was just like the first game but graphics were better and other stuff i dont remember we played this like  years ago and i was the rat and he was the rhino around level  we both got GAME OVER In the first rampage for the n there was no game over unless you quit but hey atleast this had bonus levels too later i got rampage world tour the first one and played it with my friends and i beat it like twice get the first one insteadThen go for this one because the first will get boring over timeOne of the very few Nintendo  games that I have ACTUALLY mastered Rampage  is a fun game to play First you get a choice between six  different destructive creatures to go from city to city to smash  destroy buildings vehicles and consume people You get the option of saving the game youre playing right at every five games Starts out in Denver and you go through what I would guess like about  cities in the US UK Europe Asia and Australia before hitting Area  the Moon and a couple dozen planets and asteroids Note the wolf moves the fastest while running through a city and the rhino seems to be the most ruthless Also if you hit the L button the blue button and the Z button at the same time youll see that each creature puts out their own special fifteen second source of damage Only downside of this game is it MAY be to easy for some RecommendedThis game was ok I mean SubZero is my second favorite charecter my first though is Scorpion and he is one of the resons I rented this game  It was an ok story but nothing really cool so I guess by it if your favorite charecter is SubZero other then that you will just b th about how hard it isThis would have been an absolutely brilliant game if the difficulty level had been low and if the controls had been good Otherwise its a great game The graphics are superbthe sound effects are done quite well The FMV sequences in between the stages are stunning The first stage isnt tough to beat but from thereon it becomes quite tough and frustating at times The controls arent that easy to master But all in all still a welcome addition to the MK seriesWe stopped watching the series lack of time and so this was a nice way  to keep the excitement going The game is good perhaps a little  disorienting at first I spent the first hour sitting at Craig Willmores  desk doing nothing 
Once you get the hang of it though it follows  quite nicely Because you have so much freedom in navigation you decide  where to go but things wont happen until you come back to the right place  at the right time it feels like the game is nonlinear In fact it is  rather linear although you have a few variations I wasnt disappointed in  the ending but not thrilled either it didnt blow me away We got stuck a  couple of times but we managed to make it without a walkthrough in about a  week
The rule of this game is SAVE OFTEN And organize your saves Keep  the last save before you change CDs they correspond roughly to major  developments You might need to restart from there because you forgot to  do something crucial Or because you died I got killed a lot too You  need lots of frequent saves and a few less recent and a few even less  recent not to have to restart from scratch if you believe you forgot  something at the beginning of the game But overall the storyline is quite  intuitive and youll be fine if you make connections
Buy this game if  you like the series but youre not a fanatic youd be disappointed And  youll have a good time if you can stand occasionally being stuck and turn  it into a challenge rather than into a frustrationWhile the name and look of the game feels like an original good old beat the living  outta opponents Mortal Kombat game many like myself were surprised to find that its actually an adventureplatormer styled game
This however makes Mythologies so unique The storyline is set BEFORE the first MK game so it could go in whatever direction it wishedand its all about SUBZERO
Always one of my personal favorites it was nice to see the blue clad Lin Kuei travel around on a quest full of puzzles traps and secret goodies The way they used the original motion capture method like in the first MK games also made this feel like it really WAS part of the Mortal Kombat series Plus with cameos from many of Mortal Kombats lore its fun and quite catchy to see who pops outta nowhere to be a boss or potential plot twists the first time around
One thing that makes this sort of frustrating for me is that like ALL Mortal Kombat games the game is hard even on an easy setting Also the timing is a bit off on certain areas of jumping on platforms or even attacking However this game continues to be a great game and well worth playing again and again
Definately worth the buy if you are a Mortal Kombat fan like me or if you wanna have a pretty good platformer It isnt the best out there but it sure is one awesome experience
FLAWLESS VICTORYMortal Kombat Mythologies Subzero is perhaps one of the most underrated games in the Mortal Kombat lineage The gameplay is not too far off from MK The only issue with gameplay is the turn around button Otherwise it plays just like  with platforming The story is excellent although some cinemas seem a bit campy The difficulty is a bit ramped up which is annoying but the story is worth the aggravationThis game actually scared me a couple times as I witnessed supernatural phenomena via the various monitoring devices and I wondered what was going to come find meThis is a great game to play if youve ever wanted to be  a paranormal investigatoryou get to play with some of the funnest toys  since the Ghostbusters movie  The only reason I didnt give it more stars  was because it seemed way too short  Its still a great buy howeverIt was defenitely way too short

I bought  played this game back when I was on Win use WinXPpro now and I had no problems whatsoever This game was fun exciting creepy and kept me wanting more Even after I found things I needed in places I was still curious to search more and just poke around The stories were sad and haunting but so entertaining I was VERY dissapointed that this was so short and I have been searching for a similiar game ever since with no luck at all 

Still I dont regret buying thisI mean its been forever and Im STILL searching for a game that can entertain me like this did I gave Amber  stars only because of game length other than that I say you have to play this gameI really enjoyed playing AMBER  The graphics are good the sound effects are great and the storyline dealing with paranormal research makes the most of what draws me to the adventure genre
To have the best experience with this game you really need to be patient and pay more attention to exploring your surroundings rather than just want to get through it  There were several times that I missed necessary items or possibilitites for interaction the first time through a room  But there are no really difficult puzzles so rather than run to a walkthrough if you cant find something its a good idea to just keep looking  Everything is pretty much in the open  Also there are a number of optional activities that a walkthrough might not tell you about but that it would be a shame to miss  This is one of those games where the rule is pick up everything you can and interact with everything you can  Doing so can only heighten your experience
The first half of the game is truly spooky with numerous close encounters of the ectoplasmic kind and lots of paranormal activity showing up on your equipment  One such encounter actually made my heart stop for a minute even though I was expecting it  Another that I wasnt expecting made me afraid to go back to the game for a minute  The atmosphere of weirdness is aided by the sound effects which are used subtly and with great skill  Youre always thinking youre about to stumble on something unexpected and sometimes you do  Nothing is very grotesque or frightening in and of itself but the atmosphere of suspense makes even the ordinary seem hairraising
The second half of the game is much quieter  Entering the three actual ghost worlds is almost mundane and somewhat anticlimactic  When things are spooky its more because youre experiencing the reality of a person who is himself creepy than because the actual events are scary  I found this both a disappointment and a relief after the excitement of the initial half of the game
AMBER is a slide show game in the style of MYST but I didnt miss the d presentation or  degree vision of more recent games  Navigation was generally pretty easy although there were one or two places where I had a hard time getting to where I wanted to go  One ghost world utilised a special diagonal cursor that was very hard to understand  another featured a view of the world that was pretty distorted in more ways than one  Again in these spots patience was necessary  Also the screen size is small  Setting my monitor to  X  helped some but I at least found I had to do that manually before playing  the game doesnt do it for you as most do
My main complaint with AMBER is that it was too short I finished it in under  hours  You spent a lot of time setting up and very little actually accomplishing anything  Also the few real puzzles were very easy  Sometimes I felt like I had barely begun to look at them before I accidentally solved them  The ending was also a little abrupt  I wanted more
If you like games with lots of atmosphere you will probably like AMBER  If you like lots of challenging puzzles you might not  Still at under ten bucks its a worthwhile way to spend a rainy afternoon or twoTo modern eyes this adventure is bound to look somewhat primitive but just like a good text adventure its evocative storytelling transcends technology for those who can get beyond the dated graphics and movement  model
It is a pointandclick game with a little too much  pointpointpointpointahaclick and it suffers from mild  adventureitis but there are some downright spooky moments and great  ambient noises which build and maintain an atmosphere  Here we see one of  the adventure games basic flaws inability to render sentient characters  realistically used cleverly to create a haunted feel We also  see one the adventure games primary strengths the ability to compel the  reader to piece together a story used to good advantage
A good one for  late at night with all the lights off and the headphones onTheres a ton of firstperson adventure games out there thanks to Myst but theres nothing wrong with that  What matters is if the game is enjoyable to play and in the case of Amber Id most definately say  yes
Amber Journeys Beyond is a first person adventure game with  somewhat simple graphics and animation but at the same time the plot and  story hold your interest  The premise is that you are checking up as a  favor to a friend on a woman who bought a haunted house so she could study  the paranormal  She uses a headset called the Amber device so she can  observe the ghosts and actually travel in the spirit realm  When you find  her shes in a catatonic state trapped outside of her body with no way of  geting back
Your job is to help your friend by guiding the other spirits  in the house to their final rewards by either helping them realize that  theyre dead finding an item that they lost or helping them finish  something they never completed in life  Theres three people you need to  aid before you can help your friend and no particular order in which to do  it
Although the game is only on one CD and the graphics are simplistic  Amber is still an impressive game for the value  It has enough ambiance to  make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up more than once imagine  walking into the bathroom and seeing words write themselves on the mirror  Amber can scare you but it does it in a subtle way instead of shoving a  bucketload of gore in your face  The gameplay is a bit short but still  much more than youd normally expect in a single CD game
If you want an  inexpensive yet interesting adventure this is the game for youOne of those rare cases where a game developer doesnt compromise gameplay in favour of graphics  Omega Boost gets the best of both worlds  Though the degree environment can make you dizzy the addition of the face forward button drastically improves ease of controls  And the backgrounds and characters look sharp but remain responsive which makes for a great fastpaced shooter
If anything I might have wished there would be a little more diversity in terms of weapons levels missions and some kind of a story  Imagine the customizeability of Armored Core coupled with the furious action and beautiful graphics of this game  However that didnt seem to be the intention of the designers  As an oldfashioned bloweverythingup shooter Omega Boost ranks among the best there is to offerthe only reson i got this controller becuse it was the only ones they got and I dont want to wait to go out of town to get a fist party I dont like how it feels pushing both triggers down and hard to remove the vmu other than that it fine but I worried it will brake in like  to  years time LIke my firends the had mad catz controler for play station they said it us mess up after a few weeks with the lights But hoppfuly this will last mush long senic the it has progarm abliy they had to use better parts the psx mad catz controller do not summerised in one intergated chup like the fist parties do If can get a fist party controller get it they last for very time If youre a fighting game fan and dont need an arcade stick you basically need a pad with six buttons and this is the only good choice Its easy to program and comes preset to most Capcom games anyway and the analog stick is much firmer than the Sega one also good but unfortunately anybody with small hands will HATE this Its really big and the buttons are laid out badly instead of repositioning the original  they stuck on Z and C The Dpad is very nice but the buttons dont go down easily All in all though if you absolutely must have the extra two buttons which you do for most Capcom stuff this is the best option next to an arcade stick Otherwise dont bothercontroller works no oo oo oo o o o o o  o oo  ooooo  o  ooooo o oot too shabbyI have used rd party controllers for a while now and this one by mad catz is by far the best Though it is large it has a rubberized grip as well as two turbo buttons for fighting games The range of motion on the toggle isnt as good as the original by sega but there again this is a rd party I think it feels better because of its size and the feel of the controller as well as the lower priceDoes the job Works with PS controllers too which was the main reason why I bought this Quality is sound not the bestWith all due respect to the PC version I believe the Playstation One version of Quake II is the ultimate version  Yes the Playstation version has loading times but theyre not THAT big of a deal  Theyre extremely short and hardly an inconvenience  Also the rooms were more colorful and it was easier to see what was in front of you in the Playstation version

The PC version misses out on those things but it does make up for that by having better animations from enemies and bosses  But the controls arent as good as the Playstation controller either sorry I need a controller for a video game console because thats what Ive grown up with  The PC version also has some more rooms to explore so thats nice as well

Overall either version is a good purchase but I personally like the Playstation version moreQuake  was one of my first PC games and I loved it even after all these years I still play itA little
The games plot is alright in some specksI really didnt care for the story to be honest with you but The graphics on this game were great for the year it came out
The game play was just OFF THE HOOK  The game plays like doom but BETTER  The enemy AI was good tooNot the best but good
The Best part of the game is of courseTHE GUNS  The Guns just plain Kick a
Also the game is fairl longI enjoyed itThe game is pretty oldProbably  years old now  I doubt you can find this game but if you can GET IT  This game is not the best game ever made but it will be a solid fun filled game with top notch violenceyea the games pretty violent
I havent seen many FPS like Doom Or Quake There great games
IF YOU CAN FIND IT GO OUT AND BUY THIS AWESOME GAME

Laterall in all this is a very good game  I like the variety of characters each with hisher own characteristics  Gameplay is super easy though  For the price Amazoncom is selling it for though go and buy it you will not  regret itDont let the title confuse you Mortal Kombat Gold is essentially Mortal Kombat  with a couple of subtle new features The main difference between Mortal Kombat Gold and the previous Mortal Kombat games is that its done with D polygonal graphics The gameplay remains relatively the same except now each character has their own weapon which can be drawn  The only other major difference is that Midway decided to exclude the button tap combos from this version  You have the ability to perform basic button tap combos but they are short only about  hits and have little variation between each character Most of the old Mortal Kombat favorites are back in some form or anotherLui Kang Sub Zero Scorpion Cyrax Katana ect plus several new characters as well Fatalities have also returned and as one might expect and they are as gruesome as ever presented in the rd dimension The only real fault in Mortal Kombat Gold is the same one that has plagued the series from the beginningthe shallow gameplay compared to other fighting games and the horribly bad AI in the one player mode Even with the shiny new D graphics and weapons Mortal Kombat Gold is still at its heart just Mortal Kombat   If you have become tired of the same old Mortal Kombat formula over the years you can pass up Mortal Kombat Gold and not miss much  If you still love Mortal Kombat and are looking for a new way to play and rip your opponents to shreds by all means this is your gamethis game is pretty fun  The graphics are decent the sound is also above average  This game is at its best when  human players play in a  player multiplayer game  Games are always high scoring when playing with your friends  This game is a great game if you always have people who will play with you  But when playing alone this game sucks  Sure smacking the computer is fun a while but theres no one to smack talk  The novelty of hard hits wears off fast  Also the no pass inerference rule gets cheap  On easy mode the computer gets whooped every time beacause they never pass interference but on hard the computer will use it on every play making it frustrating because it will be so freaking hard to cathc a pass  For the person with no friends this game may not be right for you  First of all this game has no season mode for  player  its just arcade mode  Secondly there are no things to keep you busy like creataplayer  i believe there is create a play but i would rather have more fun creating players   so get this game if you have lots of friends or if there are always people to play with you if you dont have friends or you are a only child stick with NFLk for all you solo gamersi love this idea every one wants to know where i got the collar necklace love it  love love love thisQuake  is completely different than the first two Quake and Doom games This game is really more Multiplayer based although Id rather play alone since most people who play it online do nothing but write filthy words and insults instead of playing But I find myself liking this game better than the new Quake  This one happens to contain several very fun mini games like Capture the Flag Team Arena Must buy expansion from store and Team Deathmatch in which youre on a team of gladiators all with the same color uniform

The story to this game is basically just that an alien named Xaero likes to watch people kill each other so he captures all sorts of gladiators from all over the universe and puts them against each other in combat The character you start with is Sarge and I suspect hes the same Sarge from Doom  You also get to use Ranger who was the character in Quake  and also the character from the original Doom whos name is Doom Basically the characters in this game comprise of soldiers aliens demons and cyborgs all of which come from the other Doom or Quake games and a few I dont recognize But I cant figure out why people keep comparing this game to Unreal Tournament Theyre two totally different games and shouldnt be compared This is a Quake game and UT isnt But all in all I found this game incredibly fun Ive spent hours just playing through it multiple timesbut still one of the best tho i wouldnt bother buying this now mainly bekause quake  is gonna kome out sooner or later and it looks awesome i still play this game konsidering how old this game is u gotta give it some kredit the graphiks tho now beat by doom and halo etc are really not bad the game maintains the klassik evil statanik kastle type maps which in my opinion bring out the fear and the kill or be killed type atmosphere and the bots this may be bekause of the way the maps are very konfined but i find the bots in this game much harder to beat kompared to the bots in the ut series and wahts more u kan sometimes seem to grasp what even sounds like a konversation with some of the bots like Crash this is very unlike singleplayer ut where u never touch the chat button try it out it kan be funny tho it usually doesnt work The weapons are simple and easy to use some sekondary fire would be interesting tho a few weapons needed in my opinion are mines maybe molotov kocktails flamethrowers and the ol nailgun i kant komment on multiplayer it doesnt seem to work on my komputer but neway i kno that ut has the best online gaming unless kounterstrike is better ive never tried that one  if u dont have this game now i suggest u download the demo its basikally all u need it has the only map i play singleplayer QDM i think however another good thing about this game is the fakt that there are so many mods modifikations tho now i would suggest people to buy ut it has the best mods quake III has kountless downloadable skins maps etc etc etc this game is a klassikYou miss you die This is basically the premise of Quake Arena iD software shows once again whos king in the fps deathmatch arena There is basically no replacement no contender for Quake Arena which sets a new standard for the deathmatch experienceStays true to the original Mass destruction over multiple different levels of tracks Its fun to play with a large group of peopleA lot of people dismiss this game because of the different developers but i personally thought it was a good game  It was the first twisted metal i have played and when i played twisted metal  i thought it was a little better but not muchIn my humble oppinion this game is better the Quake II The graphics is better and the sound is so much better If you have a Sound Blaster Live card then get this game because it was designed to run on this cardThis game is not receiving the credit it deserves Its a good quality game I had a blast playing it Far more than i did with Twisted Metal  and  The whole series is awesome and to me theres not a bad twisted metal gameNOT terrible like the other reviews say

its solid just not as good as parts  and 

but at this point in time you should be playing the newest version released look it upI played unreal when I was  and beat it in a week
The game is just plain awsome  Unfortenutly that was  years ago and I doubt this will work on XP but when Im at his house I always play this amazing game  The begining is friggin scary when youre in the abandon space ship and all you hear are the lives of the sapce crew screaming and beging for there lives
Later you soon find out that they are being torn apart by these disturbing creatures or aliens I might say  More games should be like this
The only game to be like this would probably be The suffering cause you here the voices of the COs getting torn apart by weird disturbing creatures  Maybe not the only game but there a little few games that are like UNreal
The begining parts were the best for me  The scream the horror  I think this is suppose to be a survival horror game I donno but Get this game but I think they dont make this game any more  Any ways get this and UNREAL TURNEMENT  AWSOME GAMESi didnt like this game when i first saw it at E but when i went back  and played it it turned out to be pretty good Not too many boss monsters  i hate those things some of the monsters are rather agile the weapons  are new the graphics are extremely pretty nice colors great water you  can configure all sorts of things there are some good guys to help you out  they show you hidden goodies and the game makes a lot of effort to be  stable Hey they even have a story and little logs you can read to get a  feel for the story
Its not as storyscripted as HalfLife but then it  doesnt have the awful Xen world either and many people prefer the  realistic weapons of Quake to the unusual ones of Unreal i like the  builtin bots in multiplayer i think this was the first game to ship with  them but im told the net play is really slowThere have been many N games to brighten up the new generation of gaming  This game not only has sharp graphics but it also has great gameplay and is very challengingI was never a really big fan of scifi and Star Wars just wasnt my thing I couldnt really care less about those darned rebels Obviously my expectations for Rogue Squadron that summer day were not very high

But you know what I played the first mission and I was pleasantly surprised The game actually wasnt that bad  It was actually quite entertaining just flying around and shooting these drones out from the sky The game really isnt that easy to learn especially if you buy the game used without an instruction booklet There are basically a lot of nooks and crannies that I have yet to figure out like what rightC does or how bombs work But the introductory missions are fun and pretty easy However the gameplay got to be quite repetitive I mean you just go around and shoot enemies from the sky Yay There are also a lot of sections where you have nothing to do and it gets boring Maybe I could have moved on to the third mission

I also realized how visually stunning the game is I have an Expansion Pak so I really dont have a clue what the game would be like without it but the graphics are just so crisp at least certain features The buildings and structures and ships and stuff look great almost to the level of HalfLife But the graphics for the peopleStorm troopers leave more to be desired They are obviously sprites The music does have a Star Wars feel to it and thats growing on me I sometimes get certain tunes stuck in my head and I dont mind Most of the music is in the menus though  minutes of speech is nice if only I could understand half of it Rogue Squadron has no multiplayer which is too bad It would have been fun Oh well Overall I actually kind of enjoyed this gameI used to love this game but now its dated and now that I look back on it its not as fun now either way heres my review

Graphics  This is a more realistic snowboarding game so there are very realistic colors unlike snowboarding kids or anything with very bright colors  features very realistic physics and is very sophisticated Anyways the graphics I remember loving mainly because of the powdery snow I liked to edge in deep snow just because it was it was so fluffy For that this game got what it got in this category

Sound  Whether you go through a foot of snow or right accross jagged ice theres a different noise There is a different sound for everything which is strange because really for the most part in many games on the N there is the same or a very similar song for everything in the game

Control  Very very realistic and solid but Its frustrating for that reason it is really realistic so you really have to land FLAT to get land which can be frustrating for little kids There is also damage so if you get beat up a lot you will not win the race

Fun  Nice and realistic great events and different difficulties for every age and cool characters make this a must play for any  owner of an N

This is the best Snow boarding game you can get but you will get tierd of it soonThis game definitly fits the thought I had of a snowboarding game when I set out to buy one The graphics are moderately realstic the control is ok and the sound is mediocre I think they could of done a lot better job designing a game like this but this edition suffices
  It is one of the only snowboarding games on the N which was one of the reasons i bought it Another reason is the outstanding multiplayer coordination I bought this as soon as I played it at a friends house You unfortunatley play with only  players at a time but it is still fun to play your friend head to head  There are  courses and under single player you can also do half pipe and air make There are  characters that you can use to race and more of which you can unlock since there are only  head to head course combinations there are other things you can do like trick or time attacks
  This can take a bit to get used to as it can be boring for the single player If you have a will and a friend however this game will surely be worth itIn comparison to other N games this piece is a worthwhile buy  The single player mode is challenging enough to warrant playing for a while to unlock the secret characters  Two player mode gets pretty boring pretty quickly because there are only  tracks to race on so theres not much variety  The stunt mode is the main appeal of the game and could easily occupy you for hours  However it soon just becomes a thumb spinning frenzy for points  Given this is fun for a while but it gets all that white junk inside the control stick holder and ruins thumb coordination for the rest of the day  So buy this game and spin in circles to your hearts contentRainbow Six really brought me into computer gaming Before I never played games on computers Now that Ive played and owned this I play this and Rogue Spear the sequal all the time The game really brought a new  setting to all gamers Your free in the enviroment the action is intense  and challenging the terrorists are out and dangerous Everything is  perfect Its like your there The game has great graphics and nonstop  action Its intense and you sit on the edge of your seat the whole time  The weapons in this game dont have the great collection like Rogue Spear  does but once your in the setting your weapons dont matter that much If  you like first person shooters or any swat team type of games than youll  like this Its a classic BUY ITi liked a lot some time that i havent play a wonderfull game very simply and funny game verry good gameThis Game is Awesome in every way except it only has  Mguns  Sgun and a few pistols and the storyline moves toooo quickly but the graphics and stealthy music make up for the minor loss quickly  iF You beat R and  Eagle Watch like me then get Rouge SpearI have played this game again and gain and again  it has an wit and humor about ti that makes you laugh along with wonderful charecters and a diverse and suprising story line  puzzles are moderate in hardness and the whole thing is like a movie  I felt my self saying aww in dissapointment when it was over  i wanted to keep playing  I LOVE this gameFinal Fantasy  is yet another gold brick in the shimmering castle of Squaresofts frequent triumphs You will fall in love with the characters youll wish you could jump right into the world The games events are structured very wellexcept for the everpresent level up before the final boss stage of the game The graphics are wonderful in their own right Its just as deep and enthralling as any Final Fantasy should be
But to be honest its a hassle to bother with the PC version Its best to get a playstation and play it that way FFs system requirements are strict and tend to make the game look and run worse than on the Playstation even if you have a good computer And keyboard control is no fun at allironically I used a gamepad that resembles the PS controller And otherwise this is a striaght port so youre not missing anything if you go for the PS version But if you refuse tocant buy a playstation this version is better than nothing and you certainly wont want to miss outGrim Fandango is best described as a detective story in the Film Noir tradition  The hero of the piece Manny Calavera evokes the private eye of the s or s melodrama whose story begins with a dame walking  into his office and who quickly finds himself enmeshed in a vast and  corrupt conspiracy which may do him in The difference here is that at the  beginning of this story Manny is already dead and the events transpire in  the Land of the Dead the place where according to Mexican folklore  departed souls go to embark on their journey to the hereafter
Blending  Mexican folk mythology with the Film Noir genre Grim Fandango is  ultimately respectful of both traditions and the striking art design is in  keeping with this approach combining Art Deco and preColumbian elements  The dialogue refreshingly witty and literate draws the player in to the  characters and the story as does the varied musical score which includes  Mexican folk melodies
The characters are for the most part vividly  drawn and due to the superb performances by the voice talent particularly  Tony Plana as Manny and Maria Canals as Meche are fresh despite their  mostly formula roles One character which may provoke mixed reactions is  that of Glottis Mannys driver A cartoonish Jar Jar Binkslike figure  Glottis skews the story in a younger direction at odds with the mild  epithets employed by other characters in a few instances and while my  children liked Glottis I expect most players will find him either  endearing or irritating
The interface in this game is unusual Rather  than pointing and clicking with a mouse the player controls Mannys  movements with the arrow keys waiting to see Mannys head turn to an  object he becomes interested in and clicking enter to see what  happens This approach takes some getting used to and can be cumbersome at  times but it places Manny at the center of the action and increases the  players identification with Manny ultimately serving the story
The  puzzles many of which are multistep involve crafting Rube Goldberg  solutions to various problems Some of the solutions are thoroughly  counterintuitive I wont give anything away but lets just say that  objects such as balloons or a crystal paperweight are employed in bizarre  ways and are best solved through aggressive trial and error  Clues may  pop up from time to time to expedite this sometimes tedious process That  aside the Lucasarts team especially writer Tim Schafer deserve high  praise for this highly original and literate adventureReally enjoying the game
I did freeze up once though I hope it was just a glitch and not an indication of a greater issue with this carriageA good first person shooter It really set the bar for Call of Duty and Metal of Honour Lots of levels and weapons Good challenging enemies and fun cheats I only rated it  stars because to me a  star game has to be flawless But overall a great gameThis used to be an all time favorite game of mine when I was a kid  I dont even understand how I was able to move and shoot  New gamescontrollers have made things sooo easy that this game is tough just to walkaim  With a little practice and lots of deaths you should be fineThis is when I fail in love with music and gaming but one of the toughest games yet to dateHard to believe it has been almost  years since the release of Goldeneye It makes me feel old and decrepit Those were the days of actually sitting down with your friend and playing multiplayer together Xbox Live and online has since essentially ruined those days of genuine bro bonding Now texting and Facebook has taken over anything social with letter writing and actually picking up the phone and calling someone is becoming rarer Its sad really

Thankfully we can go back to simpler times and dust off the  and play Goldeneye What was I even doing in  I was  and had not one care in the world All the main players are here doing the actual voicework and even the director of the Goldeneye film directs the gameplay The graphics are still passable but something I didnt remember is the extreme slowdown during lots of onscreen explosions or action It can take quite a bit outta the game and cause the shooting of your weapon a slight delay or lag Not a complete game changer but certainly takes a point away from an otherwise excellent game

The kills are hilarious shoot a guy in the leg he hops or he will hold his wound and croak slowly Really amazing and funny AI here certainly revolutionary as they will even attempt to hide behind cover Not sure the exact number of missions maybe around  Including the jungle snowy and runway areas Bond sports the classic PP along with other cool gadgets and weaponry you can even man a tank in a certain mission The cheats are great including a paintball mode all guns and others The juiciest part of the game is certainly the multiplayer Nothing beat grabbing a few friends and karate chopping away at each other or just use the throwing knives

Definitely a game that revolutionized console FPS shooters A definite must have for all retro gamers and Bond fanatics alikeI was hoping the game would be more complete and have the cheat codes but the cartridge was in excellent condition and the game worked flawlesslyI have to admit its not as enjoyable at least to me as Tomb Raider    This game does have much larger and more in depth worlds than the previous installments but the fact that you can choose the order in which you complete the three worlds in between the first  last something that on the surface is a pretty cool idea makes me feel like if Im having trouble in one area Im wasting my time Id have to guess the reason is I love to see the level designs for the different regions  if I can go wherever I want theres no real reward in completing anything

But I digress still building from weapons skill sets  basic traps puzzles from the previous two games with several new elements like quicksand thieving monkeys deadly piranha swarms a freezetodeath meter for the final Antarctica world alongside the breath meter  more Brings back Eidos weird dinosaur fetish they appear to have had in the s full force All three of the original Tomb Raider games have dinosaurs as well as at least one other Eidos game from the same general time called Deathtrap Dungeon It doesnt make sense because its a fantasy game but neither do the  TRexes under the Great Wall of China in Tomb Raider  And the PC version once again has bonus levels Search for Tomb Raider  The Lost Artifact if interestedNever played this when I was a kid but decided to purchase a classic game as Im trying to build my own personal PS collectionOk alot of people hate this game  but i cant complain with it Although some of the levels are annoying i hate the nd level of india with a passion at least it held mostly to the name of Tomb raider the nd and th onwards should be named City Raider the graphics are kinda yellowish the lighting can be harsh but its a lengthy game  took me almost months to beat partially cause i jumped triliogy installmentsbut its an ok game its better than the nd and way better than all the others afterwards  but doesnt messure up to the originalYes TR is a bear so to speak   Eg theres a particular spot at the very outset of the game hiding under the leaves which you have to make a blind leap to find and would never guess is there if someone hadnt told you  But that is in the grand old tradition of Adventure  the one point remainder a postage stamp usually in the old days or dropping the magazine in a particular place when youre at your wits end  The impossible puzzle drags you out of the game and forces you to kickstart your social life and ASK REAL PEOPLE for the answer  Very legitimate  Same as Dont kill monks at Barkhang Monastery TR and dont kill monkeys either TR  This game is a heckuva lot of fun on a great many levels OTHER THAN gameplay  Its full of visual splendors that rival the next to last discontinuous maze of TR and I enjoy everything about it  except playing  The game part is tedious unfair and annoying beyond belief  But its a real collectors item especially on PlayStation  be sure to keep your PS memory card and in our family its in its second generation of total immersionI own a playstation but i hardly think its that great a console Blame it on the N for their exceptional games but i do believe that the Playstation may have some hope left in it
Well Tomb Raider  is a good  example This is a huge game with a lot of D explosions and gunfire and  lots of jumping Also if you have something against people and animals  then you wont be dissappointed either
You also get to blow uo raptors  and a Trex by the way Despite being a solid title i beta the game long  ago and have since went on to other pursuits like Zelda Im not gonna  compare the two mind you but lets say that while TL is a really good  game and somewhat long its not gonna make a classic or give Mario or  Sonic a run for their money
Simply put all the TR games are long and  filled with adventure Laras cute and i like this game but its just not  gonna be what im looking for longterm
Its also tedious to have to  play through it again I think its a moodgame youre likely to bore  through the WHOLE thing when youre in the mood and that sounds  extreme
But as you can tell  stars is saying alot cause this game  definetely restores my faith in the playstation and its overrated games
If Lara were to make the jump to the Dolphin i wouldnt be surprised  Tomb Raider always had the potential to be a great game its just that  sometimes you need a lot of patience and perhaps this will fit  nicely
Finally the graphics and the sound are passable Levels are  detailed but heavily pixelated and sound sounds cranky or too soft at  times
But given any new Lara Croft game ill be excited and im looking  foward to the new game after the last one last ChristmasThe game is overrated Dont get sucked into all the hype Its more nostalgic for the people who played it when it first came out The graphics are honestly really bad and the controls make you feel like youre drunk I guess thats where the fun is though because honestly I really did like the game I played through it and although the gameplay schematics were a bitstrange it was oddly addicting Multiplayer is a lot of fun though when you have friends sitting down in the basement all hooked up It can get pretty intense on split screen seriously  stars for the split screen  stars overall because the gameplay was repetitive and the graphics were vomit They could have been better for the time period and the N was capable of handling better than this Still worth the buy Get itOverall I cant complain but the cartridge was a little dingy Still nothing a magic eraser couldnt fix By chance alone I received an uncommon copy only sold for retail demonstrationwas a good purchase dont get me wrong but i had a minor problem with it saving at first it wouldnt save for the first  or  times but eventually it did other than that it worked great awesome condition came as describedI came upon this game in the late searly s Me and a couple of friends would play it religiously and I must say that although the characters are better and more original in this game Perfect Dark if you havent had a chance to play that is the superior shooter

They both are fun in their own right though They were both made by Rare which did WONDERS for the N gracing us with the aforementioned games and also Diddy Kong Racing which I played for hours on end with friends also

Fun levels to play in and the music was pretty damn good too Like I said I liked the characters Natalia being my absolute favorite and I kept coming back to this game

Even the singleplayer mode was fun Just not nearly as fun as the multiplayer mode

Overall BThe only down side is that these guides are not from Nintendo so theres very little original art work and a lot of information How ever the hardcover and golden side shets make it an elegant productthis ganme was very entertaining i really enjoyed it im not to fond of these types of games but goldeneye was awesomeThis game was okay  it couldve been better  I like the story its way different than it is in the movie  its more fun  But like I said before Perfect Dark  is the new Bond  The main story is fun and so is the multiplayer combat  Theres a crap load of Bond characters to unlock and levels too  But Im not a Bond fan in fact I hate Bond  But this game is funI highly recommend this game as a GREAT classic It will feel dated and look terribly pixelated on your  screen but it is a game worth playing Pull it out for a day of Reminiscent Gaming or as a chance to dive deeper  into the universe that is ZeldaClassic game A favorite when I was a kid Still fun to this day I just wish the graphics were better Got to remember this game is from  and one of the first D games of its time Great gameBanjo Kazooie is a game Ive played many times since I got it in the early s and while its fun its not the most entertaining game Ive played Theres two main objectives in Banjo Kazooie hunting and gathering You hunt for these jigsaw pieces called Jiggys to help you complete jigsaw puzzles to open worlds You gather all sorts of items within each level like musical notes Jinjos Mumbo tokens feathers etc This concept gets boring after awhile but nevertheless the game is pretty fun as a whole Id recommend the sequel Banjo Tooie instead as its  times more entertainingI had to use a Gameshark to get the extra levels on this game  Its tough  It shows you just how hard it would be to be a secret agent

There are two features about this game that I really like  The first is what Id like to call maimability  If you shoot someone in the leg theyll hold onto their leg same with the arm the head and even the groin  Before this game the most you could hope for was that characters would bleed when they were shot and fall down when theyd die

Still maimability doesnt mean that when you shoot them in the leg they wont be able to run again  Theyll limp for a few seconds and then be as good as new except take a lot less shots to kill

Some of the tougher characters take a lot of hits before theyre even to the point of getting to maimability  You have to shoot the boss of the game  times in the head before he even shows signs of weakening

The second thing I like about this game is the spy feel of it  You go on missions and you work with gadgets although some are indeed lame  But the cool thing is on some missions youve got to be really quiet and sneaky  You sneak down halls and pick off unsuspecting guards one by one with wellaimed shots  Of course if you get bored of that you can always make a lot of noise have a bunch of guards come after you and blow everyone away

This game is pretty realistic  There may be better games now but during its time this game was cuttingedge stuff  Its worth remembering even though it was hard as heck  I usually just like playing the easy levels and maiming bad guys quietlyDeveloper Rare is a master at infusing originality into their imitations This isnt a knock against them William Shakespeare pulled stories and plots from other writers and crafted masterpieces Rare is gamedoms Shakespeare in that regard BanjoKazooie is obviously influenced by Super Mario  although its always unfortunate for a game to be compared to that masterpiece While BanjoKazooie lacks Super Mario s magic and ingenuity it has its own magic that sets it apart from Nintendos behemoth

The Good
 A fun story
 An imaginative use of its characters
 Creative worlds to explore

The Bad
 Too easy and short
 The few parts that are too hard

The Ugly
 Why is Kazooie so insulting

Story

The first thing that stands out is the dialogue especially of the evil witch Gruntilda or Grunty who speaks in clever rhymes Its refreshing all the more that what she says is often funny The game begins with her asking her mirror Who is the most beautiful of them all Of course it couldnt be Gruntilda Theres nothing even remotely pretty about a fat green hag The most beautiful of them all is Banjos younger sister Tooty who looks similar to Tiny Kong of Donkey Kong fame So Grunty sets off to kidnap Tooty and succeeds leaving only the mole Bottles as a witness Bottles must survive a downpour of Kazooies insults and witticisms to explain the kidnapping to Banjo and Kazooie The question becomes can Banjo and Kazooie save Tooty before Grunty robs her of her beauty and transfers it to herself

Gameplay

Here is the games bane and boon Everything else sets it up wonderfully The soundtrack is great the visuals are very nice and the opening story sequence is funny The game controls smoothly and you have plenty of moves to learn and use throughout The levels are varied with plenty of collectibles and other goodies to discover But these levels are so small so short so easy I never spent an hour and a half on any one level and most of them took less than an hour to complete In that time I could collect ten jigsaw puzzle pieces one hundred musical notes and numerous other items such as the Mumbo Jumbo skulls extra lives and Jinjos Compared to Super Mario  I cant help but say is that all

There are a total of nine worlds as well as a main hub world which is too labyrinthine for its purpose Rare goes a little overboard as to the amount of collectibles they expect gamers to gather Unless you use cheats it takes  out of the  Jigsaw pieces total to unlock every single world including the final fight with Grunty Thats not too difficult as Id say about  of those Jigsaw pieces are a piece of cake More than  of the  music notes are needed in order to give you somewhat of a chance against the unfairly difficult fight with Grunty you just cant count on Rare to make a strictly childrens game see Diddy Kong Racing

These are mostly criticisms but they comprise a small percent of the game You will spend most of it enjoyably Despite the very easy difficulty it isnt boring Theres plenty to explore in the levels and as they go on they become larger and more complex especially the sprawling final level Rare flexes all of its creative muscles in that level revolving around the four seasons and even includes a few semistories with some new characters Not that the other levels are clunkers but if only they could provide the same sort of entertainment the rest of the game would have been that much more enjoyable

Longevity

A game should only be as long as it needs to be but I think BanjoKazooie needed to be a little longer Considering what Nintendo did years earlier in Super Mario  its no excuse that Rare couldnt match that level of magnitude But its unfair to compare any game to Super Mario  Most gamers will complete this all  Jigsaw pieces almost all  music notes in less than twelve hours After finishing it theres no reason to go back The cheats only give you infinite resources but whats the point when youve already finished the game The only way a game like this can extend its life is for the single player adventure to be a little longerIn recent memory strategy guides have become less of a necessity and more of a collectors item  For every game nowadays there is a guide to accompany it  Sometimes theres a collectors edition guide as well  For collectors these are sometimes a lot of fun  For Zelda fans that enjoy Zelda lore this collection is a fantastic buy  There is a limited number in print and its simply amazing to behold  Its great packaging and actually has things in there specifically for collectors

Before I begin I want to stress that this review wont be going into the content of each guide  With the exception of the Skyward Sword guide each of these guides is exactly the same as their standard and separately released collectors edition counterpart  The reason Skyward Sword is not the same is because this copy was revised and expanded upon  Aside from that the other five guides are largely unchanged from their original releases  There are subtle differences but nothing that greatly changes the actual content in the guide

To begin the guides come packaged in a box that looks like a chest  When you open it up there are six hardbound guides in there  The covers all look very similar  Each one having an embossed Hyrule symbol on them  The covers and the borders are different on each guide  The six guides included are for Twilight Princess Phantom Hourglass Spirit Tracks Ocarina of Time D Skyward Sword and the Windwaker HD  All the guides have gold leaf pages that are shiny when looking at them from the side

There are a couple of things to note about the guides themselves  The first is that it seems just a little strange that the guides themselves are not actually individually shrink wrapped  This seems a little odd  Its not that big of a deal but when you open the packaging theyre already loose  Considering each original release came shrink wrapped its a little strange  Perhaps the thing that some consumers might mind is that none of these guides come with their respective extras  Anything that was considered a bonus for getting the collectors edition guide isnt here  Likewise when this particular collection was announced The Legend of Zelda A Link Between Worlds simply wasnt planned for the package  So anyone hoping this guide comes with the collection are out of luck  Thats no big deal

There are also a couple of things to note here about only a couple of guides  The first and most obvious is the Ocarina of Time D guide  Prima NEVER actually released a hardcover edition of this guide  Ever  This is the first time that Ocarina of Time D players will get to grab this guide in hardcover  Originally the guide was only in paperback  This makes the collectors value certainly worthwhile as it means that the guide will have much more limited hardcover run than all the other guides here  This boxset is more or less your only chance to get it

The second thing of note is that the Skyward Sword guide included here is NOT the same as the one originally published  It has been revised and expanded  Even the layout is very different from the original guide itself  It has been revised and expanded by over  pages  It is almost a completely new guide from the original one that was released  So yes this one too is a rarity because you wont have much luck finding it outside of this particular box set

There are a couple of subtle differences between some guides and the originals  Most notably is the Ocarina of Time D guide  The original guide was around  pages and written in three columns  Here its  pages and is written in two columns  Its a lot easier to read and a lot cleaner as a result  Much of the text isnt so cramped  Some moments in the Ocarina of Time D guide pop out a lot easier  It just looks better and more organized overall  The Legendary Checklist in the Ocarina of Time Guide is also better looking  The tables are easier to read and easier on the eyes  Likewise the Legendary Checklist in the Twilight Princess Guide is A LOT easier to read and A LOT less cramped  In the original guide the entire checklist was on a single page with just the location  Here its expanded to be in a table format the font is bigger and it now lets you know your first chance to complete it as well as telling you whats required  The Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks guides are virtually unchanged from their initial releases  The Windwaker HD is pretty much the same as well  So for those wondering about whether or not theyve changed some things from the original guides the answer is yes  Quite simply put some of them are a tad easier to read

The set also came with a few bonuses of note  The first and probably most valuable of all is that you get a certificate of authentication from Eijo Aonuma that is signed and numbered  The second is a laser etched metallic bookmark  For collectors this package is a pretty sweet deal  Its invaluable  The only thing I wish we couldve gotten would have been to actually get all the extras the guides themselves actually came with  It is more or less the only thing I feel is missing and keeping it from being a complete package  Part of what made the guides collectors editions aside from the hardcovers was actually getting little bonuses that didnt come with the guide otherwise

Nevertheless for the fan of Zelda this is a good buy  But lets be clear  If you are buying this chances are it is probably not to actually utilize the guides themselves  After all many of the games these guides are for have been out for a while and truthfully you could just buy them on their own if you really wanted them for strategy  They are a collectors item  And it is certainly a nice oneThis was the first CC game I ever purchased I got this game when I wasnt playing much else apart from EVERQUEST upon a friends recommendation I wasnt to familiar with the CC franchise of RTS games from Westwood Now I am a fan of the series
If you dont know TIBERIAN SUN is a RTS about two military forces at odds with one another The evil NOD that wants to rule the world while the honorable GDI wants to protect the world The single player missions are on two discs One is GDI and the other disc is the NOD single player missions Both are quite fun and it helps you to learn the gameplay I cant say I liked the fullmotionvideo sequences but they are quite funny in an unintentional way
The online multiplayer is where the real fun of TIBERIAN SUN is at There just is no way to describe winning a long  hour match online and not getting booted off
This is a good value for the money It may not be as great as AGE OF EMPIRES or STARCRAFT but TIBERIAN SUN is fun nonetheless EnjoyWhen I first got the game it was Wow thinking it would be the best  I have to admit it is better than some games I have already played but it just didnt have the zing of the other CC games
The computer stinks  I could beat them playing as GDIgood guys which is hard because NODbad guys has all the best vehicles units and structures  I love the Missile Silo  Talk about blitzcrieg on your opponent  If you want to have about a  chance of winning stick with NOD
I wouldnt recommend the missions because they are all too easy or all too hard  I stick to skirmish and internet games myself
I might venture to say that it is worth an inexpencive look  Maybe even borrowing it from a friend
Allinall I would have to say that the graphics are superb stories are bad  sound is soso and gameplay is dependant on which side you chooseNOD being betterOkay I admit it the two main reasons I bought this game are James Earl  Jones and Michael Biehn whom I believe are bloody great However the game  in itself is lots of fun Im making my way through the GDI games at the  moment and having a good timeI have been looking forward to receiving this set since I learned about and preordered it back in August I am a huge Zelda fan and always wanted to get my hands on the strategy guides but never seemed to get around to buying them when they first released and over time they became very expensive This works out great because we can get all of the Collectors Edition guides plus one never released and only available in this set Ocarina of Time for a great price  each guide ends up being less than  each not including the packaging

As other have said the packaging is wonderful The treasure chest box is better quality than I had anticipated and the gold metal etched bookmark is gorgeous The actual shipping packaging was great as well  very well protected with lots of foam so it arrived in pristine shape

The guides themselves are gorgeous Great detail and amazing artwork I also love how the paper edges are golden  it gives it a very classy look I have yet to actually read through them let alone use them so I cant say how accurate and useful they are but I am sure the do their job and then some I was very concerned about the Skyward Sword guide because the reviews for the original version were absolutely terrible Fortunately however I read that it has been updated to meet the quality of all of the other guides so that was a huge sigh of relief

I do have a few gripes for this set though They are quite minor in the grand scheme of things so it didnt kill it for me too much  they are just things I wish they would have included

First I am very disappointed that no guides were made for the older Zelda games ie Zelda I and II for NES Link to the Past for SNES LInks Awakening for Gameboy etc I wouldnt even mind if they threw several games into one or two books to make it more efficient  it would just have been nice to have guides for every Zelda game in one set

Second I was disappointed they didnt leave an empty slot for A Link Between Worlds Theyve had this planned for a while and have had to have known the game was coming out the same time as this as well as the collectors edition guide Not a huge deal but again would have been a nice consideration

Third and this is just something I would have thought to be cool  not dinging this set at all for not doing it it would have been INCREDIBLE if they had some sort of audio device inside that makes the chest opening music from say Ocarina of Time when you open it  similar to when you open a greeting card with prerecorded messages Perhaps someday I will figure out how to do it myself  until then I will have to just sing the tune myself 

Finally I am sad that some of the bonus content that came with the guides when they were originally released werent included I will be honest I dont know which guides came with what but I have seen others complain about this stating that Twilight Princess in particular came with a few goodies

Overall I am very happy with this set For Zelda fans it is a must buy especially if you dont own many or any of these guides already Thanks for readingI have always liked this game overall and it will always have a special place in my heart With that said the rubberbanding AI in this game is beyond ridiculous No lead is safe as the game cheats to catch up to you by increasing the speed of its controlled drivers to higher than they can possibly go I dont know if later Mario Kart games ditched the rubberbanding AI but its presence is strong in this oneThis pretty good it has a good story great ingame movies and adequate gameplay However most of the marketing for this game has centered around it being a sequel to Red Alert This is simply not true The two games have  almost nothing in common and Red Alert is a far better game In saying this  I mean that Tiberian Sun takes a huge step BACKWARDS in terms of gameplay  from Red Alert Gone are the ships and air planes to be replaced by boring  helicopters and cheap hover units
  However this game is  not a total waste it has a very good storyline and execellent cinematics  featuring performances by several Hollywood stars well maybe not stars but  close enough The graphics are pretty good but other games have done  better
  Sure its a classic and if you really like the series go  ahead and buy it But if you want the true best strategy game of  go  and check out Homeworld its a far better gameI have to admit something I love the way this game looks  It is spectacular in the graphics sense but the story just left me out to dry  The orginal command and conquer storyline was way better  The GDI missions  are a joke in this game and I have to say itNOD RULEZ  The NOD missions  are very fun to look at and play especially the evil HAL computer that  talks to you in the cool voice  The game play units are completely  unbalanced  On GDI side all you have to do is amass a huge army of Tank  Mechs and you can destroy any base no matter how fortified it is  On the  NOD side amass a huge army of  mobile artillery and nobody can stand in  your way  The game is worth buying to see how it looks but the gameplay  is horrible and some of the missions are close to impossible which may  frustrate some novice players  Ok Westwood you have provided the  interface now quit slacking and give us a good storySticker label is quite faded but i guess ok for acceptable condition  other than that cartridge is clean works great shipped fast  Highly satisfiedit was fun finding the differences in the pictures but it got boring when the same pictures kept comming up it would have been better NOT to have a time limit on these games  that just makes it harder and frustrating for beginners like me  i am handicapped and disabled and dont move that fast  also i just turned  so im not that fast mentally either  there should be an option to choose if you want it to be timed or not  there should be that option on ALL gamesIve had this game since way back when it was released I just never got the chance to write a review

The Story Banjos sister Tooty was the most beautiful girl around and Grunty the witch wanted her beauty so she pulled an Amber Alert and took her to her lair Banjos lazy bum the whole time was sleeping Its up to you to get jiggys and notes and whatnot to stop Grunty and get Banjos sister back

Graphics  Awesomely different and creative worlds From a sewer to a pirate ship on an island to a desert and into an icy snowland there are tons of different and unique worlds to play through The graphics are stellar for the N with bright colors and cool characters with good animations This is one of the best N games as far as graphics go next to games like Donkey Kong  and Legend Of Zelda Majoras Mask

Sound  There arent really any voices in this game just kind of sound effects that are different for each character Blubber on Treasure Grove Cove sounds like hes burping or throwing up Kazooie sounds like a gagging bird Banjo sounds like a big old hick of a bear and so on The music in this game though is some of the catchiest and the best music ive heard in really any adventure game The music doesnt really get old and whoever created it is brilliant Overall the sound is really really good

Control  Being an adventure game there are a lot of different controls for a lot of different moves And since the N controller is the way it is  pretty annoying  its easy to get confused even after playing for hours on end just because you go brain dead The controls are a bit strange at first to do some of the attacks but you will get used to them anyways

Fun  A great game from beginning to end Get the jiggys move on Get the notes move on That simple No This game is challenging and is for all ages even if it does have a kiddy approach The game lasts maybe  hours or so depending on how fast you get through the game Great characters great level design and fantastic music makes this a must buy This is one of the best games on the N and IMO the best adventure game Pick this game up now it is better than its sequel and the Game Boy Advanced ones even if all three are fantastic Buy this game

If you own a N and are looking for a game to play go to your local game store and find BanjoKazooie In my opinion this game is simply amazing The main plot throughout the game is that Banjo the bear and his faithful breegull sidekick Kazooie are attempting to rescue Banjos little sister Tootie from the evil witch Gruntilda Enjoy the game as you explore  exciting worlds collect numerous puzzle piecesopen worlds and rescue your sister from the evil clutches of Gruntilda
