I had seen this game sitting on the shelves of software stores for months.  When the price finally lowered I decided to buy it.  It was well worth my money.  The game is absolutely stunning.
The first thing to note is the graphics.  The textures aren't really that detailed, but that doesn't stop them from preforming.  The scenery is absolutely beautiful.  Playing the game makes me want to visit Rennes le Chateau for real.
The next good thing is the soundtrack.  It is perfect.  Every scene has a unique track.  Sometimes I have the character just stand around doing nothing so I can enjoy the music.
Lastly the story is fabulous.  It has some great supernatural influence, as well as classic detective work.
I take away one star because some of the puzzles can be ridiculously difficult expecially if you don't understand what you're supposed to be doing, but don't let that stop you.  If you really need to you can always find a walkthru.
