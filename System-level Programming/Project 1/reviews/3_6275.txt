I bought this together with Final Fantasy VII, and when I played VIII, I was somewhat displeased with it.
  Let me start by saying that the graphics for this game are the BEST you'll find out there for the Playstation game console; the cutscenes almost seem real.
  Now, the disadvantages:  Tutorials make the game extremely boring.  Towards the beginning of the game, some lady teaches you something about "junctions" for a half an hour, and I couldn't remember any of it afterwards.  There is also no plot.  You seemingly walk around different towns and fight random bosses that have nothing to do whatsoever with the actual story, if there was any.
  So, I recommend that you try other Final Fantasy games first, like IX and VII (those are excellent ones).  If you can't help yourself, rent this one and see if you like it or not.
