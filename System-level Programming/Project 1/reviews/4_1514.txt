I enjoyed this game.  It was very fun.  It was the very first game I owned for the N64, so I didn't really understand how the controls worked but this game was really easy to figure out.  I love it.  When I walk by it in stores and see it ..., I'm speechless.  It is a great game, and by the looks of it, the price it down too.  This is definently worth your money.
