This is one of the best shoot 'em ups on the 64. This game is pretty much the same as the PC version, but with more levels, extended levels / or added bits and peices, and a few new toys.

It pretty much feels just like the PC version but it's a little darker on the graphics. You will have to run trough the game control settings to find the right feel for you if you're like me and where used to using the keyboard.

Most of the cool stuff is still there from the PC game. There is the same sayings, some new ones, same levels etc.. whats missing is the adult content the PC had packed into it. So some things are different like, there is no strippers dancing around, and you can't go up and press OPEN to throw them money, and the posters are different etc... infact the second levels strip club has been completly re decorated into an out-door loading dock with trucks. Thats a bit of a disapointment that that stuff was replaced to tone it down.

There is some new toys to play with, but overall, there isn't enough weaopens. There is a hand gun, shot gun, machine gun, plasma shooter, grenade thrower, shrinkin ray, enlarging ray (new weopen! enlrage you're enemy till the explode!) and a few other ones. But compared to something like Goldeneye, there feels like harldy any guns to choose from.

I used to love to use cheats on the PC version, and with this 64 version, there are a couple of cheats, but there's none to walk through walls which I do miss.

(...)it's pretty hard to stay alive, so turn the god mode on and enjoy it.
