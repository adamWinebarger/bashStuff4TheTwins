As a child, many of us have had ant farms, well, did you ever wonder what it would be like to be in one?  Here's your chance.  This game is cheap and simple to learn.  Pros:
--It has a simple to learn interface and  everything is self-explanatory
--Controlling your growing ant empire is a  cinch, click there, the ant goes there, push that, yougo to the  corresponding screen.  Everything flows.
--It has very few system  requirements.  A Mac Classic with a CD drive could practically run  it!
It's cheap!
Cons: --It is too simple, all you need do is sit and  wait.  the computer who controls your empire in all the different sections  of the yard will slowly oust the bad ants until you win.
--Has little  replay value.  Once you win it, all the other games are the  same.
Overall, I would reccommend this game, just for the fun of it.  But  if you want a game to get addicted to, one that you can play over and over  again with a challenge, you should consider looking somewhere else.
