While the name and look of the game feels like an original good old "beat the living #$%* outta opponents" Mortal Kombat game, many like myself were surprised to find that its actually an adventure/platormer styled game!
This however makes Mythologies so unique. The storyline is set BEFORE the first MK game, so it could go in whatever direction it wished...and its all about SUB-ZERO.
Always one of my personal favorites, it was nice to see the blue clad Lin Kuei travel around on a quest full of puzzles, traps, and secret goodies. The way they used the original "motion capture" method like in the first MK games also made this feel like it really WAS part of the Mortal Kombat series. Plus, with cameos from many of Mortal Kombats' lore, its fun and quite catchy to see who pops outta nowhere to be a boss or potential plot twists the first time around.
One thing that makes this sort of frustrating for me is that like ALL Mortal Kombat games, the game is hard even on an easy setting. Also, the timing is a bit off on certain areas of jumping on platforms or even attacking. However, this game continues to be a great game and well worth playing again and again.
Definately worth the buy if you are a Mortal Kombat fan like me, or if you wanna have a pretty good platformer. It isn't the best out there, but it sure is one awesome experience.
FLAWLESS VICTORY!!
