This game is so boring, I never finished it. For one, you can't die, you just resurrect, so why even care if you get killed. Also, you can get lost and never finish a mission and not care because even if you do, nothing happens. You don't build up armor or weapons and who cares any ways because, oh right, you can't die. You also can't build up a hunting party and people you meet have no real purpose because you can go anywhere. I never figured out the importance of any of the story line.
