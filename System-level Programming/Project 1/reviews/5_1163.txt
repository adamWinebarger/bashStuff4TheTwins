I was actually thinking about this game a few months ago and it was killing me that I couldn't remember the name.  This game was a ton of fun though I'm sure if I played it now I would laugh at how dated it is.  If you have a way to play this I recommend it.  I blew a lot of hours on this game and would gladly pick it up again if they made it available for download on the PS3.
