Honestly, let's face it.  RE2 was one of the best in the series and is always a serious must have.  We're in the age of PS3's now and I understand that since it is 2012 that the graphics may not seem as good as they were when RE2 1st came out, but the gameplay is still awesome!  Also, the voiceacting is at least a step up from RE1!
