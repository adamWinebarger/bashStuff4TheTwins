Rather like 'Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear', 'Delta Force 2' initially seems to be a slightly-massaged mission pack for the original 'Delta Force'. The graphics have been improved slightly, in that you now get to crawl through  grass, and considerably more of the man-made scenery can be blown sky-high  with a wider range of macho hardware, the but the actual gameplay boils  down to long-range sniping, followed by close-range sniping, followed by  grenades and a dash to the rescue chopper. Unfortunately for 'DF2', it  isn't enough. Crucially, the voxel-based graphics engine, whilst perfect  for long-range sniper-fests, is jerky and slow on anything less than a fast  PIII. Whilst not unattractive, the graphics seem shoddily done, with  buildings looking particularly nasty. It's a shame, really, as voxels seem  to be the only way to display convincingly-detailed topography without  curtailing the viewing range. The gameplay itself is hardly changed from  the original, and becomes quiet monotonous after a while - the variety  present in 'Rogue Spear' is missing here. All the original AI faults are  back, too - the bad guys have a habit of dashing straight past you when  they get up close, or running into walls and sticking there.
All in all,  it's much the same as the original, and if you liked that, you'll like this  - but only if you have a fast PC. It's important to stress this. On my  450mhz P2, the game juddered in 640x480 resolution, making it very hard to  accurately aim, fire, and shift my aim to another target.
