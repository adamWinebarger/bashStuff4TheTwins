Sonic Adventure is a pretty good game.  I came into this one expecting a game like the old Sonic games.  It is nothing like that.  It really is a full-blown adventure!  Personally, I was looking forward to more side scrolling action.  Navigating the 3-D can get a bit tedious at times.  If you have no problems with that, then this game is for you!
