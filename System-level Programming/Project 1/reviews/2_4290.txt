I guess you could say that this game was pretty much a dissappointment. I probably would have liked it more if I hadn't already bought Rollercoaster Tycoon (even though I'm not really a fan of that game, it's a LOT better than Sim Theme Park). I felt ripped off when I found out that there were only four theme parks to choose from, which made this a very short lasting game. Another major problem is - you can even build your own rides! Talk about cheap.
Overall I give Sim Theme Park 2 stars, I gave the extra star because I probably would have liked it more if I got it before I got Rollercoaster Tycoon. Actually, this game is pretty good for all ages, it's just leaning a little more towards the younger kids, about I guess 6-12. If you want a game for older gamers, try Rollercoaster Tycoon. (I suggest that you just ditch the thought of buying a game about building amusement parks and get a game like The Sims or somehting).
