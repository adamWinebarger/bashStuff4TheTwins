When I first saw Super Mario 64 in 1996 I had to pick my jaw up off the ground.  While 10 years have passed, I still consider this game of the finest pieces of entertainment I have ever seen.  The kinds of things that the development team pulled off in the mid 90s set the stage for all future video game development and it was, is and always will be groundbreaking.

An achievement that should not be ignored and is still as much fun today as it was a decade (DECADE?!!?) ago.

***** HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION
