Not that many golf games in the video game industry can actually sell very, very well. Most of them use a major player's name, and suppose to have their "skills" in the process. Not that many of them can have a strong sense of enjoyment in the golf world, where everyone wants a more serious side in the sports world with football, and basketball. However, Nintendo seemed to hit the nail on the head with their 2000 creation.
With Mario Golf, the game consists of the start of four golfers, including Baby Mario, Peach, and a couple of others. Throughout the game, you can access the Get Character mode, which can help you challenge other characters like Mario, Bowser, and Yoshi. Once you win the character, you also need them, the harder the challenger in the round. It is also important in the Tournament mode, where you can also earn enough points toward newer golf courses and challenging holes in the process. Each course reflecting on the cute, Mario Brothers themed style, which makes it appealing to all ages old and young, where the other games don't seem to have that sense of enjoyment.
Although Nintendo stopped making games for the Nintendo 64, Mario Golf is only one of the very few sports games I highly recommend for the system. Although many people might not see the review, because of the newer game system reviews and newer games of the Gamecube, Xbox, and Playstation 2.
