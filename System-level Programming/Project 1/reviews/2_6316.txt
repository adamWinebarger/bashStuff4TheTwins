I got this game last year and I have only just completed it. In a technical sense, this is indeed better than the other TR games. But I do feel that it is a victim of it's own realisticness. It starts off brilliant and great to play. Especialy the moving train effect. But once you get to the 'City of the Dead' things go downhill. I mean it gets so dark that even with the monitor on full brightness and the house lights out, you still have to lightflares to see whats what. There are also not enough flares to get around with either. Sure this would be the situation in real life, but in real life you have the advantage of 3D vision to guide you. Not in a game.  Not only that, but the levels get boring towards the end aswell. It seems stupid that game programmers would spend out on high-tech graphics and creative innovations and then blanket them with an over abundance of darkness.  Apart from that though. The sound is brilliant. The movies realy fit in well. Lara looks better and (if you can see them) the graphics are great too.
