Super Mario Land is unlike any other brand of Mario that I've ever played. Jumping right in to the first level, nothing is characteristic of a typical Mario; alien spacecrafts, exploding koopas, and airplanes abound. When the game came out in 1989, it was a testament of technology on the small screen. Those sentiments don't hold up as much today. Poor controls and awkward level design plague the game. The game is moderately difficult, but not anything an experienced player should have any problem overcoming. The game can be beat in an hour or less and makes the perfect time waster if you want to play a game, but your schedule doesn't allow you to do so for a prolonged period of time. Because of the lack of playing time, there is no save feature. The game does have some replay-ability, as once you beat it, the next play-through will include different enemy placement and a little more of a challenge (unless of course you shut it off or your batteries run out...d'oh!). The background music, while simple, is one of the more memorable factors of the game. I recommend picking it up, especially for the price on this site. However, don't expect a "timeless classic" like other reviewers have praised it to be.
