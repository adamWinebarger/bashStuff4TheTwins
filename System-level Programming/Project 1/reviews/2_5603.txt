It's technically competent, and indeed 'competent' is a good word. It's  just very, very uninspiring, and after a seemingly endless and tortuous  wait (the release was held back for three years, during which time many of  the creators left the company), it's a disappointment. Not a huge one, as  people were beginning to suspect that it might not be very good. Whilst  'Half-Life' had the advantage of suddenly appearing from nowhere,  Daikatana's gestation was extremely public, despite the 'it'll be ready  when it's ready' attitude. What's it like, though? Dull. That's what.  Whilst by no means as lacklustre as 'Blood 2', it's infected with an air of  carelessness. The graphics and sound are functional, the gameplay is no  more advanced or entertaining than 'Quake 2', the character AI and voice  acting are both simplistic and irritating (your sidekicks are infuriatingly  stupid, and their death instantly loses you the game) and, crucially, both  'Half-Life' and 'Soldier of Fortune' are much, much better, and cheaper.
