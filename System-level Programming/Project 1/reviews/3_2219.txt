I see a lot of negitive reviews here. You have to remember this is an old game now, but more importantly a game that started a long line of arcade racers. This game was released in arcades in 94 and two years later it finally made it home. But unfortantly they took a bit out of the arcade game to make it "E". This game just came to late. It was still a fun game, but only for a little bit and the sound was down played too. But in 96 it was still really well liked, but just didn't age well. But for anyone who thinks this is terrible you have to understand its older then the 96 release date.
