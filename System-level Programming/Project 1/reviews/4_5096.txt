Baldurs Gate, is probably one of the better role playing games on the market today. It has some good characters, along with a riviting story line that will keep you hooked as you play it. The music is great, and the graphics are very good for a computer game. There is a wide list of characters and NPC's that will help your character on their quest. And the best part of this game, is that the controls are actually easy to use, so you aren't stressing yourself out to looking for the right buttons to use in your battles. I rate this game at 4 stars because it could be a little longer, and a little better, but for 19.99 it is definately a game worth buying.
