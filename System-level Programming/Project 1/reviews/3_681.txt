I use to play this AGES ago and use to be pretty good. I started playing it again and I now found that the controls (at least for me) don't seem very forgiving. In order to do tricks you have to place the toggle in the exact correct place (at least pretty spot on). You also have to land in a specific position or else you crash (too many crashes makes it so you can't finish the race). The half-pipe mode is pretty decent though and can range from super easy to insanely hard. Overall a not so bad game for that time.
