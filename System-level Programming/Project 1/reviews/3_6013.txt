Finding a good Dreamcast controller these days is kind of rare, and finding a good Dreamcast controller for the killer fighting games for the Dreamcast is near impossible. The Dream Pad is decent. It's comfortable, and the inclusion of Z & C on the face are great, but they still are in an odd position. One can get used to it, but this would be a second choice for me, or even a third what with the now super rare ASCII Pad FT for Dreamcast (only released in the Asian market) or a Nuby Tech Street Fighter controller for PlayStation and PS2 + a 3 in 1 Dreamcast controller adapter, which accepts PS2 and Saturn controllers as well as a VMU, which can be found at some import gaming web sites. But if all that is too much a hassle for you, then what the heck, get a Dream Pad, since they will not be in stock forever.
