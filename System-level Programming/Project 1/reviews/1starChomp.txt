Despite  comments  emails 've gotten   review,   leave   1-star.   nostalgia goggles  didn' enjoy  story,  graphics,  gameplay,   .   bought  PS2,   FF10, FF9,  FF7.      2002.  FF10 & FF9  liked.  stories & loveable .   FF7   drag.

     positive reviews ("  "),   decided   FF7   playing  2004,  impress .        .  IMHO  major flaw   FF7    "dry" sections   fight-fight-fight    happens storywise (example - climbing  100-floor building   enemy --  dumb section   waste  hour finding  dress).    sections, literally hours pass    story...  feels   step backwards   near-nonexistent stories   original nintendo.

.

  Battle Engine - totally unbalanced.    RPG  provide balance  physical & magical attacks,    near-equal.    RPG     unique  specific skills & weaknesses ( real people-  fighters;   healers).   FF7:

- '  magic... physical attacks  worthless ( 1/4  damage)

-     completely interchangeable.   equip Fire3    & Heal3   girl.      battle, completely flip  ,      healer &  girl   killer.    flip  !   individuality.    identical.  Plus *instant learning*  instant forgetting...  realistic  .

.

,  story,  ,  poorly executed.   basically boils    meteor poisoning  planet' "health" -  simple concept -   writer dances  & adds un- complication.   takes 2+2 = 4     1-5+4-6+2-1+7-2 = 4.  '    gamers , "Huh?   happened?"      story,   lousy script.

Overall, FF7     weakest    FF series (inferior    PS1 -FF9, super nintendo  FF4, FF5, FF6,  inferior  FF10. , listen    -called video  "experts"  "critics!"      lowdown  Final Fantasy VII.
