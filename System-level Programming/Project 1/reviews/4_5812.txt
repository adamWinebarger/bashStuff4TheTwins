The 2 new 32 level episodes for DooM 2 should not be bought for the pc. Why,you ask?For one,back when it was made,you had to pay 50 - 60 bucks for only 64,when you could download more than 3 times that much levels off the internet. Like a growing athlete,it is time for Doom to say goodbye to the spotlight.
(Buy this for PS if you don't have a pc-wait! Everyone has a PC!)
