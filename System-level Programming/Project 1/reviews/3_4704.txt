First of all the game graphics are sharp and fast. The flight physics are on the ball.  When you are looking around in your cockpit this where the game shines.
Shooting a plane is very rewarding with debre falling off(and yes you can in fact shoot wings off planes) and smoke.
Unloading on a plane and then pausing to move the camera all around is worth way more then 5 stars.
Unfortunately the campaign brings it down for imersive play and lasting interest.
This quote from reviewer Filmfanman sums it up perfectly:
  "The campaign modes are the least interseting aspect of the game and leave a lot to be desired. I want a sense of "being there" from my sims, outside of combat. I want detailed debriefings after a mission. I want to feel a sense of camaraderie with my fellow virtual pilots. I want to know who made it back and who didn't. I want to see how many kills my squad mates got so I have a benchmark with which to compete. I don't care if the missions are scripted or dynamic so long as they have that feel that really immerses you in a campaign. The campaigns here fall flat"
But the game is good for a few hours here and there.  And I would encourage you to fly the ones that are not terribly long to get the most out of the simulation aspect.  Otherwise like what someone else said.  It will get boring quick.
 All in all a very solid game where the campaigns brings it down 2 stars.  Sad.
