This title marks Sonic's first launch on more than one platform...three to be exact. Finally a Sonic title is available on, not only Game Cube, but PlayStation 2 and XBox as well. The Story: Dr. Eggman has devised a new plan to take over the world, a newly reincarnated, and upgrated, Metal Sonic. That's right, Sonic's old rival from Sonic CD is back and ready for all new mayhem. It will take more than one hero to foil Eggman this time, It'll take twelve. But when Metal Sonic gets enough power to change into the all mighty Metal Overlord, will Sonic and his friends be enough to stop him? Heroes features a uniqe team based gameplay which includes four teams of three including: Team Sonic (Sonic, Tails and Knuckles), Team Rose (Amy, Big and new comers Cream and Cheese), Team Chaotix (Vector, Espio and Charmy), and Team Dark (Shadow, Rouge and new comer E-123 OMEGA). To add to the fun, each team has their own themed challenge i.e. Rose is easy, Sonic is medium, Dark is Hard and Chaotix is mission based. Also each member has their own affiliation: speed, flight and power. The game will tell you where you will need to use each character's uniqe skills. Overall, it's a bit challenging for a Sonic title, but it's worth checking out.
