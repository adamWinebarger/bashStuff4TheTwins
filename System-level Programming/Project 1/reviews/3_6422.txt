I love the Final Fantasy series, but this is definately the worst one, in my opinion (7 is the best).  It has a pretty good story, but you have to Draw magic from your opponents, and it's just pretty lame.  I guess it's worth the 20 bucks to have this in your collection, but any other Final Fantasy title is better.
