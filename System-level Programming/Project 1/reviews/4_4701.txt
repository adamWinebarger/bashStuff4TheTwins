A police officer I knew got me into this game.  I didn't think much of it because it was essentially the same game design as the venerable DUNE and War Craft games.  One Age of Empires, as originally designed, was never meant to be the huge slug fest that it ultimately turned into.  The icons on the map were meant to be just that; icons representing single armies.  But the players demanded more, and a patch was released allowing multiple units to be manifested on the map.  Result, that icon that was supposed to represent an army suddenly became a single unit in the army.

So, instead of a game where you see elements of civilization compete and clash, as was the intent, new users essentially got another massive army combat game.  Not a big deal.  It was fun all the same.  I was befriended by some guys on the old MS Gaming Zone, and we'd have a blast after work or school, going late at it late at night.  And then on the weekends we'd have marathon games in the morning.

Great fun, lots of fond memories.  I'll never forget my Age of Empire days.

I think the game's well past its peak, but even as a solo effort it's slightly amusing.

Enjoy.
