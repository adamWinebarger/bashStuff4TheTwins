Today i saw this game at the store for 12 bucks, and i'm gonna pick it up since i have a PS2. I rented it 2 times (after that the dumb stores got rid of their copies) and it was better than the sega saturn version. The graphics didn't have the neat lighting effects, but the game was a whole lot more like the pc version. If you have a PC get that version, if you have a ps2 get this version, or both. I'm probably one of the biggest Duke fans in my area, i have the origional Duke 3D for PC, the Atomic Edtion , The sega saturn version(my 1st copy), Duke Manhatten Project, Time to Kill, Land of the Babes, the Duke Nukem album, all of the Duke Nukem action figures, The Duke Nukem screen saver pack, and now this. As the great Duke would say "Holy S@$T!" Any way if you are one of the few who don't have a PS2 yet here's what will happen to this game.. You know how these losers say the game looks flat? Lie! You know how they say the N64 version looks better? They fogot to tell you the game is cut up (no nude chix), and the textures are super-low res. But with this vesion, when you set up your PS2 for smooth texture mapping, it will make all the "2D" images get smooth edges, and the textures will be nice and smooth. Since the game is almost all sprites(which isn't realy a bad thing at all, easier to edit on pc) Every image on screen will look close to a PS2 game! The reason i don't give this 5 stars is because you can't edit it like the PC version.
