Overall NBA Showtime is a pretty nice game. But I guess the NBA Jam formula has just gotten old because I remember Jam on Genesis being more fun. If you have never played Jam this may be great spectactular fun with lots of cool options. Again, this overall is a pretty cool game, not the best but still alright. Midway has now succsesfully created good x-treme football and Basketball games so lets get workin on a baseball one.
