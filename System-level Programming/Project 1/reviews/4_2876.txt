After having tested several joysticks, this is the one I kept coming back to.  I've had a version of this joystick on my system for two years, and have yet to find anything better.  I don't at all agree with the ......  editorial review that says it's got stiff joystick movement.  Quite to the  contrary, it's capable of very subtle movement.
Plus, it's got lots of  features without being over-engineered. I especially like the fact that it  comes with both throttle and rudder control within easy reach.  The button  cluster on the stick itself is very sensibly designed, with all major  buttons a comfortable distance apart.  The hat is cleverly devised as well,  being both solid and flexible.  Most importantly, perhaps, the software,  now at least two years old, is very stable, and allows you complete control  over each button.
Yet, there are some people who might not find this  product enjoyable.  As others have commented, it is a very  right-hand-centric design.  Since there are a host of buttons on the  left-hand side of the base, you can't hold the joystick in your left hand  and access those buttons without crossing your hands.  Also, the cluster of  buttons on the joystick itself are designed to fit the right hand.  If  you're a right-handed person, this design is ergonomically perfect.  It  literally fits in the palm of your (right) hand.  But a left-handed person  has no business whatever buying this product.
Neither does a Mac owner.  This product's USB connectivity, though convenient to Windows users, does  not extend to the Mac.  That's an unfortunate oversight that, one suspects,  wouldn't be all that difficult to correct.
Still, if you only intend to  use this thing on a Windows machine, and if you're right handed, you'd be  hard-pressed to find a better joystick.
