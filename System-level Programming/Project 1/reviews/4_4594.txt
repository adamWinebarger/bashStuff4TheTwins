The first Gabriel Knight game was about a voodoo cult in New Orleans, the second was about a werewolf murder in Germany, and the third is about  vampires.  In this episode Gabriel sets out to solve the abduction of a  man's child and crack the mystery behind an age old Vampire cult.
The  pros of the game are the graphics and controls.  It's really great to be  able to pike the camera at whatever angle you want and examine things.  Everything is rendered so the screen is more than just a backdrop that you  can't peek behind.  Almost everything is something you can examine  closer.
The puzzles are also logical.  They make sence instead of being  wild things like ripping the leaves off a plant and combing them with a  rubber duckie or some other hair-brained idea.  I also loved the animation.  For polygon rendered people and buildings they were impressively  handled.
There were only two things about this game that I have any sort  of beef with.  Firstly the character of Gabriel seemed to have lost a bit  of his tact and charm.  In the first game Gabriel could charm the pants off  of just about anyone he met and could smooth talk his way just about  anywhere he pleased.  Although the voice actor was the same man as the  first GK game he seems to have forgoten Gabriel's smooth cajun accent for a  horribly sounding southern drawl.
And also the game didn't seem to like  my ATI graphics card, so although I had the game for a couple of months I  wasn't able to play it until I upgraded my card to something else.
But  that aside, I'd still reccomend it to any adventure game fan in a  heartbeat!
