This game is excellent. The replay value is infinite- there are many characters, courses, etc. available for the dedicated player to find. On  top of that, there are multiple modes for up to four players (Two or three players is usually enough though- with 4 players people usually get bored)
The graphics are adequate for the game. However, the sound is pretty abysmal. The music is absolutely terrible on almost every course- and it is recommended that you turn it off.
I also would have enjoyed a create-a-player mode. However, this game is the best fun golfing can offer with its many courses, characters, and game modes.
