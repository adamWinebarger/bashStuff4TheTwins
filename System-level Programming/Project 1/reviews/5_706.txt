I just finished this game, and I really enjoyed it. If you like adventure games, you'll love this. The graphics are spectacular, and there are many new areas for you to explore as you journey though the game. There are many  more areas in this game than you typically find in any type of computer  game. Plus, the characters are great, and it actually has a storyline that  would stand up quite well all by itself. My only complaint would be that  some of the puzzles didn't make sense to me. At one point, you take a piece  of tape off the wall, and all of a sudden a character will talk to you who  never wanted to talk to you before. That's just one example. Many of the  puzzles do make sense, though. I still think this is a game that any  adventure gamer would enjoy.
