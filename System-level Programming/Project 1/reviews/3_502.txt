Welcome to street fighter in 3-D, Great concept right? On the plus side the game is done fairly well, balanced, decent animation & graphics. New characters are nowhere near as memoriable as the older Street Fighters, many are just flat out ripoffs... (Pullim is basically Cammy but black & dressed like a genie)1/2 the cast plays like Ryu. 1/2! Allen, Akuma, Sakura, Ken, Evil Ryu, Kairi,Shin Akuma... Enough is enough. Still it is worth a rent if you like Street Fighter.
