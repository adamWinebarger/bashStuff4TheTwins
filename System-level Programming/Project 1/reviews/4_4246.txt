House of the Dead (the arcade) is the reason I bought a DreamCast. I played it at a local movie theater about 2 months ago and realized and I wanted it at home. I did a little research and found out that not only was a home version out, it was very affordable and a perfect arcade port.
This game is great on the Dream Cast if you have a light gun, if you don't this game is not good. The user interface for the game was designed for a light gun, so if you play with a controller it seems unnatural and you have a desaster almost as big as trying to play Virtual On without the twin sticks. ...
If you do not have the gun, strongly consider buying the "Stringer Light Blaster & House Of The Dead 2 Bundle Pack" by Pelican. ...
