If you are a roller coaster or amusement park enthusiast, then you will find this game entertaining, at least for a while.  The problem with the game is that you can pretty easily build all of the rides and attractions, and then you don't really have that much to do.  This game simply lacks the mental challenges that are needed to make a game like this a masterpiece.
Overall, it has excellent animation, graphics, and virtual reality features, like when you ride your own roller coasters.
I would recommend this game for a novice "Sim" player or for children/teenagers.  Above that, it isn't challenging enough to make it worth your while.
