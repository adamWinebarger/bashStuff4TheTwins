Okay this game is the reason they created difficulty settings. Some of the stars are just plain infuriating to get. And it has the exact same plot as every other Mario game. OMFG Bowser stole Peach whatever shall we do?! Get an ugly princess or something! And where the hell are the king and queen anyways?! The hats were also poorly implemented. The Flying cap is hard to use, the metal cap is rare, at best, and the computer can still see you when you use the invisible cap. They should have stuck to the 2D side scroller. And also where is Yoshi?! The fact that in later levels the edge of the map is always a bottomless pit is also frustrating.
