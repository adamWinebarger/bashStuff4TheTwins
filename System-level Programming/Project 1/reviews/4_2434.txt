when i bought my N64 i really suffered for games, it seem like no one had N64 the games,EVENTUALLY i was able to aquire game like Doom N64 / Duke Nuken ect..... with less than ordinary graphics in comparison to when i got my memory epansion, Then came games like Donkey Kong 64 , Perfect dark , Zelda Majaora's Mask, well  let say that i really was impress to see the full potential of the N64 ,i always wondered why??? for the power that N64 had it was hard to see how Ps1 was so much more popular than N64, i know N64 had some really great games and the graphic was superior to Ps1, anyhow if you are a serious gamer the expansion pak is a must have and also you can experience the full potential of the N64 laterzzzz folks / gamers.....
