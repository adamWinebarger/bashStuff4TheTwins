Grand Theft Auto - Circa 1997

GOOD:

- The roots or start of a super popular franchise

- Sort of fun and different in it's own way

BAD:

- Really, really dated graphics, even for its day

- Gameplay is pretty old and controls can be tough for some

WILL IT FIT YOUR TASTE:

- A Top-down run and gun game where you steal cars, kill people, and live a life of crime

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:

- Grand Theft Auto: London 1969

- Grand Theft Auto 2

- The legend of Zelda: A link to the past (but a lot more urban and violent)

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

- There is a version of this game for Game Boy Advance

- There is a version of this game that comes packed with Grand Theft Auto: London 1969

- All three levels (or cities) in this game later on became their own Grand Theft Auto game, example the first level is liberty city which is the city from GTAIII, The second level is Vice city which is the same city from GTA: Vice City, and last but not least is the third level San Andreas which is the same city/state for GTA: San Andreas
