Well...I must say that this game is just that: it's not the best game ever, but it is really fun and you'll play it a lot supposing you like D&D/AD&D or RPG's.  That being said, allow me to get to the nitpicky stuff.
One major gripe with this game that I have is teh experience system.  It divides up the experience rather then give each party member an exact copy of the amount recieved.  Another problem is the amount of "Cosmetic" strikes and how you miss a lot.  I guess that is for "realism" but it just annoys me. Also, sometimes the game is REALLY non-linear so you have to get a guide or talk to EVERYONE in a place to see where you need to go.
Other than that, this game is really good and will keep you playing it forever.  The story is really good and the rest of the game is good, I will not spill details, although most of you have already gotten the game and beaten it.  Well i must go, hope you enjoyed the review...
