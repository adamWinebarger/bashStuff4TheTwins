Resident Evil 2 - Circa 1998

GOOD:

- An upgrade over the original, which was considered a great game

- Considered classic to many gamers

- Good story, with twists and turns

BAD:

- Graphics look very dated

- Voice acting is not that great

- Controls feel dated

WILL IT FIT YOUR TASTE:

- Slow moving "survival horror" game, which is more about moving boxes, managing items, and unlocking doors then actually fighting for your life

- A Sc-Fi horror game set in a city over run with zombies, huge snakes, and all types of creatures

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:

- Dino Crisis

- Silent Hill

- Alone in the dark

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

- There is a remake of this game for the Nintendo 64 and Nintendo Game Cube both of which don't really upgrade anything

- The male playable character (Leon) is also the star of Resident Evil 4

- Beating the game in a certain way can unlock two new characters "Hunk" and "Tofu"

- There was a rumor that you could unlock Akuma from Street Fighter Alpha as a playable character, but that is not true

- In Japan Resident Evil 2 is called Biohazard 2
