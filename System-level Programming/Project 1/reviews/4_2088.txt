I see myself as a guru of Survival Horror games, I like'em and I like what they make me feel. Now let's get on with my review for Resident Evil 2.

I have to first mention that I did not and will not buy Resident Evil 2 or Resident Evil 3 for Gamecube... unlike Resident Evil Remake they have nothing new to offer me or you... which is sad after seeing what they did and what improvement remake was to the original Resident Evil. So let's just keep this review centered around the Original Resident Evil 2 game for PSX 1.

Comparing RE 2 to RE or RE Director's Cut is like comparing Raw Horsemeat to a young Stallion. Resident Evil 2 had better graphics and sound by far, not to mention the fact that it was on a bigger bolder scale than Resident Evil. Simple bottom line folks is that if your looking for a GOOD Survival Horror game... pick this one up.

I had no real gripes towards the game and I felt that the DEVs of the game did everything in the better interest for the Resident Evil genre. As you can see by the score that I gave this game, I liked it and I truly think you'd like it aswell.
