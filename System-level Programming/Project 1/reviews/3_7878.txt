The one good thing about this game is the multiplayer, which is why I gave it 3 stars. When I was having a sleepover, we played the multiplayer mode all night. But there is always something bad though, and that is the single-player mode. I beat the game on agent in a week, which was too easy, but trying it on Special Agent was too hard. And the guns are horrible. So if you are bored you can get your friends over and play a couple of rounds of multiplayer, but otherwise the game isn't that great.
