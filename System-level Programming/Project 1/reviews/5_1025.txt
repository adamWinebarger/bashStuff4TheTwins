This is one of the most fun multiplayer games you can play on the Nintendo 64.  The single player portion of the game is enjoyable too but the real fun is in the multiplayer and racing and battling your friends.  My friends and I logged countless hours with this game.  The only negative I have is the AI cheats something awful in the single player portion but aside from that it's a great game in every sense and a true classic.
