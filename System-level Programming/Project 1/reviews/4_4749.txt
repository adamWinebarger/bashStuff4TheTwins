This game introduced me at a young age to communial development planning, and money management. This game is, I guess you could say, one to grow with, it takes time and it helps one to learn along the way. I'd also like  to add that it helps, especially a younger mind, to experience freedom with  their money allowing them to spend it as they choose. If he/she spends it  unwisely (go bankrupt) that person will know to become better managers of  their money the next time.
