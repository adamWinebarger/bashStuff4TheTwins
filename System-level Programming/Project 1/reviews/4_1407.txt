Surprisingly I never got a chance to play the original on the computer, but the N64 version seems to portray the insanity well. As I understand it the weapons, enemies and level textures are the same, but the actual level designs are N64-exclusive, which is a neat touch. Much like the first Quake it's not a thinking man's shooter like Perfect Dark or GoldenEye, but there are some surprising elements such as the enemies that take potshots at you in their death throes. And while there's no online component, it offers a commendable split-screen experience.

The N64 did well with shooters, and Quake II is a solid addition to the library. My only real gripe is with the series itself; from this point on we lost the moody Gothic feel of the original for something much more sci-fi. Still, that may not matter when the enemies come tearing into you.
