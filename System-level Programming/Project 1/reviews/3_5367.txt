What can really be said besides the fact that its South Park, its racing, and its crazy.  The controls aren't the best or most responsive in this game.  And it's more than a little annoying that you can't just choose any map when playing multiplayer and playing a map in multiplayer does not unlock any further maps.  My guess is you have to unlock them in the single player campaign.  More than anything else its clearly a game that someone didn't lose any sleep over (even while working to make it) and was put out there to cash in on the South Park franchise.  But if you're a die-hard video game person and you have a jones for the South Park gang to somehow be involved then this game is worth the handful of dollar bills.
