Omega Boost - Circa 1999

GOOD:

- Overall fun game to play

- Fast and furious gameplay

BAD:

- Graphics might look a little dated

- Controls can be a little tough

- Game gets pretty is tough on higher levels

- Short game with no real unlockables or bonus

IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:

- A 3D shooter which plays like a fast and furious version of Panzer Dragoon

- Simplistic arcade style presentation

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:

- Panzer Dragoon

- Colony Wars

- Zone of Enders

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

- Static X (the 90's rock band) did some of the soundtrack I believe
