While playing the game you realize there isn't much variety. The bike is really hard to control. Overall though, the worst part of the game is that it is only a 1 person game. It would be better if you could race against another player and not just the clock. My 7 year old daughter doesn't even play with it, she prefers to try to compete with me or her dad. So, if you have a child that likes to play alone they might enjoy it. Otherwise it would probally collect dust.
