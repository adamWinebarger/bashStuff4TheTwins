This was a curiosity purchase that sat for awhile.  I finally fired it up on an XP machine.  Do get the upgrade if you can find it.

There are 48 scenerios in the self play.  The AI is ok.  If you are a defensive player, you will like this game.

The scenerios range from what feels like a demo of new features.  For example, when the cannons first appear, you get one scenerio defending a pass.  I didn't ahve to do anything as the cannon fire wiped out that attackers that kept charging into the guns.

The hardest scenero for me was vengence.  You are warned to set up before detecting and it is true.  I got noticed and was swarmed.  I built of up defenses in order to build the army.  Unfortunatly, the AI dug in rather well and it took a constant barrage of air armadas of dragons and fairies to defeat the well placed towers.  Each tower was coverd by the others.

The GUI can get annoying as if you don't pay attention and click you will send units or builders in a direction you didn't intend.

The gold dragon was a fun introduction.  Though I will admit it made the fighting easier.

The story line is good.  However, you will switch between sides during the play.  It gets a little strange at times as you invade and set up a base.  Then the next scenerio you play the otherside and are supposed to destroy the base.

Overall it's not a bad game.  Especially at current prices.

I am going ot look for the addon.
