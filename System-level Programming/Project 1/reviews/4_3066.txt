I saw this game, and it looked amusing, so I got it. I soon found out that it had unique gameplay and was unlike any game I had played in the past. It's really fun, and you get hooked on it. Plus the unlockable mini games are a cool bonus. The problem was the camera (which could really be annoying at some times) and the challenge. Here's my tip: If you're an advanced gamer, 12 or older, rent this game, but do not buy. Most 11 year olds, and even some 10 year old have found this game easy. But if you're younger than that, you'll go ape over this game.
