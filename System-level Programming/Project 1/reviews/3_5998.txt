Amber is different than most games you've been playing. There are no puzzles to solve. That's right! No tricks, no frustration. Amber is the name of a paranormal psychic energy -measuring device that leads your friend Roxy to utilize the new equipment in an old haunted house.  Something goes awry and you travel to this home to see what happenned to Roxy and her new equipment.  Sound fun? It is.
Mysteries. Mysteries. Why is Roxy unconscious wearing the Amber head gear in the garage, of all places?  Should you experiment with the equipment? Sure.  Beware as you follow in your friend's footsteps while trying to figure what happened to her. This PC game is fun. It takes you through portals of time to uncover the secret of the hauntings. I found the game to be quite thrilling. Things really do go bump in the night!
So why only three stars? While the idea of mystery puzzles vs. physical ones seems original and fun, the game is easy.  A young high schooler could figure the "moves" out. You are given a place, a circumstance, and an enviroment with tools. Everything you need to solve the mystery is staring you in the face. Go ahead and give it a go. The plot, first-person scenario, and all the truly frightening hauntings make this an easy going game. A perfect breather to play in between the usual brain-frying choices.
