It is really a shame that this game was never updated for windows XP. You can run most of the features, but the practice shooting range no longer works and this is an important feature. You need to practice to do well in solving the puzzles. I wrote to them a while back but they showed no interest in providing a fix. I guess they made their money and don't care.
