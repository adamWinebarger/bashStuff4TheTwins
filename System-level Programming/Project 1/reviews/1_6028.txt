I used to love playing Quake 2. I played it for hours on end. When I heard about it's impending release in 1997, I was stoked and could hardly wait for it to come out. And what did I do when it did? I played it AT LEAST 3 to 4 days a week from 1997 to early 2002. And guess what? I became freakin sick of it! I do not want to play this game ever again for the rest of my existence on this earth!! (Well, at least for 10 years or so) My point is, after you log hours and hours of gameplay, it starts to get old. FAST. Quake 2 may be a legendary game but I warn you don't overindulge. Play Max Payne, Deus Ex or Unreal Tournament 2003 instead.
