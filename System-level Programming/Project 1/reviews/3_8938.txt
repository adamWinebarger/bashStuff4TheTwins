As the first game in my SNES game collection, I had high hopes for it as I loved the movie it was based on. It uses a top down perspective while walking around the island and uses a 3D look a la Doom when exploring the various buildings and caves while offering you multiple weapons to use. It uses the likenesses of the dinosaurs and some of the main characters that appeared in the movie. The graphics, sounds and music are spot on and help you get into the game. It controls very easily and you get used to quickly. So why do I give this game 3 stars?

First off, this is a VERY LONG, exploratory and adventure game. The island is huge and you have to explore caves and buildings, which in its own, eats up a lot of time. Aside from figuring out which weapons to use against which dinosaurs, your memory skills will be tested as the game offers no hints as to which direction you should do or how to complete tasks. No map system is available while underground or in buildings so you'll get lost plenty of times. You start out with 5 lives and have infinite continues but no password or save system is available. If you intend to beat this game, you'll have to do it in one shot. After you finished all the objectives, you head back to the helipad. There, you get treated to the game's ending: the intro presentation of landing on the helipad when you first start playing....in reverse.

And that's it. It took me almost 4 hours to beat it and after seeing the game's ending, I was so disgusted that I went to my local game shop and sold it for some $$$. Bottom line: it's not worth it for the time and effort you spend on playing or beating this game.
