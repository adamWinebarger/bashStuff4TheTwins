Very good for the first 4 stages, but, after stage 4, you will be in Sigma's Fortress to defeat Vile, and believe me, this is the most frustrating stage I have ever played on any game! If you thought the first 4 stages were hard, you are in big trouble, because, after you defeat Vile, you have to go through hell just to make it to Boomer Kwanger and after Kwanger, you have to defeat the most frustrating boss of the stage, the Bobspider! Unless you love frustration, I would not reccommend this game, as it gets much harder to the point that you completely put the game down.
