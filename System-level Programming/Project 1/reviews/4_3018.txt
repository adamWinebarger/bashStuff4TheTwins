This game is great! It's not as good as Myst, but it's still impressive. This games backs right up to Myst, so if you hann't played Myst, you will have NO idea on whats going on! Somthing thats better the Myst, the grapics. I don't know how good they are on PC because I've got the playstation virsion, but the graphics on that are awsome! My opinion on buying it or renting it is you should buy it if you've played and BEATEN Myst. But Bloskbuster donen't carry this game.
