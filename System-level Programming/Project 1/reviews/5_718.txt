You awake in a fairy tale world in a forest of faires, in front of you is the pinnacle of a hero of time, a ordinary child named link, thrown into a story of magical tragedy, love and war, fighting with swords, boomerangs and countless items in this open world rpg, adventure game. a classical magical artistic story of dark hope. From the moment i entered the tree, my deepest childish heart was immersed by The spooky chilling song of wonderus oblivion,  played with a dida jiu, envoks the dark gothical environment of smokey earth, a hidden sign of our own earthly desires and self destruction. the rest of the music is amazing and fits each place perfectly. I really like the hyrule field song of mystery and adventure. You gather items such as slingshots, bombs, magic spells, and the sword of time. This allows you to go to times and alter the other time to your advantage. The sun and moon take turns with night and day as you run through a beautiful hyrule field, a fire mountain and other magical places.  A legend of revolutionary gaming experience, exploration, story telling, magical youthfulness, a pioneer of open world environments with realistic time cycles. It feels like a real life fairy tale of magical gothical art and adventure. This is one of my biggest inspirational and memorial games and could be yours too.
