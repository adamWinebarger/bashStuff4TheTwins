ok, I admit if I known how bad this game was I still would have bought the game, but I wish I would had waited until the game went down to $19.99 before I wasted almost $50.00 for it. I hope Square makes FF9 better before they waste millions of dollars on another crap  shoot.
Now for my reasons for the 1 star.
1. It was a rip off of FF7. if you want to get FF8  but haven't played FF7 get FF7.
2. Why no voice acting!  I sooooooo recomend it!  C'mon Square at least on the CG movies(pease let FF9 have voice acting)!
3. The characters in the game not just the playable  ones but all of them seem to have no life to them, its just boring how the characters are so dull, I just cant  explain it.
4. Rushed, rushed, rushed, and, rushed. C'mon  Square where is this quality gaming I remember from your other stuff like Chrono Trigger and old classics like that.
5. I don't have anough time to tell you the rest but there  is alot of other stuff.
