This was another three dollar find in a bin at the resale shop.  When I was a kid I loved watching my friends or my brother's friends play this game and many other PS1 games that would later be heralded as classics.  I really didn't enjoy playing the games myself, because even my pre teen self in the mid 90s knew that the controls were absolute garbage.  Here I am twenty years later trying this classic again, and my opinion hasn't changed.

I can't say much about the game because I can't make it further than the first screen on the first board of the game.  You're thrown down in a little cave at the beginning, and your first task is to blindly shoot at a couple of animals who were just minding their own business.  Then you have to find a way out vertically.

The first jump you have to make in this game is ridiculous.  You have to make it to the adjacent rock.  There is a wall to your right preventing you from making a clean jump which also makes the camera go nuts.  Be prepared to make a lot of blind jumps.  It took me twenty minutes to jump to that rock which I promptly fell off.  Another ten minutes go by and I made that jump and got a little further up until I slid off a rock and all the way back down due to the horrible camera angle.  I actually tried to break the controller in half.  I have never been so mad at a game.

So there you have it, that is my review.  I couldn't make it further than the first screen.  If you want a classic tomb raiding experience that you may actually enjoy, check out Tomb Raider Anniversary.  It's a blast, and I actually finished that game.
