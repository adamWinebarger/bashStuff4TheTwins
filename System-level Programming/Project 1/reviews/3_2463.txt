This game is super hard the first time around. Then, when you beat it, and go for another try it is sooo easy. You can get through 1/2 the game in an hour, because almost all of it is puzzles, so when you figure them out after 1/2 an hour next time it takes 1 minite. Also i found it fristating that there are no big fights, where you can fight about 20 battle droids. The biggest, funnest fight is in the very beggining, when you are up against 6 battle droids. If Lucas Arts had put in a few more units, and better levels, this game would be worth buying, but as it is it is not all that good.
