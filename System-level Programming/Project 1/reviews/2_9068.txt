Although this game has different playability than Risk 1 and good graphics, it is the cheatenist game I've ever played, it is nigh impossible to win these games, except only occasionally, and by then you are too worn out from trying to win to enjoy it. I would not bother with it, stick with Risk 1, the original. I'm an old risk player from way back, I used to play the board game with my brother in law many years ago, and I have the pc version of original Risk,and even though that game cheats as do all computer games, it's not near half as bad as risk 2.
