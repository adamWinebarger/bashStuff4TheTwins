Lord,

It has been too darn long since I last played this master piece.

The single player mode is too much fun. But, the 99% of the credit goes to the multi game mode.

Great selection of weapons, nice variety of levels, Huge list of characters to choose from (from the original bond movies), fun options while playing (Bobble head characters, paint ball shooting marks).

I am telling you the game was the center of attention with friends. Large gatherings, challenges, playing till the break of dawn. I will give the game credit from keeping us off the streets =) .

I don't know if I can find this game, but boy if you can! Find three friends and Play it without mercy.

All the best,

Nawaf
