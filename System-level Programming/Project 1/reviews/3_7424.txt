When you look at the painstakingly long list of comic licensed games that were released for the 16-bit systems of years ago, most were basically just walk from left to right while beating up countless generic villians in a game which lacks any kind of spirit or feel of the comic it is based from and is pretty much Streets of Rage with a comic license attached to it (notably most of which were published by Acclaim or one of their other publishing divisions). Maximum Carnage is based on the mid-nineties massive event that took place in the Spider-Man comics in which Spidey had to team up with Venom to take on Carnage in a ravaged New York. In the game, you can play as Spidey or Venom, and you pretty much do all as I described above, and thats about it. Almost none of these games had any kind of save feature, and Maximum Carnage is one of these games, and it is a painstakingly long game to finish and does offer some high difficulty. Maximum Carnage's few saving graces are the game's music provided by Green Jelly (although it sounds a bit generic at times considering the Genesis didn't have the best soundchip imaginable) and the fluid and colorful graphics. There are a few guest appearances from other heroes (Firestar, Captain America) and you've got some tough villians in Carnage, Shreik, Doppleganger, and Demogoblin, but other than that Maximum Carnage is only a bit better than the heap of comic licensed 16-bit beat 'em ups.
