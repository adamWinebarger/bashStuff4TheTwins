This game is average. It is a pretty fun sim. I played it for about a month straight. You get to make your dream theme park. One problem i didn't really like is there isn't enough room in the parks. It gets pretty boring when there isn't enough room to build a really cool roller coaster you want to build. But all and all this game is fun.
