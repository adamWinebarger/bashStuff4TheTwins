I am confused by the claims that this joystick does not work with XP.  XP is plug-and-play: just hook up the USB adapter and plug the thing in.  It registers perfectly.  Go to control panel and mess with the calibration and test all your buttons - that works perfectly as well.  One drawback in not being able to use the W95 software is a lack of ability to reprogram the buttons - no biggie since most software will let you do the same, but I dropped one star for that reason.  XP users - don't concern yourself with the disk that comes with the joystick, just plug the thing in and get on with the games!
