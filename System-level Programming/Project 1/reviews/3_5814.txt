For those who hate gore, violence & evil creatures, this game's not for you...For starters, it's a violent shooting game sequel from PSX's DOOM version...Unlike in Duke Nukem 3D, you cannot jump nor crouch...The enemies are the same but they're more plenty...The mazes are harder but your weapons are still the same...Even though they've added extra levels like Plutonia and TNT, the graphics and the handling are quite the same...But don't fret, idSoftware would release DOOM III sometime this month on PC.
