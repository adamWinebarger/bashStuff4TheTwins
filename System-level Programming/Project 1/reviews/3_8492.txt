When Killer Instinct became a smash hit on the Super NES, it seemed inevitable that a stripped down conversion would come to the GameBoy.  This portable version of Killer Instinct is missing a fighter or two, but the graphics and overall gameplay remain remarkably faithful to it's arcade and 16-bit counterpart.  The two button control scheme makes the crazy multi-hit combos easier than ever before to pull off, but special moves themselves can be a pain to do.  Not to mention due to the fact this is a game for the original black and white GameBoy the graphics are very hard to see, especially if the background arena is dark.  Some of this can be corrected thanks to a lighting option offered in the game's option screen, but problems still persist.  All in all, Killer Instinct may not be the same great fighter it was in the arcades and on home systems, but it is one of the better original GameBoy fighters available.
