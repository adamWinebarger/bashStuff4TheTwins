This X game was just tedious.  I remember the original X game on the SNES was fun, as were X2 and X3, but this one was just bad.  Playing as X or Zero was fun, but Zero was hard to control and both storylines were, well, boring.  I was almost to the point of yawning.  Plus, it was easy to figure out who the final boss was for anyone who has ever played an X game.  Additionally, some of the upgrades to Xs armor made him harder to operate, and, well, I guess what I really want to say is this was boring.  I was bored stiff.  I couldn't wait to beat it so I could move on to something else.  Unlike X, X2 and X3, there is almost no replay value in this game.  I mean, beyond the cheat codes for the special X armor and Dark Zero, nothing.  I only hope that X5 and X6 are better, but I'm not sure if they will be.
