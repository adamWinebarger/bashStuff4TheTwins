Watch out with this one.  If you have a newer graphics card like a Geforce2 then you will not be able to get the 3D graphics.  This game does not support 3d acceleration with newer cards. I was really upset when I learned I would have to buy an older Voodoo card just to get better graphics on this game.  A great game other than that, but if you want the highest graphics, make sure you also have an Voodoo compatible video card.
