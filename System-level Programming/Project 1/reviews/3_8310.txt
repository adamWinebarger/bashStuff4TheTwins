THIS GAME IS VERY DARK. Turn up the brigness on your tv before you play it. Never play if you're easily depressed:-( Ranges from very easy to very impossible. I don't even know if it's worth buying unless you're a collector. You could probably find it for very little because it's a Player's Choice awarded game.
