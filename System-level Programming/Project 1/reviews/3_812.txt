Hands down the hardest game of the first three.  The graphics were better and Lara had new moves.  But the game took an almost insane turn for hardness.  Not the best pick for your first Tomb Raider experience.
The game is cool that you can complete the stages in any order after completing the first one, India.  Also stealth is involved in some areas like Nevada.  Better to not tangle with all the guards.  The new save feature is pretty lame though.  Instead of keeping the excellent save anywhere mode from the last game, they made you collect save crystals.  And to be bluntly honest there aren't enough in the game.  Makes the game more frustrating than it needs to be.  Thank goodness for cheat codes right?  Still a solid game and worth adding to your Playstation collection though.
