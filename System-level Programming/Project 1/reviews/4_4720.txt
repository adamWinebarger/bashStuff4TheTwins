Microsoft has given all other WW2 simulators a challenge. This game has great graphics and gameplay and at times good cinemas, but not the greatest.  It's hard to play without a joystick and a good system, if your  speed is not a Pentium 2 or higher it could be a little slow. It's still  fun though. The missions are fun and fast paced, although it takes a while  to get used to and be able to handle the plane. Also in battle it's  sometimes hard to get the other planes, but the bombers you'll probably get  on your first try but it still takes a while to get the others. There are a  number of different aircrafts, but only a couple available in each mission.  It is a challenging and fun game, I reccomend it to people who like air  combat and flight games.
