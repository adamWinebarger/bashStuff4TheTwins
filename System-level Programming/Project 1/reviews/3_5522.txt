I always have have mixed feelings about the 'Heroes' games. They are a combination of 'Civilization' and RTSs like 'Starcraft' with a turn-based combat engine thrown in, I really enjoy the building and exploration parts. However when I get ready to start conquering, most times I find opponents who are ten times more powerful than I am. Most Herons maps require either a quick rush or a 'build combat force only' tactic. This is especially true on Large and eXtra-Large maps. If loved previous Heroes installments this one is more of the same. If you've never played Heroes before it's harder to recommend since the gameplay is monolithic. Fortunately you can pickup other editions such as Heroes III dirt-cheap. I encountered no technical issues playing this game.
