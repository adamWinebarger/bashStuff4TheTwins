The final instalment of the series on Playstation 1 doesn't disappoint. This is a classic game, an all time great. Although not as good as it's two prequals, Res Evil 3 makes up for it with improved graphics and an amazing mercenaries game. The hard mode also offers the most difficult of challenges ever seen on the PS One. If you are a fan of the series then you MUST own this. Some gamers may feel it's too easy iof they complete the game but try it on Hard Mode and then try the mercenaries and you get all the challenge you could ever ask for. The only reason why I've given 4 stars instead of 5 is the basic fact, Res Evil 1 and 2 are both better. But don't let that stop you buying it, this is a game that offers challenge, new enemies, harder puzzles and throws further into the series' evil, intricate plot. A classic game.
