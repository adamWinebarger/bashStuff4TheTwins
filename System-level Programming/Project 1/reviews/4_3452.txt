This is a classic that took fighting games to a new level. Although i am a Mortal Kombat fan, i admit that this game is actually cool to a certain point. The second one is alot better and the third one is pretty sweet. However, you must remember the humble beginings of Super hero/ Street fighter games. I like it.
