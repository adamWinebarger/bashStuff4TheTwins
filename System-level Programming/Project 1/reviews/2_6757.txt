I really had my heart set on Toy Commander and when I got it, the game just didn't deliver! The game concept is really cool on paper but it didn't translate into a good game. The jerky camera which comes as a result of the poor vehicle control actually makes me sick everytime I play it! Control is so important in any 3D game and this game just lacking, big time!
The multi player mode is also disappointing as the small vehicles get lost among the colourful stages. The game is just not fun! The graphics and the sounds are great but the game is just lacking in the fun department.
I'm sorry people but the bottom line is that you can pass on this game and be quite contented because you saved a couple of bucks.
