After replaying both RE and RE2 from my childhood days; I couldn't wait to buy RE3 since I had missed that one growing up and was dying to try it out. Well... I've had the game for a few nights (7 hours gameplay) and have already beaten it. And I gotta say it was a fun ride, but I'm kind of disappointed. I'm a huge Resident Evil fan and I've been wanting to play this game for years.

Don't get me wrong the game was very entertaining and still withheld the ability to scare the hell out of me. I did enjoy it a lot, but it just doesn't justify itself as much of a sequel in my opinion.

Here's why.

First off, whats up with the difficulty modes? You're only given two choices; Hard or Easy. And their both screwed up. Why?

EASY MODE:
- The game starts you (Jill) off with an assault rifle and 3 F.Aid sprays.
- Enemies are way too easy to shrug off.
- Jill can take up to 6 bites from a zombie and still be in "Fine" condition.
- You have infinite ink ribbons.
- All of the weapons in the game are already unlocked and located in your storage crate.
- You have massive amounts of ammo for each gun already in the storage crate. (And I'm talking MASSIVE) For example: 250 Handgun rounds, 76 Shotgun shells, and 2 100% AR clips.
- Picking up ammo, Gun powder, and health items is pointless since you already have enough of each to last you to the end of the game.
- It is not much of a challenge.

Needless to say, I quickly changed from Easy to Hard mode after the first 10 minutes of playing. I usually don't like playing Hard mode on any game. But it didn't leave me much of a choice, and being a RE veteran I figured I could handle it. In other words, Easy mode was obviously designed for newbies and people that absolutely SUCK.

HARD MODE:
- You start with almost no ammo at all.
- Jill takes too much damage even from the smallest attacks.
- The new "dodging" feature is nearly impossible to use.
- Nemesis is way too strong and can kill you in one or two hits.
- Jill's inventory is very small. Unlike the first Resident Evil.
- Zombies respawn after you enter and exit a room. (True, considering the situation and environment does make sense. Like its impossible to kill every zombie in the city.)

Nonetheless I completed the game on Hard. Having died 3 or 4 times being annihilated by Nemesis. My only question is... why wasn't there a "Normal" or "Original" mode to play? I like to be challenged and enjoy the game at the same time. Playing on Hard was difficult and irritating. Especially when you have an 8 ft. monster on your tail most of the time.

Secondly, the story.

STORY:
To sum it all up the story is about Jill desperately trying to escape Raccoon city alive. And the first part of the story actually takes place like a day before the events of Resident Evil 2. The main conflict in the story is that Umbrella corp. has secretly dispatched a mutant tyrant called "Nemesis" into Raccoon city to seek out and destroy all the remaining S.T.A.R.S members. Namely Jill and Brad Vickers. I won't spoil the ending for anyone and I think most RE fans know what happens anyway.

What I didn't like about the story was that it was too confusing. Like, who is Nemesis?? Where did he come from?? I mean seriously whats his origin? Also, in RE2 Leon and Claire were looking for Chris, who we later discovered had traveled to Europe. But your telling me that Jill was in the city the whole time? And not once did Leon and Claire cross paths with her? Come on...

Another thing that doesn't make sense (keep in mind this is before RE2) is when Jill makes her way into the R.P.D. building only to find that half of the doors are boarded up/barricaded having no access. Which would contradict RE2's plot altogether. How would Leon and Claire get around the building? It doesn't make any sense. Why didn't they just have all of the doors Jill didn't need to go in locked? The story itself is pretty clustered. And it's really not even a story, its more like a side-story. It just seems that it was really rushed through and not a lot of thought was put into it.

Thirdly, the Nemesis.

NEMESIS:
Despite what I said earlier.. I thought that Nemesis was a great addition to the game. He definitely adds to the suspense and you never know when or where he's going to pop up and surprise you. However, it doesn't take long to get tired and frustrated with him. Mainly because there were a lot of areas in the city that I wanted to explore but couldn't because I was being pursued by Nemesis!!! And he shows up like 15 minutes apart from each appearance. So, exploring or not he'll always turn up sooner or later. And yes you can fend him off. But there's really no point since he's nearly impossible to kill, and your only wasting precious ammo and health trying to fight him.  By the way, some of you may remember Mr. X from RE2... well there's a big similarity between the two. Their both huge mutant zombies that stalk you throughout the game. So its quite obvious that Nemesis was a variation of Mr. X.

Pros:
RE3 did improve and add some great new features. Such as... The new "dodge" feature that really adds to the gameplay and helps a ton when your in combat. It took Capcom 3 games to finally add the 180 degree spin; which enables you to turn around quickly and run to avoid danger. I also liked the new "Gun powder" mixing feature, which enables you to create ammunition for your weapons. There is a lot of action and surprises in the game. Adding the interactive environmental objects (explosive barrels, etc.) was a nice feature and really helped in difficult situations. I did really like the outdoor environment in the game. I thought that was a nice break-away from the first two games. And finally, you don't need to press the action button to go up or down a flight of stairs.

Cons:
The graphics are the same as in RE and RE2 only with slight improvement on the character models and design. The pre-rendered environments don't look as good or dark as in RE2 but are still nice. The game itself is very short compared to the first two, and the only playable character is Jill. The camera angles can get annoying sometimes, especially when there is an enemy blocking your view. (This problem is in the first two games also.) It wasn't as scary, exciting, or suspenseful as RE and RE2. But still has moments that make you jump out of your seat. And lastly, it lacks a story.

Conclusion:
Bottom line, RE3:Nemesis is a good game. It's fun, scary, and entertaining. And no its not the best, and in my opinion its the weakest game in the series. And anyone who disagrees, obviously hasn't played the first two. But I will cut it some slack because Resident evil 3 had a lot to live up to. And it was because Resident Evil 2 really set a high standard for the series. Lets face it, Resident Evil 2 was a legendary game, and quite possibly the greatest sequel to any video game in history. I just think that RE3 could of been a better sequel. And it isn't as good as its predecessor.

Final Rating: 3.8/5
