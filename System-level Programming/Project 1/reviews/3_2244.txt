This game is like, Blast Corps only you can go into all the Houses.  Driving around and shooting thing's is Kinda' fun, But it can get boring.  The game seem's to be more like an RPG game, And since I like RPG's I  enjoyed the game a little bit. But, it's not really a game you'd want, To  go back and Play.
