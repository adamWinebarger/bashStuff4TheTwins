Graphics: 6/10 &#8211; Not too flash really, there isn't much to look at here. The aeroplanes look nice when you're checking out which one to fly in, but in the air, it's mostly just a nice shade if blue.
Sound: 6/10 &#8211; I can remember the background plane noises, but the shooting sounds could've been more bang-crash-WAM!
Value: 5/10 &#8211; If you play a lot of games that are based around things in the air or aeroplanes, this isn't the pick of the litter. It is worth buying for a price under $..., but you might not be interested if you aren't willing to get fly-wise.
Overall: 6/10 &#8211; Definitely not a poor game, it will teach you with its intelligence how to fly a simulator plane, but don't expect the entertainment level to be through the roof.
