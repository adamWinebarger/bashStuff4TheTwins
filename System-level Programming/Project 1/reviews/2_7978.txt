Alien Ressurection the game, makes the movie of the same title look like an Oscar winning masterpiece (well, ok maybe not).  The only reason it got two stars was for the awesome atmosphere and graphics that this game has to offer plus the level of geniune fear and suspense that it conjurs up.
Now for the bad...nothing ever really happens in this game.  At times, it is downright BORING.  You wander around in the pitch black half the time waiting for something really bad to happen...but it never does.  When I say this game is dark, I mean dark as in no light.  You can't see half the time and the worthless flashlight that you have runs out of batteries every five minutes.  The controls are sloppy and unnecessarily difficult.  The weapons/ammo are limited and you really have to search for them in some of the later levels which makes the game seem contrived, like they added that feature only to make the game longer.  Alien Trilogy was a much better game.  Like the Alien movies, too many sequels makes for a predictable and downright boring ride.
