This box set is a wonderful addition to any Legend of Zelda collection! This set includes 6 Prima Guides, a metal bookmark, a certificate of authenticity, and a magnetic-closure treasure chest. The Prima guides included are for the games: Ocarina of Time 3D, Spirit Tracks, Phantom Hourglass, Wind Waker HD, Twilight Princess, and Skyward Sword. The guides speak for themselves, they walk you through all aspects of these games, giving you tips and help to complete the games. All of the books are high-quality hard cover, with gold-edged pages. I am a huge fan of the Legend of Zelda, and this box set was a perfect addition to my collection. I would recommend this box set to any fan of this franchise, plus the price on Amazon can't be beat!
