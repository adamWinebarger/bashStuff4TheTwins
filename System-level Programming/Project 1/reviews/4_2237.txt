Rockstar games later went on to use the game engine and flight mechanics as well as the swimming and other parts of his game to improve what most of you would refer to as GTA:SA and GTA:4, one could be labored to suggest that this game allowed and was the father of said games. In the gaming industry it happens often that one game either spawns or helps improve the industry standards and this game thou over looked did more for the gaming world then most figure or see.

This game is to GTA, as Ultima Underworld is to Fallout 3, and that is to say they are the for runners that improved future games. I suggest if your looking for good harmless violence without human on human violence I recommend this one if you still use your N64. I would point out, that Human deaths that you allow or preform increase a ticking total and once you get to many you fail the level. So the game even goes so far as to not allow it, I will also add this game has one of the largest number of flying vehicles and ground vehicles and even boats and the likes of almost any game I have ever played in my entire life.
