The days when people said, "We're having a Party, A Mario Party..."  Seems to be long past.  When this game first came out, it seemed to be the only thing people talked about.  Yet today, with 5 Mario Parties in the collection, this one still is wonderful for being the base roots.
Just like any of the other Mario Parties, you choose which character you'd like to be, Mario, Luigi, ect.  The object of the game is to go around the board and collect Stars.  Stars come at a price, 20 coins.  To get 20 coins, you must win mini games or land on blue spots.  This is like an advanced board game for the N64, but with a twist.  In addition to the board game aspect of this game, after everyone takes 1 turn a mini game takes place.
Competitions in this mini game include:
Everyone against eachother
1 Vs 3
2 Vs 2
This is where the intense fun comes on.  You and your friends button smash, spin the analog stick to your hearts content.  As a matter of fact, so much button smashing (fast taps on the buttons)takes place that gloves came out for this game to protect your hand.  Be warned, if you're too competitive with this particular Mario Party, you may wind up with a blistered palm or sore fingers.
It's overall pure fun.  Games can last for hours and hours if you really want.  Though playing a board game on a console sounds dull, this game completely opposite of that!
If you want a great N64 game...this is a must buy.
If you are interested in this game, but don't want to play an older console anymore or don't have a N64, I recommend Mario Party 4 and 5 for the Nintendo Gamecube.  Exceptionally fun, with  quite a bit less dangerous button smashing.
