I have poured hours and hours into this game as a kid, but there is one fatal flaw that affects its overall greatness, and that is the requirement of beating the near-impossible 1981 Donkey Kong arcade game two times with only one life each time. I played the original 1981 arcade game at an arcade place recently, and that is lenient compared to the hair-tearing experience that the one in Donkey Kong 64 will offer you, and the player is required to not only receive a Nintendo coin from beating the arcade game twice, but the game also requires the player to play and beat Jetpac, which is actually more lenient than the original Donkey Kong, but it still can be a mess to beat. On a positive note, the levels are very detailed and beautifully designed, thanks to the Expansion Pak, but the fact that the player is required to beat the original Donkey Kong twice with only one life per attempt killed the fun, as I would put away the game because of that one impossible mini game to cool down, I even had to buy a Gameshark to beat the game the first time around; it was near impossible. I can now beat it without the use of a Gameshark, but I still find it completely unnecessary to hold such a hefty requirement just to beat the game normally, and if it gave the player a different ending I would understand, but the game forces the player to beat those mini games, and while it could add to the challenge factor, it is still completely unnecessary to just merely complete the game normally. I would still recommend the game, as it has some redeeming values such as advanced sound effects and detailed enemy and level designs, but the player must have extreme patience and be fully willing to take a couple of brutal beatings from the original Donkey Kong and Jetpac in order to beat the game.
