Quake 3 is completely different than the first two Quake and Doom games. This game is really more Multiplayer based, although I'd rather play alone, since most people who play it online do nothing but write filthy words and insults instead of playing. But I find myself liking this game better than the new Quake 4. This one happens to contain several very fun mini games, like Capture the Flag, Team Arena (Must buy expansion from store), and Team Deathmatch, in which you're on a team of gladiators, all with the same color uniform.

The story to this game is basically just that an alien named Xaero likes to watch people kill each other so he captures all sorts of gladiators from all over the universe and puts them against each other in combat. The character you start with is Sarge, and I suspect he's the same Sarge from Doom 3. You also get to use Ranger, who was the character in Quake 1, and also the character from the original Doom, who's name is Doom. Basically the characters in this game comprise of soldiers, aliens, demons, and cyborgs, all of which come from the other Doom or Quake games, and a few I don't recognize. But I can't figure out why people keep comparing this game to Unreal Tournament. They're two totally different games and shouldn't be compared. This is a Quake game, and UT isn't. But all in all, I found this game incredibly fun. I've spent hours just playing through it multiple times.
