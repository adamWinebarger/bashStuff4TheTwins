Works exactly as advertised. Bought these along with a 2-pack of controllers for the GameCube, as my TV is a ways away from my couch and i wanted to play multi-player with my wife. The controller plugs into the extension cable about as snugly as the controller (and the other end of the extension cable) plugs into the GameCube, which is to say plenty snug enough to keep it in while moving the controller and cable around semi-violently, but not snug enough to keep a controller attached after being thrown across the room (just an example). One major concern I did have when I bough these was the possibility of lag due to the signal from the controller having to travel farther. This concern was unwarranted, as I have noticed no difference in response time either way. On durability, I've had these for almost 2 years and they haven't shown any noticeable signs of wear. Throw in a reasonable price ($4 when I bought it from Amermedia in 2012) and this is a heck of a deal for people that need a product like this. I would recommend.
