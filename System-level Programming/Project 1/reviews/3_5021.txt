Toy Story 2 is a good game.  It has it's fair share of mind-blowing colors and characters but its worthy of three stars only.  While I would say that the original story and the graphics are worthy of five stars, the gameplay is the problem.  This game is geared toward children and its cartoonish features and snappy music will appeal to them.  However, the controls are overly complicated for kids and the levels are frustrating more often than not (reminescent of A BUGS LIFE).  But then again, kids usually figure things out before adults so maybe I'm the problem...who knows.  Rent it first to see if you are interested in the purchase.
