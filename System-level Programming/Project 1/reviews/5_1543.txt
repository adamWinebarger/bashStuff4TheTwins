Even though this game is almost 4 years old-it is still one of the best games that the N64 has to offer.  Why?  Well dear reader I will tell you why.  SUPER MARIO 64 is a gaming revolution,  it was the game that everyone had to have.  It took Mario into a whole new atmosphere.  The world that is inside Princess Peach's(aka Princess Toadstool) castle is immense and highly imaginative.  Although the graphics may seem a little bit dated(it was a launch game remember that) it is still a sight to see.  As far as play control goes, it is a bit difficult to get the hang of moving Mario around, but once you get used to it then controlling Mario is a breeze.  In fact it is some of the best playcontrol that a game has to offer.  The Super Mario 64 storyline is familiar to Mario fans but at the same time a touch refreshing.  Yes Peach is captured but she is being held prisnor in her own castle(in a picture in fact), and one of the funnest parts of the game is hanging out outside.  One of my problems is that Luigi is not in the game, in fact no mention of him is made either.  Nintendo should have left the Mario Party franchise alone and focused on creating a Super Mario 64 2, but alas they didn't.  So if you own a Nintendo 64 and don't have this title, or are thinking of buying a N64, then get Super Mario 64 because it is by far a true gaming experience.
