I really, really wanted to like this game, I loved the cover, and I loved the characters, and the personality of the protagonist, but the controls are not very good at all. When you push the analog stick back, the character just turns around and moves all over the place, and jumping on platforms is painful to say the least. I would have liked this game if the controls were not so finicky, but it did extremely poorly in that department. If the controls were bearable, I would have actually enjoyed the game.
