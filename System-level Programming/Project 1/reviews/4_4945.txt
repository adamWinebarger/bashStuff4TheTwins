This is an excellent game, but not one that you can really jump right into. It takes a lot of playing to get used to the (MANY) controls and commands.  Microprose was quite thourough and everything is pretty darn authentic.  If you've got the time and patience this game is very rewarding.......one downside, no joystick calibration?  or force feedback....otherwise excellent!
