This is a classic game that I come back to every now and again. The graphics are great and the content is really satisfying. But I do have a complaint of the actual difficulty of the game.

1st island - The easiest to beat if you have all of the different coloured gems. The hardest level here is Native Fortress.

2nd island - Slightly harder but still fun. The hardest level here is Sunset Vista.

3rd island - The most frustrating. I spent half an hour to beat Generator Room with Perfect and another half an hour with Toxic Waste. The hardest level here is Slippery Climb.

I don't get why a kid's game can get difficult to beat. I mean, I own mature games like Jak 2 and Oblivion and they are a whole lot easier by comparison. If you are looking for a challenging game, this is your cup of tea. But if you want a kid's game that you can just glide through, I recommend Spyro.
