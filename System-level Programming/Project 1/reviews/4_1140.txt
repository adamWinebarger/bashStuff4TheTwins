I got this game in '97 and it is still fun to play. Unlike the original Mario Kart for the SNES or the new Mario Kart Super Circuit for the GBA (both of these games you have to use a control pad to drive)you can use the control stick on the N64 controller ot drive your go-kart which is a hundred times easier than a control pad. The game is easy in the begining, but it hets much harder as you get closer to finishing it. The graphics are spectacular, and so is the music. In one course you can go off roading and drive around and look at Princess Toadstool's castle form Super Mario 64! The tracks are cleverly designed and all to often you'll find yourselft barely winning or completing a race. The game does offer a good challenge with eight drivers to choose from which onclude the following and their speed: Mario average, Luigi average, Peach average, Toad fast, Yoshi fast, Donkey Kong slow, Wario slow, Bowser slow. The speeds come to play in the later levels where only Toad and Yoshi are your best bet for first place. Again with the GBA and the Gamecube (which launched today as I am writing this) Mario Kart 64 is a must have for N64 owners who can't get the Gamecube or the GBA for now. Also each character has his or her own course and the game has race and battle multiplayer modes where in the battle mode each racer has three balloons arround his or her go-kart and everyone has to try to knock out everyones balloons. Have fun!
