After having pretty bad luck with trilogies (see Twisted Metal 3), I was somewhat wary about renting Resident Evil 3.  I mean, how could they top a  classic like Resident Evil 2?  And that's where RE3 is hurt - it's  overshadowed by it's perfect predecessor and to do anything but copy it  would be less than perfection.  Given all this, Resident Evil 3 is still a  fun and very scary game.  The "fork-in-the-road" choices you have  to make are fun and give the game tons of longevity, as what choices you  make change the course of the game.  The puzzles can be frustrating and  drawn out.  Resident Evil 3 is basically Resident Evil 2 with none of the  bad points, but missing some of the good points.  The infinate ink  cartridge is definately welcome in my book.  Nemesis is an incredibly scary  character.  The thing that I was disappointed in was the lack of actual  story or any real characterization.  There was nothing really added to the  storyline that we didn't already know.  It was basically just solving  puzzles, fighting Nemesis 10,000 times and the big ending.  Given all this,  Resident Evil 3 is still a fun game that will keep you on the edge of your  seat and playing well into the morning hours.  Oh yeah, and the bonus game  is pretty fun!
