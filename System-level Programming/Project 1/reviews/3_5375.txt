This is probably closer to 3 and a half beuse of a few nice features, such as the loading screen is a stained glass that fills in. But the actual game has a really easy campain and really hard skirmish. There are may different units for each different player. You pay for everything with mana that recharges depenting on the number of loadstones and divine loadstones that you place.  I would recommend buying it because of the cheap price.
