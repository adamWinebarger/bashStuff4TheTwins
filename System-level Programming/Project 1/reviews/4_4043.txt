It's interesting to note, now that Diablo II has come out, how many of the improvements Darkstone incorporated into the Diablo play model are now found in Diablo II. Darkstone has a "previously visited  locations" menu that allows you to reduce the tedium of having to  navigate a lot of area you've cleaned out already; Diablo II has  "waypoints". Darkstone had extra skills which you could customize  classes with, as does Diablo II. Darkstone had a populated wilderness area,  as does Diablo II.
Darkstone gives you two characters, one of which will  contribute to battles when you're controlling the other, it can be a fun  game for a younger child (who wouldn't be able to play Diablo). Even if he  can't click fast enough to kill the monsters, he'll have backup. Also, the  shops use pictures of items, which means a child who can't read or is just  learning can still play, if he knows his numbers. The game generally seems  less spooky and bloody.
With all due respect to T. Byrl, the voice  acting is a bit strained, though not the worst we've heard.
The quests  pile up a lot more quickly than in Diablo, as well. It's difficult to get  through the first two villages without being accosted by half-a-dozen  villagers needing tasks performed. That keeps things moving  along.
Overall, the game seems a =lot= easier than Diablo. Spells cost  less, gold is more plentiful, magical items easier to come by, resurrection  spells allow one surviving character to bring bacak one that just died,  etc. etc. etc. And you have to worry less about moving in combat rather  than attacking, as would happen in Diablo quite a bit.
But the combat's a  bit mushy relative to Diablo--a little too automatic feeling, perhaps,  which is the only thing that keeps me from giving it the five stars. I  killed the first "boss", losing one of my own characters, before  I knew what happened. But then I could just resurrect him.
Overall, a  worthwhile contribution to the genre.
