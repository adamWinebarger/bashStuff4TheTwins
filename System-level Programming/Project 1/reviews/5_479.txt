This was the very 2nd one I played,part 3 as the 1st. Its nice seeing the younger versions of the characters and the events leading up to Tekken 7. Yes,SEVEN IS YET TO ARRIVE as of this review!!! Anyway....Easy mode is still hard by the time you reach the 7th fighter. The music is awesome especially King's. You can set the music to Arranged or Arcade. A great set of moves to learn so hop to it and buy it.
