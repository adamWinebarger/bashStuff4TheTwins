Why is everyone upset with this game? I'm not sure, but I'm not one of them. I guess everyone expected alot more than the original Total Annihilation and what they got was something designed a little better. Maybe a little too pretty. Here is what the game has going for it. Excellent detail to the each unit, building, and the surrounding terrain. A good story. Units with special attack features and some of these are really cool. The gameplay is pretty good also. The on-line gaming at boneyards. This is where the game really excels and is probably more competitive. What could've been better? The soundtrack wasn't very good. There was too much quietness when playing. And in some of the battles, the only way in was a narrow passage where only 2 units could stand side by side. the computer would just pack this passage way and it would take forever to get in (it took me over 7 hours on 2 such battles towards the end of the game). I would probably rate this closer to 3 1/2 stars, but I did enjoy this game. Lots of different characters and some pretty good battles.
