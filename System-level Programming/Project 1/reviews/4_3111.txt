I never got the chance to play this growing up. I finally went out to buy it to see what all the hype was about, and it took me back to memory lane. I love the soundtrack, and love the overall interactive design. The interaction factor can keep you engaged. The story was always weird to me, and felt like patchwork, but now that I am older and wiser, I can make sense out of it now. After playing through this recently, I can saw that for its time, it may have been seen as the greatest ever, but I have a few grips I don't like about it. Yet, still it is good game! I played Crisis Core first, so next will be Dirge of Cerebus. To any fan or newcomer to Final Fantasy, such as myself, I highly recommend this game, but you will have to set aside alot of time to get the most out of it.
