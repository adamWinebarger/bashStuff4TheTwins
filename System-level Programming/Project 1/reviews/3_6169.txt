The graphics on Q3 seems to be slightly (reads very, very slightly; asymptotically so) superior than UT, but that is where the positive comparisons for Q3 stops.  UT's map is a lot more creative (including such  settings as a moving train, underwater base, and an old wooden ship), and  the variety of options other than deathmatch (capture the flag, assult,  etc.) puts Q3 to shame.  Other than the nice upgrade in sound and graphics,  Q3 is just same ole.
If you appreciate long lasting playability and can  only buy one game in this genre, UT, I submitt, should be your choice.
