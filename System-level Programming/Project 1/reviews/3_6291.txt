Everyone kept telling me that this one was the best FF ever. Well, I disagree. I actively disliked most of the characters. The goals are not well explained, nor the means to achieving those goals. The Graphics are only good when compared to earlier installments in the saga. The sound is terrible. I couldn't get into the storyline. I was fairly irritated by how long the game took to get into anything like gameplay. If I wanted a tutorial, couldn't I have asked instead of being forcefed every 3 steps? I'm going to try to struggle through the rest of the game, but for my money, you'd do better with IX or X.
