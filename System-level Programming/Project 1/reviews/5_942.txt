I am writing this review from what i thought of it before red alert 2 came out.  this is a great game with a pretty good story line, though it lacks graphics.  Westwood online (the multiplayer sever) is also very good.  if your lookign to buy a good RTS i recomend red alert 2, but if you don't want to spend the money on RA@ this is still a great game.
