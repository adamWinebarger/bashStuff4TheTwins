This game has great graphics, an excellent 16-bit redo of the original soundtrack, and an overall awesome game. But after the famous title sequence ended and the game started, I was left in frustration. Level one put me against thousands of dinosaurs, scorpions, and worms. After 30 unsuccessful minutes, I used the flawed Game Genie ram editor to give myself invincibility, and level 1 became a snap. Level two started. I was put in mode 7 with a land speeder, not good considering the age of the game. The clunky land speeder vehicle could hardly aim at the Jawas, and once I shot all 10 of them I zoomed towards the sand crawler. Level 3 begins. It was an awful platformer with enemies that knock you back to the ground. Luke can't even jump high enough to reach half the platforms. Even with the Genie granting my wishes, it was still an impossible mess!!!
