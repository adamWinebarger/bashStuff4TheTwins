When this game first came out i did not have a snes so i had to watch my friend down the road play it and i never got to spoiled. Well its about 20 years later and i am about to beat it and am pretty disappointed. The game is way to easy I played it for like one week at nights and Im already to Gannon. I played the first one right before link to the past and it took much longer and was much more satisfying exploring and beating the dungeons even though graphically inferior. A link to the past is a beautiful looking and sounding snes game but there just not enough to explore and its to easy especially the puzzles so easy. I cant believe im done with the game I pretty much don't even feel like going ahead and finishing off gannon. I would recommend links awakening on the gameboy and gameboy color way better game in every aspect its how link to the past should have ben.
