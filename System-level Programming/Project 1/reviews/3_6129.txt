Quake III Arena is a first person shooter, Unlike the first two quake games it is a single player deathmatch game with AI players and ofcourse a really good multiplayer deathmatches. Quake3 has the best graphics i have ever seen in a computer game, Environments look breathtaking, Charecters look really great and the multiplayer maps design is excellent. Sure there are very few orginal weapons but the weapon detail is superb, The firing makes us forget we have already tried them before and the way they shine after picking up the quad-damage is really beautifull. The single player gameplay is good enough to tell players who have never experianced an online or lan deathmatch "This is how a multiplayer deathmatches experiance would be", with an excellent single player deathmatch with AI players. But sadely it is not that much fun for players who have played online or lan multiplayer deathmatches. Quake3 has the best multiplayer deathmatch ever, There is not a single dull moment as you keep seeking and destroying your friends or enemies before they get you. Finally a quake game not having a great single player experiance is ok, But i hope Doom 3 has a great single player gameplay and not just a Doom 3 Arena. Quake III Arena is not that disappointing, It has great graphics and an excellent multiplayer deathmatch and that what gamers expect from a quake game.
