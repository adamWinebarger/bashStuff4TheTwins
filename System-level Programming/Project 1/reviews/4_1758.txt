This games is one of those few titles where stealth killing is actualy fun. Tenchu had competant graphics for the time, though ugly by 2012 standards. The controls definately had issues but lets face it, this is the best Tenchu game to date. Tenchu has not alway done well as a franchise but this has its charming moments. Years later, the thing that sticks out most to me is the Soundtrack. There are certain games you hang onto for the BGM's. This is one of those games. The over the top stealth kill and trying to unlock certain items is well and good but the music is the thing that always calls me back. This games wonky graphics and play controls were never anything to write home about and only got worse with each consequential sequal and retread. The first one is the best in the series, in my opinion. Priority was never graphics or packaging. It was all about the fun.. and lovely soundtrack.
