Who in their right mind thought using up on the D-pad for accelerate was a good idea? Little things like this absolutely take all the fun out of the game. The vehicles move around like they're on a tightrope trying not to lose control and cornering and braking are deplorable and is a complete mess. Graphics hardly mean anything to me, but man does this game look harsh, probably the worst for the PS1, even for its time. This game hasn't aged well at all. It has almost put me off on trying the sequels, but I hear they get better. I tried, I really did, but it's way too short and the controller quirks along with the vehicle mechanics make this game almost a chore to play today.
