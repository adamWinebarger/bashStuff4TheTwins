When people play a Final Fantasy game they expect several things to come out of the finished game!  For one thing a great story, great charicters, cool battle system, drama, comedy, and greatness, cool graphics, and overall a great game!  That said and done Final Fantasy VIII is the worst example of how to make a great RPG!  When a great RPG company like Squaresoft, who been making the best RPG's for years now, comes in and makes a game, people expect it to be great!!!  Esspecally if it's a Final Fantasy game!  Well let me tell you that Final Fantasy VIII is anyting BUT a great RPG!!!  In fact this game is so pooryly thought out I am at a loss of words!  I'm sure you've already herd complaints about the complicated battle system, cumcumber (And glitched) plot, and lack of charicter developement!  So I'll spare you the details for once!  Lets just say Final Fantasy VIII not only gives the Final Fantasy series a bad name, but it also gives RPG's as a whole a bad name!  Thank you.  Have a nice day!
