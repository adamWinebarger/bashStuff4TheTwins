This is a really cool game. I played this to death i don't know how many times, sometimes alone and at times with a partner.
It's really tragic if you don't have this game when you own an N64, you don't know what you're  missing out on.
Um...well, this game is pretty easy and you don't really  need a strategy guidebook for this one. I think the only reason why it's so  damn fun is because on every track and race, you can race it differently.  You can try new tricks or even attempt to create your own shortcut-if you  are that good!
Graphics-wise, it's all a let-down, i was expecting  realistic models but i got cartoony characters, but then again- it's mario  and friends, right?
As a mario fan- you'll want to have this in your  hands and if you're not- then play this as a party game. It beats Mario  Party in replay value but is somewhat less challenging.
So bottomline-  it's a little too easy. But that will not prevent it from being a top 100  game of all time (read EGM #100)....
