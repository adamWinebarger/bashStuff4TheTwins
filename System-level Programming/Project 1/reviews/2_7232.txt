As others have mentioned, this product has serious flaws--especially with regard to the pitiful number of questions available.  For me, however, a larger complaint is the surprising unfaithfulness to the show.
The  so-called "Fastest Finger" questions are nothing really like  those on the show.  You don't compete to put the answers in the right  order; you just buzz in when the computer flashes up the proper  arrangement.  It's related to the set of skills necessary on the real  show--but it's not the same.
Likewise, when answering questions in the  "hot seat", you don't really get the "Is that your final  answer?" prompting in a consistent way.  Only some of the questions  allow for it.
Also, the questions in the pre-$1000 range are unusually  difficult, compared with the show. There, they're ridiculously easy,  complete with flatly idiotic possible answers.  Here, by contrast, the  early questions are much more serious.  They're still comparatively easy,  but they're not the gimmes they are on the real show.
Hopefully, the  producers will have found a way to be more faithful to the show--and give  us more questions--for the second edition of this game.
