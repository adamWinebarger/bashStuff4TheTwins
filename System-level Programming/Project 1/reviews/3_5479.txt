I searched out this game after I read up on it a bit. "Genuinely scary... suspenseful atmosherics... disturbing..." screamed the fan-sites.  For starters, if you've ever played a Resident Evil game, this is too familiar territory. There are differences yes, but once you set foot in the school or hospital areas, it's RE all over again (running about in frustration opening doors, checking the map every 5 seconds, puzzles accompanyed by daft poetry riddles etc.) The other thing that sounded good to me were the nasties. The sites again babbled on about "sinister zombie children that brandish kitchen knives and scream with glee as the slash you with them"... errr.. hello? They appear to be teddy bears with spikey claws that just seem to fall in front of you gnawing at your shoes! The rest are all RE moonlighters - zombie dogs, giant spiders, giant moths... nothing origional or vaguely creepy. The game's most interesting point to me is the 'alternate reality' sections with are rang in with a strange air raid siren. Basically what happens is that all your familiar surroundings are given a very Hellraiser-esque makeover, all bloody chains, crucified corpses and rusted metal. But it's really just the backdrops that feel creepy, the monsters patrol around with the same stupidity as ever.  The monsters also cause a radio transmitter to crackle so that you know when you're not alone, but that kind of ruins any jumpy moments as you just stand there waiting for any would-be attackers to reveal themselves. Also, the crackle gets annoying after a while. Anyway, buy this if you're not familiar with Resident Evil, as it's far to familiar. Actually no, buy RE 2 or 3 instead.
