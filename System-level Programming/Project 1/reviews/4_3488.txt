Capcom continues to make great fighting games, but this time out with Power Stone they create something special.  Power Stone was one of the first Dreamcast games out for the Dreamcast and helped make the system worth buying.  You can go anywhere, grab anything, and then beat the hell out of your opponent.  Its a great game, the only problem is that there is so much going on during the game you can lose your concentration at times, but thats the only flaw.  Otherwise, its a great game.
