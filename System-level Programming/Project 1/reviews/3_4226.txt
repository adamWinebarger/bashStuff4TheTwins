I've probably seen all of them from the WWII era, from the old 1942 Pacific air war to IL-2 Sturmovik.  This is one of the most entertaining.  It flies pretty well and the graphics are almost as good as some of the later ones.  It has given me a lot of pleasure.

I rank the best ones as follows: IL-2 (Sturmovik); Janes WWII Fighters; Microsoft's Combat Flight Simulator 2 (Pacific Theater); Microsoft's Flight Simulator (WWII Europe Series); and finally this one:  European Air War,by Microprose.

My ranking is based on quality of graphics, smoothness of manuever with a good computer (mine is a 1.8 Ghz Gateway Pentium 4 with a half-gig of RAM and ATI) and the flight modelingof the aircraft (how close to the real aircraft they are in their performance).  My judgment on the latter is based on the fact that I have flown a variety of real prop driven aircraft since I soloed in 1946, as well as many radio-controlled models.
