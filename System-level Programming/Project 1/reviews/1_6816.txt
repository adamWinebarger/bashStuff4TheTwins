I'm giving 1 star because this is one of the cheapest packages I have ever bought, it looks like a pirated copy! No, wait, a pirated copy would look better!!
All the disks came in a single case, onve over the other (which caused scratches in almost all of them),
Oh and all the cool covers on the disks? horrible black and white labels!
I regret buying this!
