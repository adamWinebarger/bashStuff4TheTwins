I think the game play is great the music was good but the main thing that made me give this a low rating are none other than the lacking of the graphics they are absolutely horrible and it makes it really hard to see where you going sometimes.

Well thats all I got to say, This game would have been great if it weren't for the attrocious graphics and I think the PC version was alot better.
