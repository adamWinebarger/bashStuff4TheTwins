If you like racing games that are unique, this is for you. You can race by yourself, or with a friend. Not only that, but you can also challenge your friends in battle mode with some really fun arenas. If your more of a solo player like me, don't worry, there are four different tournaments that you can play.

You can even use different items either to slow down the other racers, or to help you pass them up. Of course every item has it's own effects, there are a few that are hard to get. That's because they're special, learn how to use them, and the competition will be eating your dust.

And last, but far from least, there is a special mode you can unlock for an even bigger challenge. Yeah, this game will keep you busy no matter how you play. It's definately a must-have, order it while you can.
