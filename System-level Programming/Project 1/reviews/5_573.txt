this game lacked the ability to live up to name "Tomb Raider" its more of a "City Raider" half the levels deal with city-time scenery. and 80% of the enemies are humans. more like a 007 than a Tomb Raider - but the game play is fun in the cities (Venice) so i cant complain too much - just wasn't feelin the whole China scene. I liked to level skip those. and the twist at the end was a lil boost - so all in all ill give it 5stars - but it lacked challenge for me - i beat it in a week. just run around and jump for the most part.
