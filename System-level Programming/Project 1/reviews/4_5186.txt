I noticed a previous reviewer said you really need a fast system to play BZ2. Well I am playing on a 300mhz pent2, 160 megs ram, Voodoo3 3000, and with a 40kbs internet connection speed and it is smooth as silk with every  feature turned up and using 800X600 res. He must have alot of stuff running  in the background. Well enough of that. The single player game has great  graphics and good strategy gameplay. I find the storyline a bit weak  though. The multiplayer portion needs some work. Ping times are extremely  high and it is hard to get into a low(sub 400) ping room. They really need  to fix that portion. While I am not quite as impressed as with the first,  BZ2 is still a good game to keep you glued to your monitor for hours.
