THIS GAME WAS GREAT. THOUGH IT DOESN'T COMPARE TO ITS ORIGINAL ARCADE MACHINE, THIS HOME VERSION IS NICE ANYWAY. THE FIGHTS ARE ALL FUN, THE GRAPHICS STILL LOOK FANTASTIC EVEN THOUGH THIS GAME IS NEARLY A DECADE OLD NOW, AND THE CHARACTERS ARE ALL GOOD AND THE STORYLINES ARE ALL INTERESTING. TO UNLOCK THE BOSSES [WHICH IS THE MAIN THING], YOU HAVE TO BEAT THEM ALL WITH THEIR ALREADY AVAILABLE COUNTERPARTS. THE FIRST TIME YOU BEAT HEIHACHI [WHICH IS THE MAIN BOSS FOR THIS GAME], YOU GET HIM UNLOCKED. BUT THE REST OF THEM, YOU HAVE TO PLAY AS THE COUNTERPARTS TO GET THEIR BOSSES. EVEN WITH THE PLAYSTATION 2 AND X BOX AND STATE OF THE ART SYSTEMS LIKE THAT ON THE MARKET, MANY OF THE GAMES THEY PUT OUT TODAY CAN'T COMPARE TO CLASSIC GAMES LIKE THIS! THIS IS ONE OF THE ALL-TIME GREATEST FIGHTING GAMES EVER AND I DARE SAY THIS MIGHT BE THE BEST OF THE TEKKEN SERIES. EVEN HAS GREAT MUSIC.
