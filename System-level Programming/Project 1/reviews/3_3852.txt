This system has good graphics, but it was released between the time of ps and ps2. Sega whould have waiting  a year. While they do that, they should have upgraded the system. Therefore, this system was not in the competition of gcn, xbox, and ps2. nothing more to say... its a disapointment that i bought this piece of junk for the price of 3 ps1 which is way better. there are only 20 games for this thing. im sure NEVER gonna buy any sega consoles ever.
