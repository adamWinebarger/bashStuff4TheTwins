For those of you who have not played the Tekken game series, it is a 3D fighting game; that uses the same button configuration as Street Fighter 2 (Fierce Kick, Medium Kick, Weak Kick). What makes Tekken different from other fighting games are the moves, smooth animations and the cinematic movies for each character that is used to beat the game (you also get a new fighter when you beat the game), however that becomes the point of the game, seeing these movies. Each movie unravels part of a mystery (as to why your even playing the game). A person can beat the game in 20 minutes, because each fight only lasts about 20 seconds, so the pace is pretty fast and you don't need experience to beat the game. Unfortunately there is not much noticeably different from Tekken 2.
