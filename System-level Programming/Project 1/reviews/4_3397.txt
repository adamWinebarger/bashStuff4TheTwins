This was a very addictive game, with lots of fun involved. When I first saw this game, I thought it would reek, because the fighting scenes aren't great. But this game is a lot more than just fighting, it's an awesome RPG, maybe one of the best. Some of the bad language is not needed, but it's easy to look past that.
 One thing that really bugged me was that in some parts it was just too hard, and you could walk around for hours and not figure out what you were supposed to do. But other than that it was great.  You can actually play arcade games inside this game, and there is even a place where you can shoot some hoops! There is a big mix inside this, you can drive a motorcycle, a chocobo :}, and some hover crafts. This game is really fun, and has I think about 50 hours of gameplay on three different discs, so go out and get yours today!
