Well there's a lot of ways this game could have been fun, IF only they had tried to put more into it, ok it says on the front box that you can chose from 4 different types of parks, In reality all the parks are the same,  just different animation, they all have a feris wheel, flying bird thing,  ect... The little talking advisor cannonball in the corner is insanely  inoying, and yet they make it so that you HAVE to have him to play the  game, other wise you'll not be able to get to problems in time. I mean are  programers IDIOTS?  Do they think that a little cannonball making bad  jokes and talking in the most annoying voice you have ever heard is what we  really want to have as an advisor? And why do they animate the kids and  everything in the cut sceens so unrealistic and stupid looking? In almost  every game programers feel that they need to make humans look as stupid as  possible, why? Its not funny, it demotes the animators intelegence. Anyways  the only thing thats really good about it is that you can ride your own  roller coasters, and you can turn the little cannonball guy off!  Although it will be harder to manage without him.
