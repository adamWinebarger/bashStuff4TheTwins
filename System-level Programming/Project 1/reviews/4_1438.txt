Yes, I did find this a bit cumbersome. I wanted a more puzzle oridented game. I kept getting stuck in seemingly absurd situations and go to a walk-through forum to make progress. One of the comforts is that a cheat code can take you to the next level, if you get frustrated through not being able to figure out some trick to advance. Lara is a great character. But in this game she is faced with too many obstacles and impossible-to-discover secrets to make the game truly enjoyable.
