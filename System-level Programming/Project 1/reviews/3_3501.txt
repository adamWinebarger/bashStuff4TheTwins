Acclaim Sport's release of Attitude revolutionized the way wrestling games look and sound. The WWF Superstars' faces and bodies were scanned with stunng accuracy and detail. Along with visuals, each competitor's theme music and (partial) entrance was added as well. Collision errors and long loading aside, this game is something else. However, the controls were less than responsive. Acclaim used the Mortal Kombat button combos for each set of moves and, to be frank, it was a like Chris Beniot, a pain in the neck.
