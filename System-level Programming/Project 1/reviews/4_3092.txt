I remember getting this game and being blown away! The aliens, the gore, the raunchy bad @$$ hero Duke Nukem...AWESOME!

Ofcourse now we have Call of Duty, Battlefield, Dead Space, etc... But if you are wanting a vintage gem pick up this game!  I stayed up countless nights with friends playing through the game in co-op mode and facing off with each other in team death match.  Solo player itself was quite challenging, and still is.  I have always felt this game sort of set the stage for FPS along with Perfect Dark and Golden Eye.

Bad points:  It can be irritating because it is so challenging.  Also, there are a lot of extremely dark areas of maps that make it hard to see (maybe even impossible).  At the time of its release I thought the graphics were great, but now that I play through it again, they are kind of disappointing.  I mean, still decent for the time but considering similar games that were on the 64...they could have done a bit better.

Good points: Weapons are awesome.  SMGs, plasma canon that evaporates everything in its path, pipe bombs, shrink ray allowing you to crush your enemy, expand ray that enlarges them until they explode...HA just coolness.  Combat boosts were always a neat item that I wish had been in more games.  You can also aquire a jetpack, Vitamin X, holoduke to confuse enemies, dumdum (explosive) pistol rounds, and many other helpful items.

Fairly smart enemies and a wide variety of aliens.  Challenging bosses as well.

A lot of objectives on each map.  Rescue the hidden "babes", find keycards, solve lock puzzles, even crush toilets and drink the water to regain health.  And you get a good number of maps too!

I would suggest picking this game up, you get a lot of play time out of it.  Its a good blast from the past for us who miss the N64 on occassion.
