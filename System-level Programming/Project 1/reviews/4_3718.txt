Resident Evil 3: Nemesis adds a nice touch to the Resident Evil formula. Not only do you have to deal with oncoming hordes of zombies, but now you have another worry...being chased by a Nemesis that will come after you no matter what you do to try and stop it. The addition of Nemesis made this game one of the most enjoyable, and my favorite of the Resident Evil\'s. The addition to now be able to walk up stairs without pressing a button really did help way back when, though wondering how that was ever not a feature in the games is a bit of a puzzlement. And on the subject of puzzles, the only flaw this game has is the \"water puzzle\" near the end of the game. Only because it is totally random. Meaning you can get lucky and solve it in 20 seconds, or it could take about 30 minutes to beat. But other than that, this is a great game that any Resident Evil fan should have in their collection.
