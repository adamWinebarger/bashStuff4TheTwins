I bought one of these back when the N64 was still a modern console, and I just bought another one on Amazon. Obviously, I think this product is pretty adequate since I bought two of them. But here's some additional detail:

Pros: The bundle comes with both a rumble pak and a controller pak (or memory card). How cool is that? If you're buying stuff off of Amazon, it saves you about four dollars in shipping fees. What's better is how cheap the Tremor Pak Plus is now. If you snoop around, you can get this bundle new for the price you'd pay for a either individual product by itself!

As for the actual rumbling, it works pretty awesomely. I've tried it out on Perfect Dark and Madden 99 so far. It's got high and low settings. True N64 players use high for maximum vibration! :)

The memory card is the same size as the controller pak Nintendo originally made. Alas, it is not bundled with some of the larger memory cards that InterAct produced. But most games will easily fit onto the 123-page card.

Cons: The Tremor Pak Plus is both larger and heavier than the Rumble Pak produced by Nintendo, not to mention the original Tremor Pak produced by InterAct. This is because it has an additional slot to stick a memory card into the Tremor Pak. Presumably, InterAct thought people would like it, since it allowed them to use a controller pak and a rumble pak at the same time. Nice thought on their part, but the original Tremor Pak is, as a consequence, much sleeker and even more desirable than this improved version.

In summation, I sort of wish Interact had just given us a bundle with the original Tremor Pak and a 123-page memory card, as opposed to this bulky contraption with a slot. Even so, I'd totally recommend this bundle to anyone whose interested in the gracefully aged console that is the N64.
