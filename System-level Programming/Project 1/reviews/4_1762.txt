This is a great stealth game and one of the first I ever played (besides Metal Gear Solid). I spent many hours on this just being sneaky. The main thing I liked about this is that it's not your typical run around hack and slash game. You actually had to think about what you're doing and what the outcome would be. The voice acting wasn't that great but it was at the time when this came out. I think most people's problem with this game (myself included) was the annoying camera angle at time but once you got used to it, it wasn't that bad. Definately a classic game in my book.
