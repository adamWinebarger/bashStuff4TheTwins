I love F-Zero on the SNES and I was anxiously trying to get my hands on a copy of this version. And finally when I did I am very disappointed. the graphics are crap, the 3D polygons have no detail and the background is the same every time. Why can't there be a car that has all A+ categories, even if it's next to impossible to unlock, why couldn't they make the superior machine?

The race hardly goes fast enough. The only 2 tracks I did like where the ones with a tube pipe thing you drive on, like driving the outside of a tube, not the inside. And another track that had quite a few leaps and jumps... but over all, I still would rather be playing the original and best on the SNES. They should have included the SNES version on the 64 cartridge as a side game or something.

Overall:
Graphics: 3/10
Sound: 5/10
Controls: 9/10

This game might be better on multiplayer, but even a tho I have now unlocked every car and track up to the X round. I do have 30 days to return it if I don't want it, and I think I will be returning it. It's a rental game; tho you may not be able to rent them from too many places anymore, it makes me feel better that it will be out of my hair and I won't have it collecting dust rather then be going to someone else who might enjoy it more then I did.

I thought they would have learned from the SNES version, that the game needs a cheat for infinite turbo boosts... that doesn't require a game-shark.
