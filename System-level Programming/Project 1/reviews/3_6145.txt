The improvements of the graphics are very good, quake engines are always constructed well in sounds and graphics, being a reason of buying a new graphic card most of the time.  But this time, in terms of playability, it wasn't quite a succes for Quake.  I don't have any complaints about the lack of the single player mode, I play quake multiplayer most of the time.  Bots are ok, if you want to play in single.  The problem is quake 3 turns out to be a game that rookies have more advantage.  It is easier to frag than quake and quake II, and I don't get the same quake pleasure I used to get.  It is not a bad game.  Even a good one for somebody new to multiplayer first person shooters, but for an experienced player, it is a disillusionment.  I'll continue to play quake2 and counterstrike, but when I'm in need of some more blood, it is still a good game.
