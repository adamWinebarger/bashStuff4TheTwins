See, the Problem with this game is the choppy frame rate, the less then average graphics, and the poorly control system. They contribute to this game sucking compaired to its Arcade predicessor, If you want Daytona USA on your Sega Saturn, Pick up Championship Circuit Edition, It has 2 extra tracks, more cars, better graphics, 3D controller support, New soundtrack, better frame rate with less frame skip and the tracks are actualy labeled ;)

Overall, this game was a shameful port but not completely terrible, it goes for about 5 bucks so its worth the money. but if you have 5 more dollars pick up Daytona USA CCE.
