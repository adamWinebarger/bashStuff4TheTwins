Oca rina of time brings back fond memories. my brother & I both beat the game. The graphics still hold up well
today and puts present games to shame. It may be the greatest videogame ever created, who knows? You can
freely explore the landscape, the difficulty level is just right. There's no need for a strategy guide, if you're clever &
smart. Zelda even puts the Super Mario games to shame in my opinion. I don't have my N64 any more so I'd download
it on my WII VC, better than paying those ridiculous prices on Amazon, only fools & sheep would pay that much for
an old video game. It only costs you $11.00 for the WII VC version, so do the math, fools! I've been a Zelda fan since
the 1st Zelda on the NES, Shigeru Miyamoto is the greatest video game designer of all time, he should be in the
Video Game Hall of Fame. Zelda influenced the action/rpg genre, even to this day. Even Sony made a Zelda clone
game called "Dark Cloud", remember that game? But anyway, if you haven't played OOT, do yourself a favor and
buy an actual copy or download from WII VC.
