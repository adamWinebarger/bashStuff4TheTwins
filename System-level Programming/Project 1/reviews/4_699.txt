Rainbow Six really brought me into computer gaming. Before I never played games on computers. Now that I've played and owned this I play this and Rogue Spear, (the sequal), all the time. The game really brought a new  setting to all gamers. Your free in the enviroment, the action is intense  and challenging, the terrorists are out and dangerous. Everything is  perfect. It's like your there. The game has great graphics and non-stop  action. It's intense and you sit on the edge of your seat the whole time.  The weapons in this game don't have the great collection like Rogue Spear  does, but once your in the setting your weapons don't matter that much. If  you like first person shooters or any swat team type of games than you'll  like this. It's a classic. BUY IT!
