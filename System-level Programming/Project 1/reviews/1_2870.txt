Defective product---... Microsoft made these sticks back in the olden days when computers had game ports. They stopped making these and then brought them back into production. But by that time the computers no longer came with game ports so they supplied this stick with a UBS adapter (that is unique to this product- no standard UBS adapter will work). The seller did not include this adapter in the box and claimed that I was lying when I flied a complaint with Amazon..... In the end he sent me a UBS adapter that was made to fix some of these problems with these older devices but that did not work. So I returned the product.. He  told me to send it back to him ( when a product Is defective the merchant is required to pay return shipping but he did not want to do that) and he would pay for the shipping when he got it back. He did not do that and then told Amazon that the adaptor was in the box.... well yes, the third party adapter was in the box, the one that he sent me in an attempt to solve the problem.
