Mario Kart 64 is one of that games that is hard to find, but that effort has a very good reward, 'cuz this is one o'that games that began the real 4-player madness (you know...), it's also considered as one of the best Mario Kart games ever (better than Mario Kart: Double Dash!!, and maybe as good as Mario Kart Wii). The only thing that I didn't give the 5/5 is that this game is a bit tedious. Yes, I know that graphics... forget about the graphics, 'cuz first, it's the N64, and second, graphics are not important in this game that focus on fun. If you have a 64, and you don't have already MK64, you must find it now! Everybody with a 64 must have this crazy great game! (don't forget four controllers for the real madness).
