Don't buy this for very young ones because it will be too hard for them. When Croc runs it's very sencitive so when you tap left Croc will do a full turn. You will die because health is limited but you will get used to this if you're truely talented at games. My first game was Crash Bandicoot 1(back in 97/98)and on my first go I could control the character with ease and I beat my friends at games when they had a Playstation for 2 years. My point is if you've a son/daughter and they've got a simular story and they're talented at games then get this after Croc 1 and I know adults will enjoy this as well.
I don't think Croc 3 wasn't released because Croc 2 was rubbish.
If you like this checkout Crash Bandicoot 1/2/3.
