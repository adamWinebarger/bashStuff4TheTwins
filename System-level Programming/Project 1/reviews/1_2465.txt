A 60FPS original Xbox game locked to 30FPS, with missing 480P support. As opposed to every other version, the US and JP PS2 port has support for switching the voice track between ENG or JPN. Choosing JPN helps massively with the cringeworthy ENG voices, but this hardly makes it a better game. It begins easy, then ends up slippery and borderline unfair in no time. You're essentially playing the same line of stages in the same order, with different missions per character. Also, the camera system has been completely screwed over by the porters. Honestly, this and Unleashed are great examples of 3D games in the series that are worse than '06. At least the framerate is stable...
