Ages in the making and a bit of a disappointment, 'Mechwarrior 3' isn't sufficiently different to the ancient, venerable 'Mechwarrior 2', and suffers from the lumbering nature of mech-to-mech combat - even the best simulation of big, slow robots fighting each other boils down to a series of largely static duels. It's not complex enough for there to be a strategy hook, and not cartoony enough to be fun on a visceral level. Fittingly for a sequel to one of the nicest-looking games of 1994, the presentation is excellent, although the fantastic music from the original game has been ditched in favour of some anonymous, inferior imitations. As before, the weapons you have are an odd bunch - although you can kit your mech out with a variety of equipment, you eventually realise that only heavy lasers and heat sinks are any use. Machine-guns and missiles are strangely ineffective, and it seems unsatisfying to spend the entire game 'painting' the legs of enemy mechs with weedy lasers. Despite a four-year wait, the game seems... underwhelming. Not bad as such, just very forgettable. There aren't many missions, and only one of them (in which you have to intercept a train) presents a major challenge, and when its over it just seems to fade from the mind. Except for the voice acting, which is fine, but having them say 'aff!' as a salutation, whilst true to the Battletech universe, sounds extremely camp. The intro movie is fantastic, by the way.
