If you loved Resident Evil 1 and 2 you will love Dino Crisis. Bult with the same operating engine as the RE games this classic sci-fi horror survival adventure keeps you excited while dodging raptors and scrounging for ammo.
Be careful not to bleed out!... Seriously though, not just a joke but an extremely annoying game mechanic.
