I bought this game yesterday because I wanted the nostalga of mortal kombat.  I was very unimpressed with MK:DA on XBOX so I bought this game.  The store only had this game on Playstation and not N64 which I what I wish they had.
I took this game home dusted off my Playstation and popped this game in. Almost immediately I remembered how cheap and chessy these game can get.  I had no problem getting to the bosses but once you get to Motaro and Shao Khan, the only way you can win is with luck and not skill.  They both do the same chessy move over and over and over and over again, and there is nothing you can do about it.  If you try to do a move, the computer's apparant pshychic ability counters your move before you even do it; very lame programming.  They also added a throw to Shao Khan's already cheesy arsenal which makes him even more cheap. This game is better when playing other human players, ...  It takes more luck than skill to beat this game.  Another drawback is the slow loading times on Playstation.  ...  These slow loading times and also slow loading times during Shang Tsung's morphs's helped me remember why I hated playstation so much and stopped playing it in the first place.
