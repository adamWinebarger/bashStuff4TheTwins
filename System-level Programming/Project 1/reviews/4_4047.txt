Whoa! I have never seen such a fast-paced game like this one! After playing the demo on the Sega Dreamcast generator disk I decided to try to find this and after playing for about 3 hours I was definently satisfied with it. Being a long time fan of Sonic (Sonic the Hedgehog 1, 2, and 3, Sonic and Knuckles, Sonic 3-D Blast) I was looking forward to this Dreamcast title. The graphics are absolutely amazing, the music is great and the action is fast, furious and entertaining. However, I have to deduct a star for the occasional camera angle which somtimes interfered with gameplay. Besides that, this game is a keeper for all Dreamcast owners. Get this along with it's awesome sequel Sonic Adventure 2 ASAP!
