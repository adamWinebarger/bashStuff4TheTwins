This game is very very good, because it has the real-life thinking, it runs on slow computers, like mine, it doesn't that that much space up, and it's fun too. The only probalm with this game is the money, there isn't any free-for-all levels, which makes it less-addidive, there are lots of things to do, completing parks takes too long, and too hard though. (The money)
There is hunger, Thirst, Happyness, Nausa, and Bathroom, I like to rise the money for bathroom a lot, so people after it hits really high, they have to go. The downside to this game is, even if you make a great park, if your people have to pay everytime they go on a ride, they get broke, and leave, or get mad, trying to find there way out (This happened to me) so just make park enternce 60 dollars, and everything free. (even food) What my 2nd favorite thing to do in the game is, make roller costers that stack on each other, you can make a roller by just ONE land by.... Rising the land first, not too high though, then get a roller coster picked, the put the first roller coster path on the high land you made, and build on! You can make lots of stuff, in a small area! Graphics, ok, this is good, but nothing like what today is, plus, people can get stuck on Water Rides, for no reasons, and it isn't perceft on making a good life like roller coster because parts show on and off, Graphics:4/10 Fun, this game is the MOST addidive game ever! Fun:9.5/10 Gameplay, this can last you, like 100+ hours Gameplay:10/10 Sound, this is a bad thing in the game, like only the sound of kids and roller costers, needs SOUND:5/10 Overall, this game is great, if you like fun games, get this:8/10 which is Great, and 4 stars goes to Roller Coster Tycoon!
