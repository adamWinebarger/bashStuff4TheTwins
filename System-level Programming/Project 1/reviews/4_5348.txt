This game brought back a lot of fun memories that I had as a kid. The only thing I can say is that you will have a hard time playing this if you do not have a playstation controller with an analog stick. The controls are EXTREMELY difficult. I'm not sure if im just used to the modern age stuff or if the controls are supposed to be like that. Anyway good luck.
