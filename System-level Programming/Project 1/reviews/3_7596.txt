same as the other one but with a few glaring differences like the graphics stink like a butt on this one.theres a lot of characters in this one.theres robots,cops,martial artists,gods.......really theres only 2 types. 1-the kind that get beat down by the computer almost every time and 2-the kind you can win with all the time prettily easily through massive repition.they are lou kang,raiden and the cop.theres some male ballerina looking dude with a lot of flaming balls.......errr i mean fire balls.hes pretty good except for the whole spandex thing.its alright but 4 is way way better.im actualy suprised they're even from the same system considering 3 looks like a sega master system game.for all you bozos out there the sega master system came out after the intellivision and before the original nintendo.oh yeah,i don't appreciate the guys who made this making shiva a chick when in fact shiva is a very powerful hindu god with enough destructive capacity in his 3rd eye to destroy existence!
