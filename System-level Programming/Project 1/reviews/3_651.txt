Okay, I normally love everything Lucas Arts puts out, but this...

I really, honestly loathed this game! The gameplay was repetitive, hard, and booring. Basically, it is every vehicular battle from the trilogy, put on a game.

While this had great potential, and awesome graphics, I cannot reccomend it.
