When I first got Sim Theme Park, I thought it would be a great game. A week later, it got very boring. Unlike Roller Coaster Tycoon, everything is very expensive! A trash can, for example, costs $100! In Roller Coaster Tycoon, a trash can costs $3! Also, there's this advisor that shouldn't have been so picky! He'll say your janitors' patrol areas aren't just perfect, or one person just littered! Big deal! Again, unlike RCT, it has only four themes; one per park. I also don't like the idea of Golden Tickets and Golden Keys, which you need to access other parks. It's really hard to get things just perfect, and since everything is expensive and you can't charge for rides, your cash balance is low all of the time until five years later (in game time). You don't have a very large selection of rides, especially at the start. Overall, this game really bites the dust, and if you don't have Roller Coaster Tycoon yet, get that instead.
