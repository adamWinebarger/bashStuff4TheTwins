Just so you know, I am only going to discuss single-player version because I never tried multi-player.
You have Warcraft, you have Diablo, and then you have Starcraft.  Diablo and Warcraft have gone off to have #2 (and in Warcraft's case, #3) but Starcraft has nothing but a Brood War expansion.  I can't see why.
Starcraft is fantastic.  You have three different races that are unique in their own way.  Different buildings, different units, different ways of evolving... heck, just about everything is different between each race.  I think that is pretty cool.
I, personally, like the custom scenarios.  I also like a really cool scenario that is kind of like a arcade game where you try to protect your nexus (protoss main building) from oncoming enemies.  and get 'galactic heroes' if you survive.
I found the actual campaign a bit too difficult for me, with some missions seeming just plain impossible.  It also takes a while to master each race (I like the protoss, but the Zerg are, in my opinion, the easiest to fight with)  But it is still fun and I really like some of the heroes, especially the Protoss heroes.
Finally, I like making my own scenarios.  It seemed difficult and a little confusing at first, but I eventually got the hang of it.
Go out and buy this game!
