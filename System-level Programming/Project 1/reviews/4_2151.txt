It can be said that this game is easy, maybe the graphics is terrible but at the time i loved this game i've not touch this game in years however i can say i really enjoyed this all time classic.
For the people who are true nitendo fans this is a classic that you can add to your 64 libary. I still have my 64 and it works great so does the games, Starfox is worth a try laterz folks.
