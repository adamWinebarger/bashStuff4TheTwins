First of all, Here are the PROS and CONS

PROS:

Good for the people who own a SNES, not PC.

CONS:

really bad graphics.

slower animation than PC.

you can't save the game.

It is shorter than the PC version of doom.

Overall: 0.9

This is a pretty good game, but not for SNES!

Get it on PC. That version is alot better.
