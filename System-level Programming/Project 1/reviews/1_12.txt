I've bought and played ALL of the ANNO games since 1602, and spent more hours than I can even count building massive empires with extremely complex trade routes. I was thrilled to see another installment released, but I absolutely will NOT pay for something that limits my hardware changes and installs.

Wake up UBI, look at all of your other software title reviews, both here on Amazon and on gaming sites. People are not as stupid as you think, and will simply find a different game to fill their time with and throw their money at if their freedoms are inhibited by your software.

By adding DRM you've actually promoted the use of piracy instead of reduced it, because those that really do want to play it will find a way.
