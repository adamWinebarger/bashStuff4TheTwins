If you liked Mario Kart for the Super Nintendo, then you will love Mario Kart 64.
This is an amazing game. One of the best for the 64. If you have competition around you can take up hours of play time.
I have played this game almost as much as I have Golden Eye 64, but not quite as much. If you are looking for a good quality game with a very high replay value then this is a great game to check out.
Doesn't matter if you are 10 or 70 you can get into this game. The multi-player makes things a little bit more interesting. The battle mode is the best feature if you have equal level competition.
