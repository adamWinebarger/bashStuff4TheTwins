Mario Kart 64 Launched with the N64 and it sure did good with the sales but Ultimatley this is disapointing.  Mario Kart Succeds in graphics departure but Fails at the boring over and over gameplay that you indure in the game.  Don't get me wrong this is a great game but it just pretty much fail to fun factor.  Back when I got this game when It first came out I simply loved it but after the next day it kind of got boring for me.  The game is great but fails with the overuse of boring driving and nothing exciting happens.  If it were up to me I would have addes some really cool Driving maze level(yeah it does sound lame but what ever)

In Graphics the game is simply superb.  It really does make the N64 a really good lookin' system.  The level desighning and great setups make it one of the better looking N64 back in the days when it was still popular..  It truly does make some Ps games look like crap.

The sound is pretty average...ehh I rather not go into that..

NOW.......The gameplay..

It just get's boring after awhile and nothing special happens and the single player is pretty short.  But cool......

And that's pretty much it.

The Multiplayer is pretty fun.  I had a blast playing it with my friends.  It really is fun but like I said before...Nothing special.

When it all comes down to this.  The boring yet kind of fun gameplay, Great Graphics but doesn't help gameplay, Really fun MP but still fails to succeed in fun factor(well atleast to me)

I give Mario Kart 64 a 3.4 stars out of 5

Lates..
