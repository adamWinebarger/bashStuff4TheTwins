This is a more than ok game. Not the best,but good. If you like the "Spyro" series,you'll like this for sure. The gameplay, control,sound,etc. are all like the first 2. The only problem is it's EASY.Really,really easy. The levels are about 5 minutes long each,and the total gameplay span is about 7 hours. But still, thats better than it being hard. It's still pretty fun and stays true to the first 2. And Crash's little sister premires in it. Here's the review:
Graphics:4/5
Sound:5/5
Music:3/5
Fun:4/5
Control:
D-pad:3/5
Analog:5/5
Overall:4/5
