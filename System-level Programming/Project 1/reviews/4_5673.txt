I have enjoyed this game very much. It's fun and exciting and the story is a big step up from the previous games. Graphics wise, this game has a few improvements added but otherwise it's similiar to 2 & 3.
  Problems include glitches; falling through walls and losing saves, in fact that is the only thing keeping me from finishing the game. The rope swinging is also a problem. It's hard getting it to swing as is aiming.
Graphics: 8/10
Sound: 8/10
Control: 7/10
Fun: 9/10
