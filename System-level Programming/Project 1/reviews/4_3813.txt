The Dreamcast, when it came out, was the best system available. Even today, it can still hold its own against most consoles. The problem that doomed the Dreamcast was timing.

Usually, and we see it even today, consoles come out in groups - SNES/Genesis, PlayStation/N64, the PS2/Gamecube/XBox, PS3/Wii/XBox 360. The Dreamcast came between the PS1/N64 wave and the PS2/GC/XBox wave. Casual gamers had just shelled out money for the previous generation, and the more savvy ones were saving up for the next. Developers held off making Dreamcast games, so when the next generation did come out the Dreamcast had a lack of titles and less-advanced tech, dooming it.

That said, the Dreamcast is a good console. The controllers look weird but actually sit well in the hands, and I like that the DC has four ports off the shelf. The console is also fairly compact. Plus, for its lack of titles, it had some really good ones: the original Soul Calibur, Shenmue, Skies of Arcadia and Grandia II come to mind.
