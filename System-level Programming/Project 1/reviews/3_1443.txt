Have you ever sat for hours playing one particular video game and you can never find out what to do? This is one of those games. Although it does hold a great assortment of fun weapons and great graphics, but it's hard.  You don't just go around firing guns at everything. Although I did not like  the first Tomb Raider either, only because many of the enviroments looked  exactly the same though. They both are good games but if your not willing  to put a lot of time into video games and just play for fun like me, your  not going to like this one.
