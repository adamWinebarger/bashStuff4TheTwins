NBA 2K is not the best basketball game for the DC.  NBA 2K1 is better.  2K1, ..., you can play network games; has more players including classic players; better moves and controls; no more not catching a pass or passing the ball to someone out of bounds; no more crazy camera angle changes that sometimes cause you a turnover b/c you walked backcourt, etc.  But NBA 2K is a great game.  It's better than EA sports or anyother Bball games out there.  The graphic is excellent, controls are easy to use and simple, and playing against the computer is a good challenge.  It's quite addictive because it takes a little time to become good.  So, most likely, you will lose to the computer at first, even with the best team.  Don't get discouraged, you will become better and so will your players (really). ....
