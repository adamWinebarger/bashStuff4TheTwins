This game takes months to get 100% completion. The new feature in this is getting time rellicks(by doing level fast)and swimming. In Crash 1 you get Balders after you sometimes, in Crash 3 you get a dinosaur, I prefered being chased by a balder and when it squashed Crash it went into the screen but you don't get it in this.
BUY this if you want a platformer(after Crash 1 and 2).
