I think it's too late to give a review on this game, but here goes. This is the most perverted game ever made. When you think about it, it's pretty disgusting. "Aim for the open spot!", "I'll do you fast, Peppy old pal.", "Fox, get this guy off me!" "I've got a present for ya!" EEEEEEEEEUUU! Should kids be playing these games?
Anyway, the gameplay is fun...for 15 minutes. Then it's bothersome, annoying, and dull. Your team mates have the worst A.I. ever, and they don't get power-ups. The game is horribly easy and WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYY too short. Like, 30 minutes short. Also, the voice acting sucks.
I hope Starfox Adventures will be good. This game shouldn't have started the whole Starfox thing. If so, it needed work.
