The Kings Quest series are probably the most memorable adventure games in  existance.  They appeal to children, adults, men, and women alike.  The  games are serious, slapstick, romantic, dashing, and so many other things  all rolled into one.  I really loved this series and I'm glad that someone  decided to package them.
Each game follows a member of the Daventry  family in one manner or another.  As an added bonys, girls.. sometimes the  hero is actually a heroine!  As the series progress you can watch the  Daventry family grow, have children, and suffer tradgedy through at least  three generations.
The only thing that might be a problem is that as some  of these games are old they might not work on newer machines.  Make sure  that you have all the patches from Sierra and read the documentation  thoroughly in case the games don't function your first try.  With a little  bit of computer coaxing you should get them going again, but you also might  decide it's not worth the trouble.
