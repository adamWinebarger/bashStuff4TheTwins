it was fun finding the differences in the pictures, but it got boring when the same pictures kept comming up. it would have been better NOT to have a time limit on these games.  that just makes it harder and frustrating for beginners like me.  i am handicapped and disabled and don't move that fast.  also i just turned 61, so i'm not that fast mentally either.  there should be an option to choose if you want it to be timed or not.  there should be that option on ALL games.
