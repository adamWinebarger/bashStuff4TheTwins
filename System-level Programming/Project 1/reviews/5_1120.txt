This is one of the best and my personal favorites from the Zelda franchise! The story was fantastic, the gameplay was amazing for the time, even compared to todays gaming this game showed less problems or glitches.

There was hardly any serious problems with this game. The playtime was a very good length and it offered a some side quests to do. Each dungeon was well constructed and were not something you walk in and leave unhappy. Some parts were frustrating sure but when is a game just so easy and you feel happy beating it?

Puzzles in this game were I suppose challenging for  child but they were not impossible. This is a great game for all ages and a great buy as well.
