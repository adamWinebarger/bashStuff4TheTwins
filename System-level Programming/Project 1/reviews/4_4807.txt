Don't get me wrong: I enjoyed this game from front to back. It has graphics that, while not amazing, you won't be confused about anything visually. The sound, however, should be award winning. It is simply magnififcent and gives you the feel of combat (when the combat music is playing, of course).
BUT: This game has bugs. One really bad one I found is when i was making a trade (this is a easy thing to do, and will happen often). I paid a lot of gold and stuff for some crossbowmen, and I never got them. It has only happened to me two times.
The game features a quest pack, but I don't find it fun. They expect you to win against dozens of creatures and evil guys and God knows what else, while you control, at best six or seven creatures.
The Lords of Magic part, however, is much better. You control one of 8 'Faiths', each with different creatures, buildings, and spells. Some of them are much better off than others: the weaker faiths have many more allies. The stronger faiths tend to have more enimies. Two Faiths, Fire and Choas, start out with only one ally, which is each other(two other faiths view them as neutral).
No matter what you do, your opposite faith and the Death faith start out powerful. This adds a new challenge to the game (The Death faith is out to kill everyone).
So, this game has good graphics, sound, and completly different gameplay. It does have bugs, but they won't ruin it for you. You should check out this game. Now, I'm going to go play a game that you, for whatever strange reason you have, still have to purchase...
