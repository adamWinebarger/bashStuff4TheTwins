This game is OK but not near as good as FF9. FF9 has better graphics. The characters look like dolls. The cut scenes have good graphics. If you want this game get it for a cheap price or get FF9. If your a big Final Fantasy buy it but if not I don't think you should get it. I think you should buy FF9 instead.
