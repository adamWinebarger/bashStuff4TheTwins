I was really looking forward to trying this game so I was pretty disappointed when I played it.  The controls on this game are terrible as is the camera angle.  There's a very brief tutorial at the beginning of the game but I didn't find it very helpful.  You're given a briefing on what you're supposed to do and what your goals are but I didn't find that helpful either.  This is one game that I would not recommend to anyone.
