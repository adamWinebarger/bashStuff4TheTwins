Well this game features some of the best graphics Ive ever seen and its easier to learn how to play than Rogue Leader but what were they thinking when they decided not to have a save option?N64 is a superior machine so its not like it doesnt have enough memory to support a save option and even old games like Metroid and The Legend Of Zelda let you save your progress with a password. This game is just like one of those arcade games at movie theatres because its fun to play for a while but pointless to try and beat it because it just doesnt let you save. The new Star Fox game for Game Cube sure as hell better have a save option.
