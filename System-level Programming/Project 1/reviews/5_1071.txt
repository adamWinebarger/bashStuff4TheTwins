I bought Mario Kart 64 for my nephew for his birthday. I played Mario Kart 64 when I was a little and I loved it. My nephew already has Mario Kart DS and he loves it. I figure that he will love this game too. Mario Kart 64 has many different levels in which you can race other Mario characters such as Luigi, Wario, Donkey Kong, Bowser and many others. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes any of the newer Mario Kart games.
