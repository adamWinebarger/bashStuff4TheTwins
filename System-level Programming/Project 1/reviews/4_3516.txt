[Baio Hazard] series have the most popularity in Japan. Especially Code Veronica is one of the most favorite thing. Because it game is  very real gurafic game used the spec of Dream Cast ability very well. Even if it is now time that there are more great spec hard, PS2, XBOX etc, you can play the came with the joy and the satisfication.
Vaio series is ,if I say to that simply, a active horror and action game. The main character of the game collect many weapons and curing items etc , you defeat the monsters that get to be stronger and storonger as story advance. The weapon is real too. For instance, the sound of the bullets, gravity feeling when the character have his gums at the ready...
When you use your bullets, there is fun that you consider the remaining bullets. And the sound is the horror sound. The monster are horror too.
