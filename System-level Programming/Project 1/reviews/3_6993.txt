It's a LOT like the first game, which was great, but I would have preferred it if we had been given more technologies to research. All the discovery seems to be over a bit too quick before each game boils down to the standard 'smash the enemy to pieces' part. In this respect it became quite repetitive, especially when you consider how long it takes to get a good game going. The only alternative is to try out different civilizations, and only then it's just the architecture that's different.

I do like this game a lot but I just wish for a bit more diversity and more surprises in the next one (as in&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Age-of-Empires-III/dp/B004LFX8FY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Age of Empires III</a>, not&nbsp;<a data-hook="product-link-linked" class="a-link-normal" href="/Age-Of-Mythology/dp/B000J14PBA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8">Age Of Mythology</a>). I've not played the expansion pack yet but if it gives us more to work with then I'll definitely check it out.
