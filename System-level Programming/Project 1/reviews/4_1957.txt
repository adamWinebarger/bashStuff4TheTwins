"Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back" was a large step up from the first part. This game's graphics, music, gameplay, and even story were much better than in the first. But it's kind of weird how Crash Bandicoot doesn't end up staying with Tawna Bandicoot and instead ends up living with his little sister, Coco Bandicoot. Well, at least Coco has the ability to speak, unlike her big brother. The voice acting changed dramatically as well, and for the better(Dr. Neo Cortex's new voice was much cooler and evil-sounding). If you liked the first Crash game, get this one. Although it's more difficult(especially in gathering Crystals and Gems), it's really fun!
