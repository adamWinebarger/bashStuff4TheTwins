I went through my old Video games, weeding out those destined for trade in at Bookman's.  I saw this one and remembered liking it, so I threw it back in and played it through.  I forgot how much fun this game was and highly recommend a re-try to those FPS freak out there.  I mean, you can get this game dirt cheap now, and it is a total blast!!!

My only beef is, you have to play it through in order to use the cheat available and many of us play a game once and that's it.

Other than that, not a single complaint.  This game freaking rocks!  Tons of different monsters/foes, tons of cool weapons, level upon level of varying backgrounds.  Too me back to the old days of all the Doom games.

So, if you're feeling nostalgic and want to play an FSP that doesn't require you to evolve three extra fingers on each hand, dig this one back up or buy it dirt cheap here on Amazon.  You won't regret it.
