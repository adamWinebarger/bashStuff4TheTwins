I LOVED THIS GAME~
opening was good.........game play was good.
the only thing i did not like was part of the storyline.
IF you are as into the story line as i am .you KNOW that raziel was never in the first blood omen BUT in this game they said he was.( even placed him in the room with the orignal pillar people ( hehe )( you will know what i am talking about  when you play)
HE never had a pillar and he was never in the first one.
GUUUUUR
other then that the rest of the story line was very nice.
the ending made me want to cry as well....
with that aside i say YAH HOOO this game rocks. you need to rent it or buy it or get someone to play it for you.
