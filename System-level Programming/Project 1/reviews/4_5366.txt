Your trying to stop alien clones from taking over the world. yattta .. yatta.
There are 2 modes.  Adventure\Explore where you go through the complex looking for the ones responsible.  And the other is battle mode.
Battle mode is where it gets all my stars.  I love the selection of moves you learn.  The indepth way to accuratly take out your foe is impressive.  Every type of kick and punch, also up to 4(or was it 5) combos.  Holding moves(front and back).  Reversals, and lying down moves.
This is a fight feast galore.  With rping stats.  Many attributes to level up(arm,legs,etc).  In fact every move you use will level up and be stronger.
Good game, good story, nice sound effects.  People that bad mouth this game, either didn't give it enough time. Or just can't handle something orginal.  Or maybe the people that like this game are of a mold of a different gamer?
Bottomline: There is no game out there with more moves then this.
And with that, If you like fighting games and don't mind the rp syle battle mode then its difintely deserves to be in your game libary. I don't find the battle mode constricting or reduce the fun in anyway.
