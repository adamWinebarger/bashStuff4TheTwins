I own Rock Band 4 for Xbox One and I learned that you can add more vocals to tracks.  I saw that this was cheaply priced and has a high rate of success from other buyers.

though the mic does work, and had no problems with utilizing the tambourine my only real complaint is that the USB Cable length is too short when compared to my original Rock Band Mic (from RB1).

I fixed the problem by adding a usb extension cable to each mic.  This added an extra $5 cost per mic and gave me 3ft.  For 6ft it would have been a $5.50 increase and for 9ft, $5.80.  Even with the extensions you're still looking at a cost savings over the "Rock Band" mic of $10
