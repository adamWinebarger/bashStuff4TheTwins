This is an amazing oringal game that I purely enjoyed playing. The storyline is so original for its time and its graphics are amazing on wide screen tv's. In the game, you are Lara Croft, a tomb raider and have been given another opportunity to explore more for artifacts in Peru by Jacalene Natla, a millionaire investor who holds a dark secret. You soon realize she is not what she claims and you do undercover research and she betrays you. You travel thru the dark cold and abandoned caves of peru, ancient underground Greece, the catacombs of Egypt & Atlantis all to find 3 pieces of the scion for which Natla asked her to get, all while blasting out animals and creatures you wouldn't expect and collect secrets along the way. This is a great game that had a greater sequal. But this is my favorite out of the series. Original playstion graphics, great music and sound affects and great storyline!
