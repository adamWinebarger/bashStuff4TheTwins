Blue Stinger I think is a must own for anyone with a Dreamcast this game is an action game and a survival horror game the first time you complete this game is the best you can complete it many times but you already know whats going to happen Some bad things about this game are their is some annoying music you have to put up with and you end up killing the same mosters over and over again Their is so much more to say about this game but I'll let you figure them out buy this game
