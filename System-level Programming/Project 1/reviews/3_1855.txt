A decent ps1 classic but not really true 3d platformer like croc or mario64 of the same era. I never understood why crash is restrained to levels that are basically hallways, very linear, not much depth. Yes you still get '3d' movement but its restrained by limited levels so it almost 2.5 d in a sense. Graphically this was one of the noticably low polygon games that suffered from flickering and sometimes missing polygons on characters and levels. the 32 bit era polygon games have not aged well. Graphics suffer from texture warping, poly flickering and jaggies and it doesn't help that the ps1 had the worst video ram,system ram and resolution of that generation of systems. This has to be a very common game from the ps1 era, I cannot understand why people think its disc based version is worth north of 20. Hello people, wake up, there is a psn digital version for 5.99. Since when does a digital psn re release warrant a skyrocket in disc version prices. The value of a game should be based on rarity and a greatest hits game that has be re released digitally is anything but rare. Do yourself a favor don't pay more than 10-15 for the disc version anymore and your over paying. I see crazy prices on auction sites like 40 and above seriously is it worth it to pay 34.00 over to have a plastic disc.
