This was a great game that I enjoyed playing a lot. The point of the game is to raise a monster. You start with a low leveled monster, your goal is to make them learn different attacks and win money against other trainers in battles. This game is very similiar to Pokemon. The only thing I didn't like was after you raise a macho battle-ready monster that took hours to train, it dies. Anyway this game is a great game!!
