I thought id reviewed already, but here goes.  Not your typical ninja game, as most are stealth, this one is more the action side of things, tons of weapons, some special powers, projectiles, and level kind of puzzles. Think ol school brawlers (final fight) meets 3D as a ninja. Cool art to be seen but not cool enough to forget it takes awhile to load as you look at it (load screen).  Fast paced and fun, easy controls and cool lvl design. One other thing is graphics, moderate maybe for ps1, but just bad by todays standards when some ps1's still hold up better.  But that is overlookable as it doesn't hinder gameplay, and is so much fun to play, your just a bad azz ninja. In short bad grfx, long loads, but still so worth being this ninja.
