UNLIKE THE EARLIER MK GAMES, THIS ONE FEATURED SOME 3D GRAPHICS AND IT ALSO HAS WEAPONS WHICH ARE AVAILABLE TO USE OR THROW AT ANYTIME. THIS IS NOT AS GOOD AS THE NINTENDO 64 VERSION, BUT IT'S A GREAT FIGHTING GAME NONETHELESS AND I THINK IT'S BETTER THAN ANY OF THE MORTAL KOMBAT GAMES THAT'VE BEEN COMING OUT SINCE 1999. GREAT GRAPHICS, GREAT CONTROLS, AND A FUN PRACTICING MODE [WHICH YOU CAN FIGHT FOR HOURS IF YOU WANT TO WITH THE SAME OPPONENT!]. BUT UNFORTUNATELY AFTER THIS ONE, THE MORTAL KOMBAT FRANCHISE WENT COMPLETELY DOWNHILL.
