Luckily, I got my expansion pack with Donkey Kong 64,so I didn't have to spend 30 bucks for it. There is a significant difference with the 4 megabytes of extra video memory, but it's nothing revolutionary. However, because quality games like Donkey Kong and Perfect Dark require it, it must be purchased. There are also several games that don't require the expansion pack, but benefit from its use (Top Gear Overdrive, Rouge Squadron). The bottom line: if you're a 64 owner/player, you should probably buy the expansion pack.
