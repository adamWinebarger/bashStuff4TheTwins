I LOVED Theme Park and Theme Hospital, RCT is the best Sim game around so I had high hopes that Theme Park World (as its called in the UK) would go one step further.
Basically this is a kiddies game. Its NOTHING like  Theme Park and your very limited to what you can do. There are fun rides  and the best part is walking round the park and going on your rides but you  don't have the same amount of control as in RCT.
Its nice to look at  (although I didn't like the 3D style) and you need a good spec machine  otherwise expect jerkovision (or if you build too many rides). Theres only  4 parks/scenarios!  unlike RCT where there are loads plus an add on pack).  My nephew liked taking pictures of the park and emailing them but it has  taken a whole new view point into Sim games. This isn't a true Sim game  -  I think we need a bit of going back to basics here and seeing what makes a  Sim game. Just look at Theme Hospital and RCT. It also loses marks for  having the only online help assistant who is more annoying then the  MS-Office Paperclip one! (Luckily you can turn him off!)
I stopped  playing it after a week. So will true Sim Fans. Bring on another RCT add on  pack!
