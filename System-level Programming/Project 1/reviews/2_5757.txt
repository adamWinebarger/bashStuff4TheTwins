Well I bought this mainly cause I always liked the soundtrack from it and I thought it was cool that U could just slap it right into a cd player and listen to it. Like tomb raider 1, Loaded, etc Well with the greatest hits version, that's not possible. Not only is that not possible but it has a totally different soundtrack on it. I used PSXMC to listen to it. so never really liked the game because of the 2d style gameplay, definitely don't like it now since they change the soundtrack and stuff on it. Greatest Hits disk SUXS!! it did come with all the manuals, case, etc.
