Final Fantasy VIII was a beautiful game for the first Playstation. It has likeable characters and a good storyline, by video game standards. The thing is, the battle system is terrible. It's not fun to play (which is the whole point of video games), and the Guardian Forces (summoned monsters) scenes are cool the first few times, but take forever and can't be skipped.

Is realistic to expect Square/Enix to remake the title with a different battle system? Something more akin to FF X?
