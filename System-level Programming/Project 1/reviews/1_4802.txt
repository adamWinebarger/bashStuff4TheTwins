I know what you're thinking... I need another controller. The generic can't be that bad, I might not like it, but I'll be able to play.

No, you will not. You wll hate every minute of this.

As others have said, the buttons are actually ok, but the d-pad will drive you insane. Rage quit-inducing. Don't bother, go out to your local retro store and pick up an actual, old SNES controller. The price will be well worth it. I've pretty much thrown this in the garbage, but I can't seem to bring myself to it for some reason, but it deserves it.
