This is Konami's attempt at ripping off Namco's Ace Combat series.  Plain and simple.  Whoever was expecting Microsoft Flight Simulator really needs to buy a clue.  The Dreamcast is a game CONSOLE, people... not a PC.  There is simply no way to replicate the dozens of keyboard commands required to produce a realistic flight simulation.
What does the Dreamcast do best?  Correct: arcade games.  This is an arcade attempt at a flying game.  No take-offs, no landings, no aileron tweaks, no altimeter factoring, it is a plain, easy to understand, straightforward shoot-em-up in the sky.  Are the controls sluggish?  Yes.  Do the different planes really matter?  Not really.  Will you get any mileage out of the machine guns?  Probably not.  But this is all par for the course for the kind of game this is.
Sky Odyssey for PS2 is a much more fun and active flying game than this, but this is by no means chopped liver.  The graphics are often impressive, and the game does put up a fight in the later stages.  But as long as you aren't dumb enough to expect a NASA flight replicator, you might very well enjoy this little romp through the un-friendly skies.  Who knew terrorists would have the $$$ to own more jet fighters than most industrialized nations?
(p.s. How in the world does this game maintain a 4-star review rating average when I know for a fact that I read at least a dozen 1-star reviews?)
