Well i now have an xbox, which is grreat!! But i did have a DC and i have to say it was one of my fave consoles ever.  great graphics, it looks like Ps2 and it looks almost a little better than gamecube.  when i heard a while back that sega was ditching dreamcast, i was so mad, i wondered y because it was such a great console.  So, i think if you are someone out there who wants to play games that areen't up to date, but great, this is the system.  I think that someday, sega should jump back into the marketing and make dreamcast 2, with more power than ps2 or xbox, and come with dvd and net support.  It woulld be great!!
