From the ruins of Rome to the futuristic setting of Atlantis, Tomb Raider takes the gamer through a variety of wonderful worlds.  Unlike its sequels, it stays in the tombs and out of other settings.  I believe that it is one of the best games ever made, and it certainly is a classic.  However, I believe that its sequels in many aspects overshadow it.
The scenery in Tomb Raider is better than most games, although it is mostly cubed and flat.  The game play and plot are wonderful, and the graphics and sounds are acceptable.  However, the artificial intelligence enemies are less than intelligent, and the gamer is often left feeling underestimated with the ease of some of the puzzles.  Laura's moves are limited, and the weapons supply is less than perfect.
I would recommend this game to any fan of the Tomb Raider series and to the average gamer.  However, I do feel that other versions have better qualities.  Tomb Raider II offers wonderful AI and is perhaps the best for a gamer seeking combat. Tomb Raider III combines the better aspects of the previous two, and Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation offers the best plot and character mobility.  If you are looking to stay in the tombs, or if you are not into puzzles, stick with this game.  However, don't miss out on the other great qualities the Tomb Raider series offers.
