When I got this game I played it for about 2 days and decided it sucks.
Then after a couple of weeks I played it again because some friends said it was cool. I thought I should give it another chance and I played it with friends, but the game just doesn't appeal to me.
It's quake 1/2/3 for me! (even though 3 was a bit disappointing).
I don't get how everyone just seems to like UT.
This is the game that got me back to playing games that actually have a story.
