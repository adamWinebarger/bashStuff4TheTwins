This game is great!  It is very challenging though.  The graphics aren't great but they work for this game.  Die Hard Trilogy is better than the sequel because it is more fun to play through.  It will take you a long while though.  The game follows with the movies pretty good.  All the modes on the game are fun but the driving mode is the hardest.  You will definitely love this game. Yippee Ki Yay!
