This game is a classic, I first played it at the arcade around 1996, but the game came out around 94-95. Of course, you won't find beautiful visuals, this is piece of history, one of the first 3D fighting games ever created. It was groundbreaking for it's time, and to this day I still find it addictive.
Each character has a unique fighting style, and these styles keep getting inherited on every sequel, most noticeable Paul, Jack, Yoshimitsu and Law. The Playstation version actually expands the arcade version, adding ending movies and extra characters. There is an arcade version in Tekken 5 as part of the bonus arcade history games, Tekken 2 and 3 are also included.
If you enjoyed games like Rival Schools, Mortal Kombat 4 or Dead or Alive, you definately need to play this.
