Doom 64, ain't all that bad, But as for Me I wouldn't buy it.  I did rent it, And I enjoyed it for the time I rented it.  But, I think this would be one of them game's that get old in a week.  Doom 64, is a Shooting game. But, it does not have no Multi-player mode.  The are a lot of level's in the game, But one thing that I didn't like, is They all looked the same pretty much, Just with a better name.  The level's looked good, And 3-D. But, everyone and Everything in them, looked like it was paper glued on.  The best thing to do, Is Rent it for a week-end And, see how you like it.
