10/10, one of the best games ever released on any console. The story-line is amazing, it captivates you swiftly. The game-play is also awesome, and the graphics, evil bosses, etc., it's just one of the best games in the market. At some point, we all wished to become Link, play a tune or two with an Occarina, and may day turn into night, or draw towards you a horse named Epona.
