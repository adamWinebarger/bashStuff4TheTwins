Maximum vintage gameage!  This game is packed with the best (and worst?) of the arcade days.  First, there's Ms. Pac-Man...though this might be the Japanese version; the Midway one played differently.  Galaxian is the precursor to Galaga; maybe it should've been on Volume 1 instead?  Phozon is based on the atom principle--you collect the various atoms (with your X-shaped thingy) to form various shapes matching the one(s) in the background.  Dig Dug, also back, features that guy in a suit digging in the underground, collecting fruits/vegetables, and dropping rocks on (or blowing up) Pookas [little bouncing orange creatures with big eyes] and Fygars [basically small dragons].  Pole Position II is the sequel to Pole Position; this time you have your choice of 4 tracks to race on.  I didn't play Tower of Druaga much as I don't care for that game.  Don't forget, you can also check out knowledge/history of the games in the various Museum virtual rooms; there's even a stack of NG magazine covers in the Library!  If you were addicted in the early 1980s, get addicted again...only this time you don't need quarters to play!
