I played this so much when I was younger, I'm only 18 now, but I saw it on here and HAD to buy it. I basically went through the levels so fast, and kind of got bored, the game wasn't as interesting as I used to think it was. One thing is that I try going through it so fast that I end up falling in one place and get so frusterated I give up, but over all.. great game for kids or people who are easily entertained. I still play on occasion.
