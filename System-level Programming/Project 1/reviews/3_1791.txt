This was a Christmas gift from my grandmother and even though I like the game but to me it was a major step down to the first game.  The boss fight were a major disappointment mainly because of that stupid three hit rule.  N. Gin should've been the final boss not Dr. Neo Cortex.  The final boss fight against him is just a stupid race and you only have to hit him three lousy times.  He has a blaster and yet he never uses it.  The ending was a major downer because it falls horrible short.  The soundtrack is at least great but not as a good as the first games.  Tawna being dropped was a mistake because it made that whole adventure in the first game feel like it wasn't worth it.  I can't believe she dumped him shortly after he rescued her for Pinstripe.  He tried to kill Crash in order to keep him from rescuing her.  Now that is cold hearted.  Still is a good game but not as good as the first.
