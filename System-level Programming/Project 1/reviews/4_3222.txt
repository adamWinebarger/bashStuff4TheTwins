I found the only challenge to be the weapons and the final showdown with sephiroth. This was a great game but way to easy to play because i played Phantasy Star prior to this. On the other hand it had a slew of extra missions and hidden items and stuff to play for. Find the ribbons and sephiroth will be a lot easier to fight. I found two. The graphics were terrible, lets not lie ok... and to add insult to injury there was never a remake. In a way it makes me hate the game a bit more than i already do, even though it was a game i spent most my time with....
