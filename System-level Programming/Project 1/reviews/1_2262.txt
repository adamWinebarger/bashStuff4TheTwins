Okay I'm not totally lowbrow, I can get puzzles (I got near the end of this game called Lighthouse). I couldn't get this at all when I played it, not even a bit. You roam around this island getting fragmented information, and at least on the computer the puzzle hit-detection seemed weak, so trying to access the puzzles themselves even with a guide was a frustrating endeavor. The puzzles themselves were bad enough, but the fact that solving some of them didn't seem to change anything discernible (at least in the early stages of the game) meant I ultimately gave up in frustration.  Not to mention it wasn't even fun.

Instead of this, I'd recommend Okami or any other hybrid puzzle-rpg.  If you can't figure out the puzzle with the tools possessed, you can at least take out your frustrations on a hapless creature in battle.
