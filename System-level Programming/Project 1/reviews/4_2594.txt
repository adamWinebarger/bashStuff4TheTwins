This is a very fun game, possibly the best "racing game" I have played. I normally find them very dull, "Nascar 64 anyone?" However, as a racing game, I enjoyed this immensely.

Here is the flipside. This game is not NEAR as good as, say Hydro Thunder, or Need for Speed. The best thing about this game is the multiplayer, as the single player gets old fast.

My reccomendation, find a friend, rent the game, and have fun!
