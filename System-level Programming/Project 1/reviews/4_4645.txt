This game got me interested in the RTS genre all over again. It is  wonderful: full three dimensions of movement, a camera that's easy to use,  beautifully-rendered ships and an engrossing storyline. The only strikes  against it, in my view, are the near-identical ships of the playable races,  and the lack of variety in Homeworld multiplayer missions.
Still, this  game is the first of the 3D RTS genre (or at least, the first to do it with  any real style) and the yardstick by which all future comers will be  measured - it's still a wonderful game.
