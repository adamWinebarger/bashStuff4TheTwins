This game along with Mario 64 and Donkey Kong 64 basically use the same basic style with different characters. They are are a blast even now, though it takes playing it now to realize how clumsy the camera system on these games was. I don't know how I managed to get all the notes while playing on the N64, I find it next to impossible now to have the patience to navigate some of the last levels with the slowness and precision needed to prevent falling off a cliff and having to spend 5 minutes getting back up, or worse, dying, in which case you lose all your notes in the level and have to collect them from scratch.  Thus I  quicksave often.

I guess I no longer am as good as I once was at these games.  Still, this is one of my N64 favorites from my high school years basically.
