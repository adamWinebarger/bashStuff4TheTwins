I admit that I was one of those nailbiters waiting eargerly for Q3 to be released. When I got it running, I was more than a little unhappy with the single player mode. It is completely different than what you got from Q1  and Q2. In single player mode, you fight in.. well.. simulated deathmatches  with computer bots. Now, when I read this on the back I thought 'Gee.. What  a great idea.' Unfortunately, most of the bots act like what they are:  Computers. The scripting on these things is way too linear. Not to mention  that the difficulty settings are completely out of whack. The second to  hardest (hardcore) is almost impossible, even for a seasoned deathmatcher,  while the nightmare setting is absolutely impossible. My final complaint is  this. Why am I holding the same double barrel shotgun and rocket launcher  from all the other quakes? The game offers only 2 new weapons.. which is  sad.
Now, There are positive aspects of the game. The fun-factor of a 8  player human deathmatch is unbeatable. If you have the means to play in one  of these with Q3 you can expect all the fun as from the previous versions..  Of course, you will need a fast internet connection or a local area network  to do this.
All in all, Quake3 was.. Ok. It saddend and disappointed me  that the loss of a storyline did not produce life-like and enjoyable bots  in single player. However, mulitplayer is still a riot. You want a good  single player first person shooter? Get Soldier of fortune.. You will not  me disappointed.
