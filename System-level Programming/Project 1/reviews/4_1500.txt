What can I say? This game is fun and funny at the same time. From mario flying around with the magic caps to Mario burning his [...] cheeks on the hot lava, this game is great! My only problem with this game is the freakin camera angles!!! AHHHHH sometimes I feel like I could just kick the Lakitu that controls the thing! Angles sometimes get soooo akward that it makes it difficult to make a jump correctly..or so you won't go flying down to your death. Other than that I give it a 4. Would be 5 if the camera was better.
