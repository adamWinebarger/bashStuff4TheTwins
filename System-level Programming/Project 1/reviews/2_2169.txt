Although there are video games out there that can wow you, and then there are the duds. Not all racing games seem to be the best behind the wheel. In the case of a video game coming based from an arcade version, it really seems to be alright, but looks are always decieving. In the case of Nintendo 64, there are very few racing games that really can make it behind the wheel. This isn't really one of them.
The 1996 Crus'n U.S.A. game for Nintendo 64, seems to be a real miss behind the real wheel. The graphics are very strong, but you are limited down to a certain number of cars to choose from, which is seven, not like the more than dozen that there are in the arcade game. Although the courses seem to be within detail, there are so many flaws, including th frame rate and the style of the game, especially within the tunnels of place like Washington D.C. Nevertheless, the game seem to be a little down and out, but at the time it came out for Nintendo 64, it was one of only two video racing games for the Nintendo 64.
It is kind of dissapointing that they couldn't try to make some better video games with racing at the time, but there are so many better choices to the Nintendo 64. If you're really into the racing feel of the Nintendo 64, I suggest you either get Mario Kart 64, Rush 2, or the sequel to Crus'n U.S.A. : Crus'n World.
