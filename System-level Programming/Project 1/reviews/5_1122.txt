This game is pretty darn easy.  I beat most of the tracks with only a rental.  It's not near as tough as the SNES version.  Heck, the SNES version of Rainbow Road had no walls around the track and the track was thin to boot.  Rainbow Road is a cakewalk on this one.  Wide the whole way with walls all around.  Too darn easy.  However, there is a monster shortcut that's very dangerous to go for if you want to make things interesting.

Even though it was too easy, I bought the game anyway.  It's fun to beat the heck out of these computer controlled suckers.  Plus I really like the game's ending.

There is one hard level, the one with all of the traffic in the extra mode.  It can be very frustrating if you make a mistake, because you get run over again and again and again.  It usually takes away any hope of recovery.

The most significant improvement over the SNES version is the time trial mode.  You can race a ghost of yourself after you've already completed the course.  The ghost is only a recording of your previous performance, but it gives you a lot more motivation to beat your old time, I assure you.

I've never been into multiplayer modes, but if you're into that kind of thing, you'll REALLY love this game.  Some multiplayer matches can go on for a LONG time, since the levels are so well-designed.
