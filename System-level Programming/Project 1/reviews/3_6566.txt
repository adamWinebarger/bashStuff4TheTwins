Well after about 2 years of delays to get it right you'd think this game would be the greatest thing since sliced bread. Blizzard is one of those companies that I hold to a little higher standard. In my book, they have  fallen a little short. There are no glaring flaws with the game, but it  just isn't the next step I'd hoped it would be. Sure there are nice  additions  like a few more skills, being able to run, and a stash chest,  but it's the same depth lacking RPG the first one was just with a few  additions. Don't get me wrong, I'm not slamming the game. It is a very  DECENT game; it's just not a great game. If you like myself have been  burned out on Diablo for years and were hoping that DII could rekindle the  flame, I believe you are going to be disappointed. If you're looking for  some easy hop right in point, click, and slash action then this is for you.  If you're looking for Diablo but with more depth and more emmersive game  play, then you may want to pass it by. If I were on a limited budget and  needed a gaming fix, I'd look elsewhere first.
