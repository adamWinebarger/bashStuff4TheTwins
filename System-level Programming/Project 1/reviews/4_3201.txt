While this game may not be the very best RPG in my opinion, I must give this game credit for being able to finally throw the RPG genre into the mainstream for two gaming generations. This game was the first game in the series to feature stunning FMV with 3D character models in pre-rendered backgrounds, which was a major step up for the RPG world, considering that any RPG released before this one either only had 3D models during battle sequences or none at all, but of course graphics are not everything. Gameplay will always matter much more than the graphics in any game; it is the sole reason games are played, to enjoy the game itself with graphics just being an added bonus to the already great game itself.

This game still maintains the fast-paced ATB system where the characters must react in a timely manner to defeat the enemies or bosses that will cross paths with the characters controlled in the battles. One of the greatest highlights of this game is that this is the first game in the series to have a science fiction based plot otherwise unseen in earlier titles, and very few other RPGs at the time.
This game is also the first in the series to add character peripherals such as "materia". Materia can be equipped and can be made more powerful each time it is used.

Overall, I would highly recommend this title to advanced and beginners alike, as this game has a straightforward level up system with a neat addition of the character peripheral I have mentioned above. This should last one a good 50-70 hours, depending on whether one decides to undertake the various sidequests offered in the game or not.
