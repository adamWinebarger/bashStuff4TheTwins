Good gravy.  What was Squaresoft thinking when they made this one?!  It's terrible in almost every aspect.

First of all, the battle system involves having to siphon off magic spells from the enemies and grafting them into your abilities.  This means that if you use them, your skills actually decrease.  Not only that, but because the maximum level your characters can reach is 100 instead of 99, you're actually susceptible to the nervewracking "Level 5 Death" spell.

Secondly, the cast is shallow and characterless.  The main character is grumpy and unsociable, and this reviewer could not relate to him as a player should be able to.  Also, none of the other cast are very memorable, like the characters of the other Final Fantasy games.

Lastly, the story is about as intriguing and deep as a pile of... well, you get the idea.  The story begins all right, but then lapses into a nauseating, mismatched soap opera between the main character and his rival's ex.  Not only that, but the main character's attitude prevents the gamer from learning what the "villain" is really after; they never give you a deep enough look at her.

So, really, if you're a Final Fantasy fan, skip this one.  You didn't miss anything.
