Don't get me wrong, I'm an avid fan of the HM franchise! I do love the SNES version and so forth, BUT for some reason I can't seem to get attached to HM:64, I don't know if it's because it's so choppy, or if it's because the old 3D aspect at the time is just confusing. It seems like back then 3D graphics were just utterly confusing, thankfully now at least for the most part its fixed.

I do plan to go back and try it out, who knows maybe if I give it another go I may get attached and change my views. I'm willing to try anyway...

I'm more of a fan of the original HM, HM:STH, HM:AWL, HM:MM, HM:ToT, HM:AP, and so forth. HM: 64 just doesn't hold appeal to me, but who know that could change as I dive deeper into it.
