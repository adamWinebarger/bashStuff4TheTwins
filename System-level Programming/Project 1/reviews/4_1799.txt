This is perhaps my favorite arcade collection of all time. The PS1 Namco Museum series is a very interesting twist on the arcade compilation formula. The innovative things about these games is that you have the option of walking around in a literal Namco Museum, and there are doors which represent each game, whats awesome about walking around in the museum is that each door for each game you go into has excellent build-up and atmosphere to get you pumped to play the game, and since it is a museum, each game's room has a plethera of interesting history of Namco, for example, in the Dig Dug room, you can click on these action figures that are on display and they represent real toys that Namco actually produced. There are also these sort of tips and tricks scattered on the walls of each room, as well as more history other than merchandise. Its a brilliant idea, and luckily, this game has an amazing roster of games. It has Ms. Pacman, Dig Dug which is my favorite arcade game of all time, Galaxian, Pole Position 2, Tower of Druaga, and Phozon which is a really strange sort of puzzle game. Lastly, because of personal bias, this game means a lot to me. It introduced me to Namco and some arcade classics, and some of the museum locations invoked wonder and curiosity in me and they make me happy whenever I see them. One last thing to note, you do not need to walk through the museum, you can quick start a game if you want to.
