What the people who praise this POS software bundle don't tell you is that there hasn't been an update to download for over a year, and there probably won't ever be another one! The TRUTH is that it only runs a few games... None of which anywhere on par with a real PSX!
It's a complete waste of money unless your some techhead who wants to marvel at it's shortcomings! Get Conectix VGS if your looking for a Playstation emulator on PC! ...What good is 3d card capabilities if it doesn't run any games to begin with?
