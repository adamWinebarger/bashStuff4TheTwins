Man, I never knew Phil Regis could be this ANNOYING!  Since some of the first few questions are ludicrously hard (which is totally unlike the show), and it gives you 30 seconds to answer the question (which is ALSO  totally unlike the show), I have to restart the game A LOT, which means I  hear Phil Regis A LOT.  A "skip" button should've been put into  the game!  I haven't recieved any repeat questions after about 3 months of  owning the game.  How?  I uninstalled it after 30 minutes and never played  it again!  Trust me, you'd get more fun out of an electronic whoopee  cushion than this game...and it's $5 cheaper!
