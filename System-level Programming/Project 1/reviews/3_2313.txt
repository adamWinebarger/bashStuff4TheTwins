Before you freak out about the 3 stars let me just say that in my perspective this was a completely overrated product, waste of time and money. Only because I was told before I bought this expansion pak that it would make my 64 games look great and play better, also because i saw review videos comparing games with and without the expansion pak. I saw no difference in my games in any way. Yes, im also aware that certain games needed the expansion pak to work, but i own none of those specific games. Thank you.
