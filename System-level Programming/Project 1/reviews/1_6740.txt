Please hear me out. Let me try to explain why I gave this system such a low rating.

Had this console not been remembered as being fantastic and interesting, I would be giving it 3 stars. But, unfortunately, there really isn't anything very interesting about this console. The graphics aren't very good compared to the PSX or even some of the better stuff on the Saturn, like Panzer Dragoon Saga or Virtua Fighter 2, the Shenmue Saturn demo, Sega Rally, and Daytona Championship Circuit Edition, to name a few. Lots of games I've played have very low resolution textures, often sprawled out. The games themselves just aren't very interesting or fun to play, even in multiplayer.

I'm also not a huge fan of the controller. While it has an odd design, it is fairly comfortable, and the joystick is very precise.

Finally, there's the value. The games themselves are not at all worth the high prices they demand. Super Smash Brothers simply isn't as fun as Powerstone or Bushido Blade. Mario Kart 64 isn't as much fan as Ridge Racer Type 4 or Crash Team Racing. Mario Golf is nowhere near as good as Neo Turf Masters. Hell, even Mario isn't as fun as the Crash Bandicoot games. And just about all of the games listed (with the exception of Powerstone 1 or 2) are all marginally cheaper than their N64 competitors.

For the final verdict, this is a system I would recommend avoiding. The prices are far too high for their own good, and the games aren't good enough to justify the prices. If it hadn't been for the huge disappointment all the games I had brought me, this would have a higher rating.

Take off the rose tinted glasses people.
