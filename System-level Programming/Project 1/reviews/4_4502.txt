ROLLER COASTER TYCOON is a prime example that gameplay will get you a lot longer than shiny graphics ever will. The game may be technically infirior to THEME PARK, but RCT makes up for this with a much more addictive gameplay. In short: RCT is probably the most fun you'll ever have running a theme park on your PC.
