This game is fun to play, but the graphics are terrible.  The terrain is green, with some very sparsely placed trees and signs.  It is fun to beat down other racers with pipe, chain, hammer, etc... but the bikes are nearly impossible to control at full speed.  The expansion pack for the N64 is the biggest waste of money i've ever spent.  It does NOTHING to help the graphics or sound quality.  multi-player saves it from the graveyard.
