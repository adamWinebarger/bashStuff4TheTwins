This is just one of those titles that you pop in and expect to be taken back to a similar time. Eh, maybe not so much as you'd think. It's not a bad game by any means, but it is one of those early 3D games that just hasn't gotten the camera down quite yet. That, and Big the Cat.

Buy this game if you really want to go back down memory lane, but just remember to temper your enthusiasm
