Mario Kart 64 is an excellent game! I love the graphics, the creators at Nintendo 64 made them very specific. My favorite modes to play in are either Mario GP, because I love racing against the computer, or Battle, because you have to be alert and careful not to run into in obstacles like bananas or shells! I really like the "ghost" so you can see whether or not you beat your previous time with that course. My favorite course is Yoshi Valley because in many areas, there are no walls to keep you from falling, so it's a challenge, and I like the big squasher egg! The one thing that drives me crazy is the fact that the computer can manage to get in front of me while racing without me noticing or even knowing how they did it! Other than that, this is a great game with excellent graphics and fun for the whole family!! I hope you enjoyed my review!!
