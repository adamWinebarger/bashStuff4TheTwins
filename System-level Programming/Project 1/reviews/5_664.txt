This game is great for Star Wars fans! There are eleven single missions, but there are three bonus missions too. The first is a race on Tatooine where you fly a T-16 Skyhopper in a race against three of your squadron mates! The second is the Death Star Trench Run which the developers, in my opinion over did, because the trence is HUGE and it has to many turns. The best bonus level is the Battle of Hoth. The graphics and music are superd just like every other Lucasarts and Factor Five 5 game! Their are also secret vehicles. You can pilot the Naboo Starfighter by using a secret code (go to Lucasarts website!) the Millunium Falcon and the TIE Interceptor can be earned when you complete the game by getting all the gold medals. It doesn't take long to beat this game if your good at games like this, but ot does offer a pretty good challenge. Now go join the Rebellion and vaporize those TIE Fighters.
