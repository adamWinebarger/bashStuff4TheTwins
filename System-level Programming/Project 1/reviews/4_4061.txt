"Sonic Adventure" starts off easily, and it's easy to get the hang of.  However, it may be a little too easy.  There is a lack of puzzles, and the bosses are pretty simple.  I guess I'm the person that likes RPG's like Zelda and Grandia II.  The story is ho-hum, but once you get into it, the story really breaks off in different directions when you see the game through the eyes of the six characters you can play with.  That's the main reason I gave it four stars instead of two.  Also, the graphics and sound are good.  My only gripe about the sound is when characters are talking, their mouths speak Japanese, but they speak in English.  (That is if you have the language set on English.)  I'm not sure of this, but I AM sure that their oral movements definately aren't matching what they say.  Overall, it's worth the price.
