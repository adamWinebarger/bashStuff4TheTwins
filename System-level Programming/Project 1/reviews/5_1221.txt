I played this game and never wanted to stop. In my opinion, this is the best RPG game ever. It is fun just to play, and run around. The graphics are great, and it is just plain fun. What is also nice is that getting past certain parts of levels aren't very hard, and you don't get upset playing it.
Pros:
1) Great graphics
2) Great plot/storyline
3) Characters look great
4) Easy figuring out what to do
5) Just plain fun
Cons:
1) Ummm
