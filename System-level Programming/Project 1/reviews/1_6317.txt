It sure does. Old, boring, hard to play and hard to control. This game is more fun than a sharp stick to the eye but not by much. And the price when it first came out! Sheesh! I'm betting that the only reason some people buy this is Lara's chest and that doesn't justify purchasing this accident of a game.
