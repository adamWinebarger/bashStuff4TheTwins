I have always liked this game overall, and it will always have a special place in my heart. With that said, the rubberbanding A.I. in this game is beyond ridiculous. No lead is safe as the game cheats to catch up to you by increasing the speed of its controlled drivers to higher than they can possibly go. I don't know if later Mario Kart games ditched the rubberbanding A.I., but its presence is strong in this one.
