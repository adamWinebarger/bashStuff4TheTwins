This game is pretty good for its own sake. It's basically about a dead warrior in a land of ghouls & zombies who attack him at every turn, & it is up to you to find the Chaos Rune, among other hidden treasures arrayed throughout this underworld of bizarre incarnations.

 The animations are up to 3-D par, although I will remark on the variety of different angles. The graphics are japanamistic, but nonetheless amusing.
