This is a great follow up to Fate of Atlantis, and it's nice to see Indy jumped into 3D. The textures are really nice, and it carries a lot of Typical Indy puzzles. Sure it looks  a lot like Tomb Raider, but you know Indy was there first. This game needs to be ported to PS. The only downfall is theat the programming is a little tempermental in Win2000, but then again, what isn't? Plus there are patches for this game. this is worth the buy. You won't be disappointed.
