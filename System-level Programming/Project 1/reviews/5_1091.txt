"Goldeneye 007", at first glance, looks like yet another installment into the tired and outdated "First-Person" shooter game genre. The big suprise is that it is so much more than a standard shooter or a bog standard movie translation.
In a word, "Goldeneye" is amazing. It takes full advantage of the 64 bit technology and delivers a smooth, fun, and challenging adventure. You assume the role of James Bond, the secret agent who needs no introduction. You run through various missions, which tie into the movie, and solve various problems and perform various tasks. What complicates things is the number of guards who are ready to kill you on sight. As expected, you have a number of weapons at your disposal, from the silenced pistol and machine gun, to the grenade launchers and high-powered explosives. The first-person perspective adds amazing realism to this game, with action and controls that are as smooth as James Bond's charm.
The graphics are phenominal, with smooth movements and amazing scenery. This game really makes you feel like you are living the adventures. The music is right out of a Bond movie, and adds a nice edge to the action. The controls, usually quite clunky on that horrible N64 controller, are easy to manage here. After a while it becomes like second nature.
For parents considering this game for their children, they should be aware of the violence. Much of the game is spent killing people, and the realism is striking. It is up to you, but this is an excellent game that can be quite addictive.
