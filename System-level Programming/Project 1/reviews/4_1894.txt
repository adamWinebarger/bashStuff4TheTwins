This is where the epic Resident Evil series began. The first adventure see's you tackle zombies, snakes and dogs in a deserted mansion, which is very atmospheric. Don't be put off by the relatively poor voice acting and cut scenes, bear in mind that this was made in 1995/1996 and so for the times it's pretty good. This is a classic game that spawned one of the best series' of games on the Playstation. The only thing preventing this from being a 5 star game is the slighty disapointing ending. But this is only a minor flaw, and this is still one of the best games on the Playstation.
