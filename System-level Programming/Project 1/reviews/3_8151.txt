The X-Files Game is a great adventure/mystery game. I couldn't stop playing once I started. Great story, cool missions. ONE PROBLEM I beat it in one day! And it has NO REPLAY VALUE! Once you beat it once then thats it! It's no fun to play again because you know whats going to happen. I suggest you rent it instead of buying it, because it only takes about 8hrs to beat. But still, it's deffinately worth checking out!
