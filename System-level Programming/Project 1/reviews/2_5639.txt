Long have I had the PC version of Darkstone, and last month I purchased the playstation version, it was HORRIBLE!! it wasn't worth the 10 dollars, instead i returned it to the store and reinstalled the PC version and played it that way. there's no 2-character usage in the playstation version, and the graphics are way worse, my PC is a 96' PC and it plays much better on it. I extremly highly reccomend the PC version, but the playstation version stinks.
