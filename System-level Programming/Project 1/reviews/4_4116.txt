NFL 2K is one of the best football games ever. First of all it has great graphics,it also has great play calling interface and last but not least begginers can get used to the game fast. Some of the flaws in this game is that there is no franchise mode and  when you whant to play a season the space to save a season on your V.M.U. is outrageous 140 blocks of space leaving you with ten blocks of space left. One last problem is the running game there is know way in hell that your running back is ever going to run for a 60 yard touchdown because it is amazing just to be able to run 20 yards in this game. Well i have told you the pros and the cons about the game if you ask me though the cons did not stop me from liking this game,there are some games that i walk away from either whanting my money back or being truly [ticked] off but not this one.
