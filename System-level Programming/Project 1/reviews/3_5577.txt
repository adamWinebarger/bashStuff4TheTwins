In all my years of gaming, I can truly say FINALLY that Sega has a good shooting/Doom/whatever game. The problem is you can't really aim that well without getting shot about fifty times. The multiplayer is average; online-capability would've been sweet. All in all, the graphics are, like any other Dreamcast game worth its salt, breathtaking. The sounds are nice, with explosions and speaking roles (not too bad voice acting, if I might add) however, the gameplay tends to wear thin and becomes stale after about three weeks. But thy'll be the best spent three weeks of your life. Get it. Now.
