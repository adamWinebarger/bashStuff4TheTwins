This is the best action game for the Playstation that I have ever played.  During the game, you play and Crash and his sister Coco.  Their goal is to compete 25 levels to get all of the crystals needed to defeat Neo Cortex.  For every five levels there is also a boss that must be defeated.  Defeating each boss gives Crash a new 'power move' that will be needed in upcoming levels.  There are also five 'bonus' levels in the game.  The levels have Crash and Coco running, swimming, flying planes and spaceships, and riding tigers, jetskis, dinosaurs, and harleys.  For an additional challenge, you can try to get the one or two gems that are found on each level.  This usually requires smashing all of the boxes found on the level.  For an even greater challenge, you can try to get the relic found on each level by racing thru the level under a specified amount of time.
Warning!  This game is very addictive!  I can't stop playing until I get all of the crystals, gems, and relics.  Even though my goal is to complete the game, it's entertaining to watch all of the different ways Crash can die (see what happens when a frog catches you or when you get stuck by the porcupine fish).  The game offers much variety which keeps it very interesting, but is still easy to learn because of the limited number of controls.  If you ever get stuck and can't figure out how to get a crystal, gem, or relic, there are several walkthrus that can be found on the web.  I highly recommend buying this game.  I can't imagine anybody not liking it, unless they just like the hardcore shooting games like Quake (hey...in this game, Crash has a bazooka).  If you like this game and racing games, I also highly recommend Crash Team Racing (CTR).  I can't wait until the new Crash Bandicoot game comes out for the PS2.
