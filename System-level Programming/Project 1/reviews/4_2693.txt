This game is the one my kids play more than any other on their Nintendo. They have other games, they rent other games, but they keep coming back to this one.
They like the two player option. They like the challenge  (they're not teens yet). They like the many characters that can be chosen  from different games. They like being able to set their and the opponent's  skill levels. They just love this game!
I personally wish it were a  little less violent, but compared to other games out there, this is a  teaparty. So if you're a parent looking for a fun game that will give your  kids hundreds of hours of play and one they won't get tired of, buy this  game.
