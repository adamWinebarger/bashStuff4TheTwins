In my opinion, the only thing this game has going for it is that it didn't have any competition in the field of RPGs until the Zelda action RPGs.  The developers of this game should be ashamed of themselves for creating this.  I bought the game a couple of years ago and it still sits there and collects dust.  I probably played it for four hours or so and put it away.  I want those four hours back that I wasted.  Nevermind, I would just waste them anyways.
