The original Crash game was very hard to beat.  It was still classic.  Then Crash 2 came out, with several hard levels and tough bosses.  Then out came this one, Crash Warped.  This is the cult classic of the series.  I have beaten the entire game, and never once been disappointed because of too much or too little challenge. I even managed to get a 104% file with the help of my brother and a twerp i know.  There are two secret levels.  They are Eggipus Rex and Hot Coco.  To get to Eggipus Rex,  you go into time trails in the Dino Might! level.  Then, board the yellow gem platform.  Keep running until you find the second pterydactyl (the triceratops will be already chasing you) and let it take you away.  To get into the Hot Coco level, simply crash into the road sign with an alien on it in the Road Crash level.  This game is a classic and every PS One or PS2 owner needs to have it.
