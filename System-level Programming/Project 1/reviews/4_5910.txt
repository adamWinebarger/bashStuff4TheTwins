This game is very nice it was hard and it took me a month to beat it.  Ok I do admit some of the charecters from 3 and Ultimet suck so I don't pick them.  Yet I can't help but love it when I do Scorpions attacks and defeat Kahn.  Yet number two will always be the best I think Unless Midway goes back with the old charecters and get some real writers for a better plot!!!
