When I heard Nintendo was coming out with superman I got all excited, then they delayed the release date, which usually means the game is going under even more improvements.  When I bought Superman I sped all the way home, turned off my phone and sat in my chair.  To my suprise, this game is not worth the plastic it's made of.  I don't even have one good thing to say about it.  I was extremely disappointed.  Superman used to be cool.
