This game wasn't very challenging, but fun nevertheless.  The idea is to build a roller coaster park, which may also include thrill rides, gentle rides, and water rides.  The people, whom you can see in your park even as you build, roam your park.  You can spy on each one's thoughts.  You need to keep them from getting thirsty or hungry and provide bathrooms.  You need to make sure they don't vomit often and clean it up when they do.  You can build any roller coaster yourself, or choose from preset designs.  Building roller coasters is a bit of a challenge, since it can be hard to connect the end to the beginning, but they can fit the given space more easily than preset ones.  It's important to balance your budget and keep track of prices.  This game is easy to win, but takes a long time to play.  I recommend this for anyone who wants a laid back simulation and for people who want to build the ultimate roller coaster.
