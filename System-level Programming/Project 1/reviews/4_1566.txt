Perhaps SC3K's main problem is that it is far too detailed. Even on a speedy top-end machine the screen will fill with portions of white if you try to scroll at one of higher resolutions. Perhaps this is also SC3K's  main virtue - the fact that you can see down to the last person in your  metropolis. Whatever you say, despite the game's vast graphical and  not-so-vast strategic advances, it failed to do what the fans of the series  held closest to their hearts - personalization. The city develops  completely at random within your zonal confines - you cannot make a  candleshop district, a Downtown, or anything of the sort. You cannot name  streets, despite the fact that you place them yourself. The papers mention  you rarely and glancingly, at best, preferring to metion senseless rock  bands (whose names you cannot supply either) or some other uneventful  thing. The advisors are as helpful as ever - specifically, useless. They  either take no notice of the trouble befalling your city, or they take  notice of something very minor and blow it up to the size of a scandal. THE  1% COMMERCIAL TAX IS KILLING THE CITY!  REMOVE THE PARKING FINES!  All  the while industry fails to develop and a major power outage goes  unnoticed.
This game is a cleaner, crisper version of SimCity 2000,  perhaps an update, but in no way a new game in the series.
