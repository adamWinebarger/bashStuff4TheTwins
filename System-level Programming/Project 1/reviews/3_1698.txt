Twisted Metal started the whole car battle racing genre for the game consoles, but it was not the first of it's kind.  For that you have to look to the British video game Carmageddon.  It was the first and IMHO still the best one out there!

Both games now look a bit dated, but for sheer fun and mayhem, they can't be beat and Camageddon is the deeper game of the two.
