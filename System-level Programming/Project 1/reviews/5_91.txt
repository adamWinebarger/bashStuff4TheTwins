This is one of the coolest box sets I've ever purchased. I like the minimalism of the books themselves. Hylian crest and gold embellishments around the borders, different color for each game, titles on spine. They simply look amazing. The chest box is pretty cool too, but I'm not as impressed with it since I generally prefer to display books in the traditional upright position on a bookshelf. But it's a great tie-in to the games since opening chests is always something you associate with Zelda games.

My only regrets are paying extremely high prices for individual new/sealed guides a year ago before this set was announced. I paid closer to $200 to get them all brand new on eBay. This set will surely devalue my existing ones since I'm planning on now reselling them. But I had to get this set since it included the OoT 3D guide that you can't get separately.

I really don't get why they would release this set so close to the guide for A Link Between Worlds. Did no one have the foresight to either include a blank spot for the new guide, or actually include the new guide in this set? In a way it makes the set feel instantly out of date right at release. But oh well, not that big of a deal. I will be purchasing that one separately before it also becomes sold out everywhere and triples in price like Twilight Princess did.
