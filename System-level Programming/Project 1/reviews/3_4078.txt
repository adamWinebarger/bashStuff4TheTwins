This is the one game that, by now, every Dreamcast owner already has. And deservedly so; it's easy to pick up and it's blindingly fast. Problem is, it's so fast, you'll blow right through it in a few hours. It's too bad Sega felt the need to tack on the other characters. All the non-Sonic levels are boring (especially the big cat levels where you fish). Then there's the terrible music. I recommend muting your TV and playing your own music on a CD player because the in-game music just doesn't work at all. Or you could listen to it for a good laugh.
