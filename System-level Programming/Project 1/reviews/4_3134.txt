Ahhhhh  FF7, fond memories.  The first RPG and first Final Fantasy game I ever played.  Sweet mother of god you are ugly now!
All things aside Final Fantasy 7 visually is probably one of the ugliest games in existence, but the story, characters, combat and track keep it still relevant nowadays for a reason.  If you're  into classics or are curious, I shouldn't be the only person recommending you FF7.
