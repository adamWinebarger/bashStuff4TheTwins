This is an odd mixed bag.  You have, on one hand, an honest-to-God intriguing story, with original characters and above-average voice-overs.  You got side-quests, hidden treasures, and deep background folklore...  Everything to please those who like a good book.  The graphics are good, except I would have preferred more animation frames on some characters...  Oh well...
Then you have the battles.  This is where the pain starts.  It is somewhat reminiscent of the real-time/turn-based hybrid battle system from the Final Fantasy series, with the added depth of having characters "build-up" three levels of power with time.  Like Final Fantasy, battles build up your characters' stats, to prepare for that ultimate final battle against the big boss.  Unlike Final Fantasy, the battles aren't that much fun.  The creature types are more or less the same, with minor color variations.  And you don't feel compelled to fight in the first place.  You don't want to fight; you just want to continue with the adventure...
The only thing that (may) push you forward is the top-class story.  The Story is what drives this game through, just like a good book.  Want to turn to the next page?  Well, must fight about 20 creatures 20 times to know what happens next.
This is the problem (for me at least).  An excellent story matched with a boring battle system make the final product a game of patience.  Recommend you download the demo first!  If you feel that you can enjoy this game based on the demo, by all means, buy-it!  If you are more of the impatient type, well either buy this game and download cracks or cheats, or look elsewhere.
This game would have been a better adventure game than an RPG.
