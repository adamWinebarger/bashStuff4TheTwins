Spec Ops: Stealth Patrol puts you in the life of a ranger. This proves to be quite the task. The first level turns out to be amazingly hard with enemies running around EVERYWHERE and almost no medi-packs at your  disposal. The solution? Call a friend and beat the game in two-player mode.  It turns out that it's a really, really fun game! Kneeling and laying on  your stomach become your best friend when dodging enemy fire. Learning to  search around the area and sneaking up on soldiers shows that medi-packs  are equaly spread throughout levels. Choose your men wisely, as some  missions need someone that can use a scope to take out those irresistible  mines. The graphics, sound, and game mechanics are really great for only [the price]. The only drawback I have is that when you're calling your buddy to  follow you, he can get hung up on things like trees or cliffs -and- the  game could go much smoother without mines on every inch of ground. Overall,  your ... bucks couldn't go to better use. Nothing feels better than seeing  an Iraqi through your scope, or watching the little red sights appear on a  Viet-Kong.
