I got this game at a great price and couldn't pass it up.  At first it was kind of fun, but after a while I noticed that I wasn't feeling too hot.  Something about the 3D motion in this game makes me nauseated.  It's plenty difficult and the multiplayer is pretty fun, but this game is not for the squeamish.
