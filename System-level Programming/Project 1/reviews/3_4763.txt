Being a fan of the original two RB games, I ordered this game when I got a new PC with Windows ME.  Only problem is, I get "jitter" everytime I move the joystick up or down.  I tried a new joystick, but it didn't fix the problem. Inquiries to Sierra went unanswered.  The game is cool when I fly in a straight line, but having to go up or down gives me motion sickness. Anyone else have this problem?
