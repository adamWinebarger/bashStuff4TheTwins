I bought this game not too long ago never having played a turn-based strategy game, although I am a longtime veteran of RTSs.  At first it was a lot of fun, researching new stuff, taking over towns, etc, but it began to  get boring.  Three or four levels into the single player game, it was still  extraordinarily easy, and I already had access to most of the upgrades, but  it was getting annoying.  You can't have parties of more than eight, so  when taking on a castle garrisonning 20 enemies, things get quite  ridiculous.  All of the units are pretty even in strength, and the  cutscenes were not very good, basically a bunch of still shots blending  together.
I do buy games for the single-player, though.  I don't have a  great internet connection, so my reviews don't apply to multiplayer aspects  of games.  It may be great online, I don't know.  However, offline it is  fun and addictive for the first few days, and then it quickly becomes yet  another game junked onto the shelf.
Caution -- when you're playing, this  game becomes one of those "Just a couple more minutes" games that  you never stop playing.
