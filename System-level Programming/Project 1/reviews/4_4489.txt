I bought Rollercoaster Tycoon a long time ago. This game is pretty exciting for anyone who dreams of running their own theme park. You can build from over 14 different rollercoaster plus you can build your own race tracks and alot of other exciting rides. But the fun doesn't end there. You have to put up food stands, bathrooms, trash cans, shops, and some nice scenery to keep your guests happy. You have to build thrilling Rollercoasters for the intense guests but if you build a Rollercoaster that has too much intensity, nobody will ride it. That's the challenging part of the game. But, not all people like Rollercoasters. A lot of people prefer gentler rides such as Go Karts or the Merry-Go-Round. You can also hire Entertainers to help keep your guests happy. When your guests are complaining about how long your line is just pop in an Entertainer right there and it will cheer up the guests and in no time they'll be on the ride. You also must hire Mechanics, Guards, and Custodians to clean up the park and take out the trash! If you don't build good rides and don't have enough scenery and shops then your guests will be unhappy and destroy your benches and trash cans...then you gotta replace them. You can help stop vandalism by hiring a few Guards that patrol the park. So those are just the main reasons why I like this game. You can build about jsut anything you can imagine. So why did I give this game 4 stars? Well, because this game gets very boring after a while. I'm into multiplayer games like Quake 3 Arena or StarCraft. But whenever I come home from a theme park I wish I still had this game. I may even buy it again. Trust me, this game is a hit for all you people who like to be the boss.
