Getting this game would be a waste of time and money.  For halfthe price of this I'd rather get a game that offers better graphics,better realism, and better everything.  If you haven't already guessed it's Red Alert.  Even though it looks pretty good, after about a week you won't want to play it anymore.  With Red Alert I continually go back to try just one more strategy... I think they just sat down and set a deadline for this game and the guys making it waited until the last week to do it.  Right now all you need to do is type in the search box up there "Red Alert" and buy that game... You will have a way better game and not spend as much.
