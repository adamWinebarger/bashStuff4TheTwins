Seriously. As awesome as the games before and after this game are, there is truly NO touching OOT. The story is amazing and well thought out, the game play is simple, the music is suburb, and all console Zelda games stem from this right here. SUCH as excellent game. There is no surprise many gaming magazines regard OOT as the greatest Zelda game or Video Game...of all time.
