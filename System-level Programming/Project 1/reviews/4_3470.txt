Until the Dreamcast came along no other system could handle the 2-D graphic processing power of a lot of 2-D games without a lot of loading.  Marvel VS Capcom is better on the Dreamcast than it was in the arcades, the control is easy, the graphics are sharp and crisp and bright, and the action is fast, so fast you might lose track of what your doing.  Though it was overshadowed by it's superior sequel, Marvel VS Capcom is a must own Dreamcast title on its own.  Also recommended is Marvel VS Capcom 2, Power Stone 1&2, Capcom VS SNK, Street Fighter Alpha 3, Dead or Alive 2, and Soul Calibur.
