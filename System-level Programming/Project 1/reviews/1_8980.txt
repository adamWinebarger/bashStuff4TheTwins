Next to Sega CD the worst version of DOOM.  The graphics suck and you can barely tell what anything is, the sound is decent (the one star), the controls are horrid, the gameplay is horrid and the shores of hell freezes up on start, so all you really have is a butchered port of Knee Deep & Inferno with horrid controls.  Terrible.
