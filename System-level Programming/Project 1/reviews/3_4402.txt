I am a huge fps fan, but i don't get why everyone likes this game so much.  I found it rather boring and dull.  The gameplay was slow, most of the game was just going around looking for buttons to push to activate different things, which got old in about the first 20 minutes of gameplay.  i admit this game is very good, but i just cant see why it has gotten so much hype.  if u want to get the coolest fps then get Clive Barker's Undying
