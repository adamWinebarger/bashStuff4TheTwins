I am not a huge fan of the 3D fighting games, I prefer 2D fighters, but I must say Virtua fighter 3tb is a great game. I bought this game a few days ago and played it, and I liked it. It is different from 2D fighters in the sense that it adds more realism to the bouts, no fancy fireballs or stuff like that, just pure strategic hand to hand contact fighting. It takes a while to know your moves but once you get it you will enjoy this game. I gave it three stars because I still haven't learned the moves, and I hear Soul Calibur is the better choice, but do not dismiss this game just yet, it will definetely deliver.
