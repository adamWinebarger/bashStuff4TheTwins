Well I received this title over the weekend, and still have not been able to get it off the  ground.
This is what I am having problems with and have encountered getting technical  support (a nightmare!!).
Game Problems:
1. Going to 'instant action' from the main game menu, I am presented with a CTD (Crash To Desktop), which means the game crashes, and your back at your desktop.
2. In The game, you need to review crew status, mission briefings ,etc. well so far I can not view these, do to they don't appear while in the game.
Applied the latest patch (v1.06) to correct allot of the bugs and CTD, and still have the above problems.
Now the Nightmare!:
* Web Sites mentioned, do not work - Either receive a blank page, 404 Not Found, or Virtual Directory: Access denied error.
* Phone Support - They have changed their number already from the one in the manual. Called the new number, and was thrown into a loop from a dysfunctional automated phone system. And then finally was told I was in a 60 minute call waiting queue.
* E-Mail support - Received an auto response saying their e-mail address is no longer valid. I was then pointed to a new web site which pointed me back to the original Hasbro Interactive Dysfunctional web site.
So I am preparing to send this piece of junk back for a refund. This is the LAST Hasbro/Micrprose software that I buy.
