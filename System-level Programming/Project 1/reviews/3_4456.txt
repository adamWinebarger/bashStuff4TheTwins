The story is epic in every way, but the 12 unit selection puts a HUGE damper on the enjoyment of this game. We need a mod or patch that does away with it. Also, they should've included the editor guide in this collection, not to mention the 64 missions. And the terran and zerg campaigns in this game (vanilla, not brood war) have been outdone by their novelizations: Liberty's Crusade by Jeff Grubb, and Queen of Blades by Aaron Rosenberg. I strongly recommend them.
