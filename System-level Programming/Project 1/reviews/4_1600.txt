Doom for PS1 is a great game. Almost every level from Ultimate Doom & Doom II is here, plus some new levels never before seen on the PC. This game is dark, scary as hell, and can really get in your head. The soundtrack is totally different from the PC, and creates a very eerie atmosphere that few games ever do. The controls are easy to learn, that's a good thing. However, the only reason why I gave this game 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the graphics. Yes, as you may have already read, the graphics are a bit sluggish, especially when compared to the PC version. In my opinion, the best version of Doom is the PC version, period. Doom, Doom 2, and Final Doom are the best video games ever, in MY opinion.
