Originally playing Rogue Leader (Star Wars: Rogue Squadron 2), it's great to get back to the keystone that started the whole franchise. While not allowing for some of the more advanced gameplay from future games, this product is and was fantastic for the age of N64 era gaming. A much needed classic to add to the collection for sure.
