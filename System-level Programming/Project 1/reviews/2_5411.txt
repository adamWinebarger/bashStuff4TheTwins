I love the story and this is what started the series, but I hate the game itself in terms of gameplay. The controls are a bit unresponsive, the combat is a joke and the prima strategy guide is an outright marketing scam. I just had to tell the truth of what I think about this. The gameplay is so bad for me that it just ruins the entire thing for me. I'd rather just watch someone play it with no commentary.
