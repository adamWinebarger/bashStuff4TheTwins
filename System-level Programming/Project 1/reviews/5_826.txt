I share a great relationship with this game. Before it came out, I received a promotional VHS Tape in the mail that told me about the game, its stages, and gameplay. It was a better instruction manual than the booklet! I also love how the footage was taken from the beta version of the game. With its promotional montage, you could tell this was also back when they were going to make Conker's game another cartoony adventure rather than the adult-oriented one they ended up making.
 - Anyway the game is fantastic, a perfect supplement to Super Mario 64. In some ways it's actually better. When I was a kid I used ALL the cheats, to just have fun and explore. I played it enough times to 100% the game in two hours. And then when GameFAQs started to be a thing, I used the lesser-known cheats to get the ice key and the secret eggs. For those who like those old days of collecting stuff, this is the game to get.
