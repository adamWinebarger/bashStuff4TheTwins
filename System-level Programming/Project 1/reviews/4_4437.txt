This is a great game and remake of the original "Theme Park" made in the early 90's (?).  It is so addicting and time consuming so make sure you've got plenty of time to waste before you sit down to play. (...) It's definitely a great game, although the graphics aren't quite up to snuff with today's technology, but you get over that.  It definitely has challenges, too, so don't think you can just breeze through the scenarios.  A definite buy for your family gamer.
