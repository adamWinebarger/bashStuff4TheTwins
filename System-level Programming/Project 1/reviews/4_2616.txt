A really good game. You get 8 characters to play as, and 4 unlockables. 9 stages and lots of items. First player mode is fun (and really hard to unlock nes). Playable up to four players. Free for all and team modes are available, as well as time and stock modes. Overall a great game that is fun for people of all ages.
