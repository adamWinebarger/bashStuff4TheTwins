I recieved this game for one of my birthday's many years ago. At first I was excited...but when I played it...oh boy. The Graphics were horrible, too rough and generic. To make matters worse, they looked like cheap cartoon drawings.

The missions were dull. Your first mission is to fly though magical rings. The Story is even worse, you have to save random civilians using various powers. The levels keep jumping, so your never in the same place.

The multiplayer was kinda fun, but it gets dull fast. Basicly, it shifts to fps and you shoot other people for points. other than that, this is probably the worst game I have ever played. Don't buy this game...rent it at most..or borrow it.
