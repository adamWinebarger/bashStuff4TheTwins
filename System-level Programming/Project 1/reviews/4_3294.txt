I had heard about the FF series but never paid too much attention to it mainly because I didn't have a PS, fast foward to a couple of years and I was trying to get some games for my PS2 library I fell upon FFX let me just say I was blown away and I think the FF bug bit me hard, I bought X-2 and told everyone I got it for my sis. Then talking with other FF Fantics they told me about VII. I haven't finished it yet that is why I gave it a 4 star review but it is awesome so far. Love the scene where Cloud has the Motorcycle. Despite the age of this game it really does stand the test of time and personally I agree with belledandy about doing a remake I'd probably be the first person to buy it too. For people considering buying this game, believe me when I say it is 'worth every penny you spend on it' If you are a fan of RPGs or of games on the whole, it's great, I really don't care if people call it the best game ever or not all I know is that since I have started playing it I can't put it down and my family and friends do feel neglected.
