If you are familiar with the Harvest Moon series, or even if you are not and you enjoy RPG/Simulation games, this game is a good addition to your collection.  In Harvest Moon 64, you play as a guy who gets to run a farm and have a personal life.
The method of farming in this game is completely done by your character; you till the land, plant the seeds, and water them until plants grow.  And you have to do everything in 2 minutes and 45 seconds because you wake up at 6:00 a.m., hours in this game are 15 seconds long, and the person that picks up the crops comes at 5:00 p.m..  However, time does not pass while you are in buildings.  If you do to much without eating or sleeping (sleeping brings you to the next day), you will not be able to use tools.
Compared to the Harvest Moon for the Super Nintendo, this game has a good number of new features:
1) Tools power-up with the amount of times they are used, as apposed to completing a certain event in the game that gives you a stronger tool.
2) You have to buy your groceries (the food you automatically eat when you wake up and at noon).
3) You can raise sheep!  The money comes from their wool.
4) There are new competitions that include racing your dog or horse.
I could go on and on about the new aspects of HM64.
However, in HM64, there is a lot of misparagraphed text and there are also some bugs in the game.  One bug in particular that I have found is that at some point in the game, Elle's grandmother may die if you talk to her, usually during spring.  Make sure this never happens on a day when something is happening (New Years, etc.) or your game will freeze.
Even with the bugs (try to avoid them!!!), this game still stands out as a great "real life" video game.
