Before there was Tekken and Soul Blade and the rest of the current fighters there was Street Fighter and Mortal Kombat.  Mortal Kombat was easily the best in terms of richness of the game.  The characters moved  fluidly, the voices were understandable, and there was blood.  The series  progressed nicely with great additions and secrets added every step of the  way.
This title is a great, nostalgic look back at those times.  Being  able not only to play any of the characters from the first 3 games, but  also as their different incarnations is huge.  When the Genesis/Super  Nintendo became obsolete I feared the loss of these games.  But with their  release on Playstation, especially in this title, I am happy.  The game  play is great and packed full of surprises.  As far as 2D fighting games  goes, this is the best and is better than many first generation 3D  fighters.  If you liked this in the arcade, you'll like it here.  Granted,  it has the usual translation problems with the buttons in the  wrong places  and more difficulty moving the stick, but you get those problems with any  console game.
