Simcity 3000 is a good simulation.  The graphics are outstanding, the music is ok, it is fun to look down and see vehicles driving on the streets and the people walking around.  Even the sound effects match with the specific area of the city you are looking at.  For example, high-crime residential areas feature sporadic gunfire, rapid footsteps and the clanging of a chain-link fence.  the bustling commercial areas feature heavy traffic noises and sirens, and industrial areas have heavy truck and machinery noises.  You control the layout of the streets and the zoning.  Then the city develops itself, according to land values and access to transportation.
The not-so-good:  When areas become blighted and buildings are abandoned, the buildings become black boarded-up boxes that no longer resemble the original building style-- for example, a twelve story apartment building, when abandoned, becomes a three-story black box with boarded-up windows.  You cannot have suspension bridges cross above highways or city streets.  ALL the streets intersect (no way to build overpasses, except highways crossing streets) There is no way to build elevated rail lines-- the railroad must cross every street at an intersection.  Also, you are mostly restricted to a north-south street grid system
Overall, this is a great game.  I just felt like pointing out some flaws that might annoy some people.
