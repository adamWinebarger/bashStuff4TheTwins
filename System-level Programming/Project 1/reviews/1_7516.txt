Well, here it is guys: the WORST Mortal Kombat game of all-time.  Yup, the honor goes to the Game Boy version of Mortal Kombat II.

I bought this game when it first came out because I was stupidly riding on the success of the Mortal Kombat series at the time.  I was very naive (all my friends were right!)

Time hasn't been kind to this game, but who am I kidding?  Time wasn't kind to this game the day it came out because it was an absolute piece of plastic trash then, and it's trash now.  It will forever remain trash.  It's so trashy, the trashman won't even take it.  He says it stinks too much, and it's not worth the risk of potentially sniffing the horrible odor *just* to put the game in the back of his truck.  Even if he were to wear the thickest pair of gloves in the world, he doesn't want to risk the smell remaining on his skin permanently.

So why am I bashing the game so hard?  Because you get fewer fighters, fewer levels, HORRIBLE black and white graphics, and the worst part- an extremely slow framerate.  The blood doesn't even exist.  Okay there's blood, but watching it on a hard-to-see black and white screen, would you even call that blood?  No, you wouldn't (and shouldn't).

I would rather have a job being a janitor in an elementary school and having to clean up barf on the cafeteria floors every day, than play the Game Boy version of Mortal Kombat II ever again.  It's really that bad.  At least then, you can swirl the puke around with a mop and have some fun.

For the love of God and all his wonderful adorable Earthly creatures- DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!  Just when I thought the Mortal Kombat series couldn't get any crappier, it happened.
