What can I possibly say about this game that hasn't been said a million times.
Perfection.
Groundbreaking.
Beautiful.

Just some of the words that come to mind when I think of Zelda 64.
Zelda was my introduction to RPG's and what an introduction it was.

The good.
Everything.
Graphics, story, pacing, etc...
Insanely difficult in parts, I still can't beat the water temple without the walk through.
And Ganon in the painting still has to be one of the coolest boss battles of all time.

The bad?
Nothing.
One of the games that not only defined the N64 but a game that set the standard for excellence in RPG's.

One of the best...ever.
Highest recommendations.
