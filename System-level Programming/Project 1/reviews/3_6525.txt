I'll start by saying this: yes, "Diablo II" is a good game, but no, it simply isn't where it should be: considering the huge hype and all that.
The gameplay is still the same. You choose your character from five different classes, and than wear out two or three mouses as you battle your way to the Lord of Terror himself, Diablo. The most significant difference is the new character skills. You now how the ability to choose from a set of skills as you gain in level, and thus customizing your character to fit your style of play. The game levels have moved above ground, so that you can explore wilderness areas (but also dungeons). There's a weather effect which allows for rain and lightening. And there's different NPCs you can interact with and even hire to aid you. But other than this, the game is exactly the same.
The graphics is the biggest let-down of the game. They're horribly outdated. The cinematic sequences, however, are the best I've seen. So if you don't mind going over the first game in a bigger scale, you'll probably be able to extract some excitement from the game.
