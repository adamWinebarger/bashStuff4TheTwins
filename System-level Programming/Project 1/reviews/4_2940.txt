If you are looking for story as the driving force behind an RPG, then this is a game you will enjoy.  Lunar doesn't rely on graphics or amazing sound.  It relies on the strength of its storyline.  The graphics are the type you'd find on an older system, which makes sense because this game was originally released on the Sega-CD.  This comes with two bonus CD's. One is a soundtrack, which is nothing to be excited about since the music isn't something you'd want to listen to outside of the game, but is a nice touch.  The other is a making of CD that was rather interesting because you get to see how much the people who made this game were into it and cared about the finished product.
One of the neat things about this game is all of the voice acting.  It's such a nice touch and really adds a lot to the game.  The female voices can seem rather whiny and too high pitched (which could be said of the males at times too), but other than that, it's quite good.  Also, there is a lot of pop culture references and innuendo going on that make you laugh.  That may be the best thing about the game.  The story is fun.  The game is fun.  You have fun playing the game.
It's not new.  It's not full of eye candy.  But the game is very enjoyable and worth the money if you enjoy playing with a good story.
