and you just became part of it.
Pros:
Brought violence and profanity in videogames to a whole new level
Very good sound effects
long enjoyable levels and misions
A short, but destructable arsenoal
Very useful cheat codes(Despit I usally don't cheat)
Pretty good music
Cons:
The graphics are plain out horrible
one shot death(A bit too realistic)well, unless you have armor
Can't save until you beat a level
definitly not for kids
The game suffers from slowdowns, if too many things are on the screen
In 98 this game was jst a instant classic, despite being overshadowed by loads of games(especially Metal Gear Solid, and Zelda:Ocorina of time).  It's definitly unknown since GTA 3 and Vice City overshadowed it by a loooong mile, but yet I still play this game from time to time.  In this game you could even say ... the police and let them eat the gat, take out a squad of them with a machine gun, blaze them up with a flame thrower, or just blow them away with almighty rocket launcher(That was propably the main reason this game got a lot of heat form contaversy).  If you're used to GTA 3 or Vice City, then this game will hardly be interesting to you, but if you have this game, then I'm sure you appreciate the joy the classic burng to you, and took you on the crazy ride from this, all the way to vice city.
Final Words:Speaking of Vice City, That was one of the levels in this game, and so was liberty City, and San Anderess is the last city.  Could San Andress be the next Grand Theft Auto?  Hmmmm...
peace
