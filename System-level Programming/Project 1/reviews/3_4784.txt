I wrote this review to educate all of the hardcore gamers out there...especially those who love long RPGs.  Don't get me wrong, the Playstation has a lot of great games, and the the controllers are quite durable and well designed.  The problem with the Playstation lies within it's hardware.  If you play games a lot (especially role playing games), be ready to invest in a new Playstation about every 7-8 months.  I use my Playstation about 1 hour a day...sometimes more when playing through a role playing game, and I've had to go through 3 Playstations in the past couple of years.  There are several factors that contribute to the breaking down of the Playstation.  Overheating, the track wearing out, and the CD chuck under the lid that falls apart after a while.  The overheating problem can be aleviated by investing in a cooling fan, but there is not much else you can do for the other problems. Typical signs of overuse include skipping, longer load times, and freezing. Don't bother turning the system on it's side or upside down, doing so will only further ruin the Playstation and your disc and is probably also a fire hazard. My only advice is keep your Playstation out of hot places, away from lots of electronic equipment, do not put it on top of a VCR, and always unplug it after use (the AC adapter device is internal, therefore causing the system to heat up even when not in use if you do not unplug it). Hopefully Sony will learn from this and the Playstation 2 will be a lot more durable.
