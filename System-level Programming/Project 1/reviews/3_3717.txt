Resident Evil 3: Nemesis - Circa 2000

GOOD:
- Nemesis enemy adds a new twist to the game and makes it more intense
- Good story, with twists and turns
- Some nice bonus mini games to unlock

BAD:
- Graphics look pretty dated
- Voice acting is not that great
- Controls feel dated

WILL IT FIT YOUR TASTE:
- Slow moving "survival horror" game, which is more about moving boxes, managing items, and unlocking doors then actually fighting for your life
- A Sc-Fi horror game set in a city over run with zombies, and a super zombie called Nemesis

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:
- Resident Evil 2
- Dino Crisis 2
- Silent Hill
- Alone in the dark

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
- Half of this game takes places during the events of Resident Evil 2
- There is a remake of this game for the Nintendo Game Cube, which doesn't really upgrade anything
- The playable character (Jill) was also one of the playable characters in the first Resident Evil
- In Japan Resident Evil 3: Nemesis is called Biohazard: Last Escape
