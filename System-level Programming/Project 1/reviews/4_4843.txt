I've owned this game for many years.. so long I don't even remember .. pre-2000. To the best of my memory, this game occurred when Sid and the Civ people were having a bit of falling out.. so Sid moved to Fireaxis and produced this game which built into it many of the "improvements" that he forsaw for Civ.. it was in some ways a "pointer" to CIV III and some of the changes to occur there.

Being a 1999 game it has "primitive" graphics.. no 3D etc as in today's games, but I still think they're decent. Also, like Civ II, this is not a half-hour game.. it can go on for some time.. but at least you can save it and pick it up later.

It does occur "beyond Civ".. after the launch of the spaceship and colonization of space.. and involves a new set of "races" and a new tech tree. Some call the tech tree "too foreign" or hard to understand.. but I don't really think so.. the techs may seem "artificial" or "invented" while the Civ tech's seem "real".. that is techs based on things we are familiar with. To me they are just a ladder to climb to more advanced capabilities.. wonders (called "special projects), social options, units, etc.

The game can be won through diplomacy, conquest, transcendence (sort of a human-evolution event), economics, cooperative.. and many rules can be turned "on/off" and "iron man" mode.

Further there is major flexibility in choosing not only governments, but also economics, military, education, environment (big factor in this game), research, health, etc. And you can take "stances" ruthless, moderate, or idealistic for military interactions.  Trade still can play a big role too.

This is not a war game (though it can be played that way).. instead it is an influence and strategy game.. Without being too longwinded, I think its strong points are (relative to Civ II)
* You can use the "governor" much better including customizing it to your own rules.. as opposed to the governor in Civ which I don't know anyone who uses.. (including unit automations) These are especially useful in  to reduce the tedium in the ICS (Infinite City Sprawl) and "pop-booming" strategies often employed where there may be MANY MANY cities.
* Strategic deallings with other civ's are crucial to a successful game.
* Boundaries (or areas of influence) are introduced.. these help "manage" war/peace and some of the really annoying situations in Civ II.
* You can set ingame "slants" on the governor as you progress through appropriate "play styles" of explore, discover, build and conquer.. you have to be prepared to play any of them depending on game circumstances.
* There are MAJOR improvements in automation beyond just the governor and "slants" such as using queue's for building, and "group" commands like "build road to" instead of having to go tile by tile to do it. The GOTO command is improved too complete with mod's like "avoid enemies" etc
* Instead of a lot of units, the units instead are basic, but EXTENSIVE mods can be researched and added to basic units to form new capabilities. This helps avoid the "warrior vs machinegun syndrome"
* All units can be upgraded for a fee.. this is more realistic than the "throwaways" or needing "Leo's Workshop" wonder.
* Materials don't have to be in the city to use it.. they can be "teleported" to other cities from one city or from a distant location if you can control the land.

Well you get the idea.. its just a lot of new stuff.. :)

I DON'T particularly like the huge differences among the races.. some of which have such constraints that they are virtually impossible to win a game with.. only 4 or so really lend themselves to playable games. But I don't think this is a "game stopper".. just a constraint.. It would be nice if some of the traits could be modified to more balance the game, but I truly think they were created to be a foil to the human player. As you play, you can use the "social engineering" for some balancing.

The game is richly complex with numerous "in-play" options, mod's and social structures, etc that can give play variations.

All in all I find it to be a game offering many enjoyable hours.. though it is hard to "FORCE IT" to play your play style.. you instead have to probe for play styles that fit the nature of the challenges of your particular game. I still find myself playing this now and then even 10 years after it's release.

It can be purchased now for the $10-15 range including shipping. I'd say its a definite option at those prices.
