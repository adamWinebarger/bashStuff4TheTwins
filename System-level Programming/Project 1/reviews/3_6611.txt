In my opinion, The Crystal Key is a good game. However, it does have some problems. First of all, when you're looking around the area, the graphics don't blend easily. Also, the puzzles are very challenging (actually, I love challenging games). But I must say it has a very interesting plot. When you finish the game, the villain dies and a screen comes up and says, "Congradulations! You've defeated Ozgar and freed your people!" Then it goes to the main screen. Not much of a congrats. This is the plot: Somewhere out there among the stars, lives another race of people. We know this because, just weeks ago our radio telescopes accidentally intercepted one of their interplaetary communications. When we were able to decode it, this is what we read: "Danger: Ozgar has been defeated but not destroyed. Suralon is sinking. Return to Arkonia. Abandon all colonies at once." Who were the Arkonians? And who or what is Ozgar? Only days later, a gigantic alien spaceship deployed powerful satellites around the earth. All kinds of upheavals occured in the next two days: devastating earthquakes, critical weather shifts, and drastic gravitational changes. Ozgar is coming after us. You, a hypership test pilot, are relatively safe in the polar research station, where the world's first hypership is being constructed. After scientists successfully pinpoint the origin of the Arkonian signal, you are chosen as the last hope; savior of the planet. Your mission? Find the Arkonians and defeat the evil Ozgar. I would recommend this game to people who are very experienced with strategy games.
