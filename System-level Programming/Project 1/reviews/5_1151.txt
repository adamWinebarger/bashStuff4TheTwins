9 out of 10 people will probably see this, and pass it up as another cheap RPG, for one thing you only have 1 dungeon (gasp) when you leve you level back down to 1 (GAsp), and you capture monster just like in Pokemon (GASP).  No it's not a compelation of rip off's, this is a classic that is highly addicting, and incredibly fun, if given a chance.
The story revolves around a young lad (you name) who on his fifteenth birthday is given the opportunity to become a hunter and explore the depths of the Monster Tower to retrieve riches, however to do so he must not only survive, but grow as a trainer and as a man.  In comes the Kewe, the monster you will likely use for a majority of the game.  He is a fire type (there are only three types) and he is your brief tutorial, and key to success early on.
 ... YOu also must build up your respect to the townsfolk, to do this you must enlarge certain places (Temple, Hospital) and build new things (Library, Gym, Casino, Race Track, Bowling Alley ect..) and the town will grow to respect you.
Now as for the tower it'self, there are 40 floors, everytime you leave you go back down to level 1.  No it's not immpossible for two reasons.
A) Your monsters level stays the same when you leave, this is due to the fact that they are more like equipment.
B) Weapons and armors stay the same, when a red or blue sand is used your weapons and armor grow more powerful, so technically you can easily dominate the first few levels without you monsters assistance.
Overall this game is tricky, you will die the first few times (lose all your items except monsters)  but once they are strong enough you can succeed.  There are 40 randomly changeing floors and they get more and more difficult as you go along.  YOu must adjust your mosnters accordingly by class.
A)Fire
B)Wind
C)Water
Fire beats Wind, Water beats Fire, Wind Beats Water.
I would buy this for the challenge it possess, guarennteed addiction.
