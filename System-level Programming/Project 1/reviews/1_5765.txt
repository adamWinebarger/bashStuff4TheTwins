Never before in my gaming experience have I been turned off from a game in the first minute of game play.

The biggest pro in this game is the fact that you can fart and burp and that, my friends, is a sad, sad thing indeed.

The programmers could have saved the gaming community the misery and not released this albatross at all. Heck, I probably would have paid them the 5 bucks I bought it for not to put it on the market and it would have been a win-win for everyone.

I love GTA. It's a great game, but why does the '88 NES Super Mario Bros. have superior graphics to a PS1 game from 1999. It defies rational explanation and this game defies all rationality itself.

I am ashamed to call this a GTA game or even a product from Rockstar.
