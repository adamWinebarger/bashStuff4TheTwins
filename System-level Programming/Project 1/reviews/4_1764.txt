I have been playing video games since pong (the 70's) and I have change with the time (bought a new system every year they come out)and love some of the new play station games but it's good to have some old favorites!! When I bought VOl 3 (just for Mrs. Pac-man)it was like WOW I forgot about pole position (ya nothing like nascar 2002), but that use to be my favorite when I was a kid & still is!! Funny thing is when I was 8yrs old I could never get past the 2nd screen in Galaxian Now 22 years later of playing video games, I still can't get past the 2nd screen even though I master Sypro (a 2000 game) in 2 days.
I have to admit druaga & phozon were never favorites when I was kid but there hoot to play now just seeing those out of date graphics, yep the graphic may be pathetic & game idea may seem simple but they are still challenging and a good reminder of what the good old days of video games were like.
