Unfortunately, the single-player is incredibly boring...just bots and skirmishes.  If there was a campaign, this game is flawless.
The multiplayer is great, and there are plenty of great modifications for this game.  But if you don't have a broadband internet connection, don't think about it.  This game revolves on a good internet connection.
