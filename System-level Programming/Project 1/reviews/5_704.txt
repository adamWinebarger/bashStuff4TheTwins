Grim Fandango combines every element you look for in an adventure game in a fluent and involving fashion.  The plot, the comedy, the political intrigues, an occasional romance...  All right here!  One of the things I found most amusing was, whenever Manny (the main character)  manages to build his life (or is it death?) up again, you (the player)  takes over and manages to ruin it in a day!  (Whew, think I got enough  parenthesis in!)  If you enjoy an easy-going adventure game with a great  story to tell, this game's for you!
