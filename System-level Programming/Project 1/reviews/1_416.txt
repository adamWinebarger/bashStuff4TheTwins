very boring game.  The graphics are the average 64 graphics that many 64 games had at the time.  Very dull textures.  Even though this game has a neat aspect of movement in every direction, it still lacks fun gameplay.  The music is very annoying and i have heard better on the SNES system quality wise.  I don't reccomend this game even if you are a collector.
