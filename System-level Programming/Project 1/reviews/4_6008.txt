One of those rare cases where a game developer doesn't compromise gameplay in favour of graphics.  Omega Boost gets the best of both worlds.  Though the 360-degree environment can make you dizzy, the addition of the "face forward" button drastically improves ease of controls.  And the backgrounds and characters look sharp but remain responsive, which makes for a great fast-paced shooter.
If anything, I might have wished there would be a little more diversity in terms of weapons, levels, missions and some kind of a story.  Imagine the customizeability of Armored Core coupled with the furious action and beautiful graphics of this game!  However, that didn't seem to be the intention of the designers.  As an old-fashioned "blow-everything-up" shooter, Omega Boost ranks among the best there is to offer.
