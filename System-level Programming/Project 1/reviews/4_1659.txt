This game is interesting.  My sister made me pick it up and it is fun to mess around with.  If you are looking for a cute little adventure platformer then this is it.  The graphics are good and the control isn't too tricky.  It does get difficult in parts but not overly.  I am not a huge fan of platform games but this one got me with its unique humorous tones.  Give it a shot on your PS2 if you haven't.  It's a bargain.
