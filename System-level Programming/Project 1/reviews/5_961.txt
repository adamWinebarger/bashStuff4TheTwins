This game is fantastic. Personally, I love it. Have you ever played a game where an evil witch is ugly and wants to be evil so she steals a beautiful girl named Tooty to try and transfer the beauty to the ugly witch? Also, have you ever played a game where a bear and bird have to collect golden puzzle pieces, musical notes, dinosaurs mixed with teddy bears named Jinjos? Also, have you ever played a game where a shaman transforms the bear and bird into various forms? Well, if you haven't, this is where to start. This game is perfect for all ages. I would recommend this game to anyone who has a N64.
