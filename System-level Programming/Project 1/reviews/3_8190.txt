This game wasn't the best game I've ever played.  It was a change though since Mario wasn't the star of this game (Mario's Story? O_o  Okay I'll shut up).  Since Yoshi was the main character, I thought it would be adorable when I saw it ...  When I brought it home to play, I sat there for hours playing it.  I thought the little Yoshi characters were just plain adorable.  Then my brother played it.  He was around 4 or 5 at the time.  He absolutely loved it.  I wasn't too impressed by it.  But, I guess this is a great game for the younger generations.  If you have a younger brother/sister/son/daughter/etc., get this game for them.  They'll have a blast.
