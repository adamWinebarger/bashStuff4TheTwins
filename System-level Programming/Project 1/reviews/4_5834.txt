4 stars because it arrived very quickly, it's a gift for my friend whose birthday is the 19th, It arrived on the 17th so I was VERY happy.. Looking at the disc because I was worried when it said "disc shows some wear from use" and sure it has some very faint scratches (like 2-3 maybe?) but I've seen deeper scratches in ps1 games and they still played. Hasn't been tested but they are obsessed with doom so they will let me know if there's any problems with the games and I will update. So far I'm very very very happy.
