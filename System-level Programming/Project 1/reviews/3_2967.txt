Bloody Roar II: The New Breed - Circa 1999

GOOD:

- Nicely Balanced old school PS1 3D fighter

- Beast change really brings something new and unique to the table

BAD:

- Graphics are dated, for today's generation

- Somewhat small staple of fighters

IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:

- Playing a Tekken/Virtual Fighter rip off where the fighters can transform into animals

-  Has some old school "dial-in-combos"

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:

- Virtual Fighter 3

- Tekken 3

- Soul Blade

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

- Bloody Roar II has almost every thing from Bloody Roar (the original) except for three fighters, besides that Bloody Roar II has everything the original had and then some

- Later Bloody Roars such as Bloody Roar 3 and 4, where not as Balanced as this one but the graphics were better
