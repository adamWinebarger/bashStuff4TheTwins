For Beetle Adventure Racing, they decided to give a 1st time player only 2 tracks to play to start with!! Otherwise, to get more tracks you have to to go to Championship Race, and get the other tracks. I look at these cheat things on the Internet, and a lot of them don't mention that you can unlock tracks, so I wanted to tell people that yes you can unlock tracks - (6 racing tracks altogether) 4 tracks plus there are these multiplayer tracks to unlock. There are more multiplayer tracks, but these are simpler. They aren't real racing tracks like the other 6. Think of them like battle games such as the ones on Mario Kart 64.

Now, some people might say 6 racing tracks (other than multiplayer, that's it?? Cruisin USA 64 has 14 tracks.. However, the 6 tracks are not normal tracks. They are about twice as long as other racing games I have played such as Destruction Derby, Cruisin USA, Monster Truck Madness 64, etc. You can play 3 laps of a course such as Coventry Coves, and you are ending it in 7-8 minutes. This is without stops, or crashes. The handling is good on this game, so you probably wouldn't crash to begin with.

Again, the only thing I really don't like is that you to win the championship races to win so much. They should have had 6 tracks they give you already + 2 extra tracks you win with the championship races, and more cars to win with the championship races. It is what it is, but it's still a fun game.
