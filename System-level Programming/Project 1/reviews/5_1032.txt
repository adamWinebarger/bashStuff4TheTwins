My weekends during high school revolved around playing this game with friends, yelling, and ingesting copious amounts of kool-aid and chips.  Maybe it's the nostalgia talking but even today this game is insanely fun to play.  Let's remember the N64.  Cartridge system, ahead of its time, player of some of the most memorable games of the past 30 years.  Mario Kart 64 is definitely one of those games.  Graphically, it was gorgeous in the 90's.  The colors are vibrant, character models are blocky(anti-aliasing wasn't cared about much back then), and the music freakin' rocked!  Game play is excellent with each racer having their own feel.  There are tons of power ups and weaponized items to truly jack up your competition which helps to create some of the most frustration last second finishes or losses probably ever.

For nostalgia's sake, get this game, pop it in, disregard that it looks blocky on a new TV, and enjoy the memories!
