Donkey Kong Land is a fairly fun game with lots of unique levels to it. Unlike the others in the Donkey Kong Land series, the levels in the game are not related to the original. They range from sky levels to city levels. Feels much more different than traditional Donkey Kong games.

The controls is my biggest gripe with this game. In every Donkey Kong game, if you press the attack button they character attacks and if you hold it you begin to run fast. It gives you a running start basically. Well, not in this game. If you press the attack button to get a fast start to jump over something, you will actually slow down almost to a stop after the attack before you can begin to run. If you jump after an attack, you will only go a few inches and fall. To jump far you need to already have had the run button held so you won't attack first.

That isn't the only problem though, because whenever you jump if feels as if some invisible weights are tied to your character. Your character gets pulled down when they jump instead of falling. The jumping in this game is horrible and makes any jump a challenge, but the worst is in the sky level.

The secrets in this game are easy to find for the most part. All you have to do is find the bonuses and KONG letters. I only ever got stuck on two levels looking for the secrets. Everything being in one color doesn't help finding them any easier.

Overall the game is a little fun but the controls are frustrating. It goes against everything you've learned from the Donkey Kong series and makes the game difficult in some levels. The game is short and only took me about 3 hours to complete 100% but for what it is, it isn't too bad, but I would not recommend it.
