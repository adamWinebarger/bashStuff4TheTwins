This game is pretty cool
The mini games are fun...I love em'..The questions are a little....eeeyy lets skip that one...The game is overall very fun...I was addicted to this game at some point....Me n' friends would have a blast playing this game...Anyone who loves South park will enjoy this game.
Though I doulbt You can get this game since it's out of print.  I guess you can get it used if you can find it.
Over all it's pretty fun but it's alittle inapropraite for little ones...
I liked it though...
Later...
