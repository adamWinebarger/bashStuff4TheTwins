Ape Escape is on one of the sleekest action games on Playstation, which is, in theory, a pretty low-power console. The graphics, despite being  rather choppy, are colorful and well-textured. Most of all, the game has a  high frame rate with no noticeable slowdown to speak of, which allows  things to move quickly and smoothly. The control scheme is intuitive  despite being complex at the outset. Fortunately, no action you can take  requires pressing more than one button. Right shoulder buttons are jumping,  left shoulder buttons center camera and bring you into a first-person  lookaround mode, digital d-pad moves the camera, left and right sticks move  the character and the selected tool respectively, which the X, triangle,  circle, and square buttons select your tool. Also, the controls are quite  tight, which will save you much frustration from falling over cliffs and  such. The camera is one of the best I've ever seen. It rarely swings around  the character, although at times I did experience a few odd, glitchy  perspectives, such as from behind walls and from under floors. Fortunately,  the camera is spring-loaded to auto-center on the character.
The level  selection is the usual cliche pretty meadows/volcanoes/robotic factory  fare, but in order to fulfill your quota of monkeys (capturing  anachronistic, and very agile monkeys is the point of the game) you will  have to navigate your surroundings in all of the three dimensions and  utilize all of your equipment (monkeys are caught with a net, enemies are  disposed of with a "force club", you can glide with a hand copter  to reach higher ground, or swim via help of a motorized sub), which is part  of the appeal. The levels are large and complex.
The game is relatively  easy, but the frantic excitement it creates will make you play it over and  over again.
