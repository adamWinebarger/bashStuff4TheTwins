I like this game a lot.
Is RTS in its most pure state.
Build your economy, set your army, go to seek & destroy!
No crappy heroes to level up!

It runs ok in my old video card a nvidia 7600,
but show some graphics issues in my new nvidia GTX275
in the menu screens but in the gameplay the graphics issues are gone.
So I have to deal with the graphics issues only in the menu screens.

After playing the StarCraft 2 beta, I can assure that Starcraft 1
is better than StarCraft 2. Not just for the LAN support that
Blizzard remove in SC2, the gameplay in SC1 is awesome.

Yeah, SC2 has better graphics than SC1 right; but a game
is about gameplay and not graphics.

Me and my friends still play SC1 in LAN-fests.
This is something we're going to miss in SC2.
