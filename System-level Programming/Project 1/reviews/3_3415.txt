I use to like this game alot when it came out. But, after trying out Street fighter 3: third strike. This game is for the original fans of the alpha series. The cool thing is now you get to choose a variation types of super styles. More modes making fun to play than the arcade. The weirdest but could be cool is the mode where you can already fight bison(vega) mode. If you beat him you get to see the ending for you chosen fighter. Why bother playing arcade mode then if you want to see every persons ending? I hate the two button idea of grabbing and two button recovery after being poped. Couldn't they just make it like the original alphas? Capcom seemed like they tried to add some street fighter 3 flavor to this game. I say it is fun if you challange your friends.
