Eternal Champions is an awesome game....for Sega CD.This version of it for Genesis is total crap. First of all,the game is almost IMPOSSIBLE to beat. You'll have one hell of a time just getting past the first fight. What makes it even worse is there is no way to adjust the difficulty level on this game neither. Another bad thing about this stinker is when you lose a match,you gotta keep hitting reset over and over again if you wanna change your fighter. This game sucks. There IS some history behind this game though. This was the very first exclusive fighting game that went straight to Genesis,and that wasn't in the arcade first. But that little history lesson doesn't save this terrible game. Oh and did I mention that you need a six button controller to play this game too?...You can play it with a three button pad,if you like to keep hitting the start button over and over again to change your punches into kicks. My best advice to you is to stay as far away from this game as you can,and pick up the Sega CD version of it.
