Before I get into anything about Quake II I have to say if you still own a Sony PlayStation or like first person shooters in general Quake II is definitely a must own! Lots of great things to say about this game...

*The levels were well designed

*Even today the graphics are pretty good as a 3D polygonal shooter

*Love the light sourcing effects that bring realism to the overall look that Quake II has

*Very smooth fluid-like gameplay and excellent use of color

Thankfully the game has some pretty tough enemies because I notice with 3D shooters you don't get huge doses of enemies like you get in the older Doom games.

So why 4-stars?
Well (sigh) I was blown away by the first Quake and there's plenty of words for it-advanced,dark,creative,or my choice of word would be primitive. Firing a nailgun at an ogre (enemy) wielding a chainsaw and chucking grenades I thought the Quake series was just going to get more grim with every future release in it's polished form. Quake II is still a noteworthy shooter but it goes towards a hi-tech,bio-organic, cybernetic experiment and does a good job at it. It's just that the Quake series didn't stick to a particular formula.
