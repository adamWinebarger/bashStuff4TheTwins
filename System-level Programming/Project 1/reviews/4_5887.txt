This was a really good MK game at the time. Heck. It still is good. It's got all the characters from Mortal Kombat-Ultimate MK3,Plus with the fatalities,friendships,babalities,ect. But there are some problems with this game. It does not include EVERY single background from the first game,like it does with MK II and MK3/UMK3. It's got the courtyard,the pit,the pit bottom and Goro's dungeon,but where are the rest??? I found that to be a major issue for me. Another problem I had with it,is alot of the backgrounds don't have the music in them,from the original games. It seems all kind of shuffled up. Lastly,another little issue is,you cannot perform a stage fatality in the pit 2,that was orginally in MK II,which IMO,was the best stage fatality out of the first three games(Including UMK3)...oh and why is Johnny Cage all of a sudden fighting with his shades on??? But Overall though,if you can overlook the little flaws,I guess this is a good game...but IMO in could have been somewhat better.
