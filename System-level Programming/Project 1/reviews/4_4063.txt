In this game you play Sonic the Hedgehog attempting to Chaos, the watery God of Destruction, from annihilating the world.  Later in the game, five additional characters are introduced into the game - each with their own style of play.
There are basically two types of levels in Sonic.  In action stages, the game behaves like any other platform game (Mario Adventure, Pandemonium, Crash Bandicoot), where you run around a 3D world along a predefined path, dodging traps, destroying enemies and collection objects.  In adventure stages, your character is allowed to free form explore - talking to characters and finding hidden objects.
There are also a couple of mini games (including a chao breeding simulation) which provide additional amusement.
The graphics are beautiful to look at and the level design is extensive and complex.  The sound effects and sound track are also very well executed, although there is no attempt to lipsynch the voiceovers.  Overall, the game is fun and has a lot of replay value.
