This is an old fashioned RPG that may not appeal to those who have only known the likes of Final Fantasy X, FFX-2, and Xenosaga.  There's not a lot of cutscenes here to help tell the story.  No fancy soundtrack.  Very little voice acting, which is a shame considering the voice actor for Ghaleon did a wonderful job. There's nothing like an elaborate prologue or ending that you got out of Xenosaga. Instead, gamers will have to depend on lots of reading and playing to make the story unfold.
Battles are quite challenging.  Basically, you plan the moves for all of your characters and then turn control over to the battle system.  There is also an option to have the battle system fight for you, but this mode is not recommended.
This game's story is very mild and shallow compared to the other RPGs mentioned above.  LSSS's strong points are definitely fighting and solving puzzles.  The story is a lightweight.  And definitely not for those looking for something along the lines of "epic".
