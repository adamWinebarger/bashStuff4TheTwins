I'm slow to give a 1-star rating, but this certainly takes it.  First, the grip is hard.  The grip it thin and small extends vertically from the controller.  The Z-Button on all three of the ones I got broke within a month after moderate use.  The controller gets greasy SO easily.  Never, ever get this, no matter how desperate you are to save money.
