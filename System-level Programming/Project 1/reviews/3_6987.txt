i never liked age of empires.i think ensemble never put much effort into it.well the video is terrible and it looks kind of glum everywhere even in daylight.the missions or campaighns were not highly interesting.well the only thing is that at times it males u think,and that cheered up the glum atmosphere.overall this is just a shadow of what age of mythology is.
