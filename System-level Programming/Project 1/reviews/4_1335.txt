I always hated the WCW. I was playing Warzone, Attitude and WWF titles for a long time. Then I somehow ended up owning this game and I inteneded to dissmiss it, but I found myself playing it more and more every day and eventualy loved it. I was happy to hear THQ got the rights to WWF and went from this to Wrestlmania and then the best game on the 64 NO MERCY. However, this is the foundation of where it started and I respect it for that. It brought a lot of awsome memorys and entertainment on hot summer nights. I recomend No Mercy over this, but this original version deserves your respect.
