I loved this game when i first played it. It has many puzzles and frustrating stuff that you have to get away from because of how hard they are. It took me 10 hours to beat the game just because the puzzle solving is very hard on normal mode. You can play an arrange game where you have unlimited ammo for a sub machine gun which is cheating but is part of the game when you first turn it on. This game is fun and challanging the first few plays with whatever character, (You can be Claire Redfield or Leon Kennedy.) but it will be a bore when you finish it.
