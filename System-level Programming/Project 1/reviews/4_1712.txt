You wouldnt expect it, but this game is good for all the wrong reasons. If you were to buy this, you wouldnt think the best wrestlers would be the the guys you never heard of right? By far the best finishing move in the game is called "The Alcapulco" by some guy whos name I cant remember. Its the most devastating move ive ever seen in wrestling, if he does this in real life to other people, I would suspect these people often become paralyzed.
I will attempt to describe the move, it starts off as a regular suplex, but once he has the guy verticle in the air, he releases him and comes down into a piledriver. So basicaly your being dropped directly on your head from 6+ ft in the air. A regular piledriver is like 2 ft and you have almost no momentum. Same with a tombstone piledriver. This tops both by alot.
Besides this one move, the game is average overall, not great, not bad. But this one thing made it better than average for me, worth a look in my opinion.
