If you're a fighting game fan (and don't need an arcade stick), you basically need a pad with six buttons, and this is the only good choice. It's easy to program (and comes preset to most Capcom games anyway), and the analog stick is much firmer than the Sega one (also good), but unfortunately anybody with small hands will HATE this. It's really big, and the buttons are laid out badly (instead of repositioning the original 4, they stuck on Z and C). The D-pad is very nice, but the buttons don't go down easily. All in all, though, if you absolutely must have the extra two buttons (which you do for most Capcom stuff) this is the best option next to an arcade stick. Otherwise, don't bother.
