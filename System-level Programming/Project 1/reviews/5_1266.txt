posibly the best game i ever played !
this game is great, u may think u should just rent it, but dont.
This game is so long it took me bout 2 months to pass it.
there is a great storyline.
i played all of HL games and this is the best one.
for example in half life 1 u get to a radio, and a soldier says there to retreat. if u play opposing forse ull see this guy saying same thing to abort and same voice.
great story line, great wepons, great multiplayer.
trust me ull never get tired of this game.
GET THE GAME!!!
P.S.: you won't regret this.
