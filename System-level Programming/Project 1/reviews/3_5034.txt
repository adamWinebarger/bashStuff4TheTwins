My almost 5-year-old and I got hooked playing Spyro 3 earlier this month. We've been playing endlessly. To take a little break we tried out Toy Story 2. What a disappointment. I don't think the graphics are that great, unless you're comparing them to a Super Nintendo. And the games are MUCH harder to play. We couldn't figure out what we were supposed to do in some rooms, and the skill required to complete most of the tasks is just beyond my youngster and I.
My other complaint would be with the help/instructions on-screen. In Spyro, the characters read aloud the messages as they appear on the screen. This means he can play the game by himself. But because he can't read, he can't get help or hints on-screen.
While he does seem to like it because of the characters, he just can't play it by himself, and his frustration level is pretty high with this one. Not to sound like a broken record, but if you've got a younger child, try Spyro 3 (or 2 or 1).
