I don't know how many times I've played this game from start to finish.
Like a lot of people my decision to buy a N64 was based on the Mario 64 commercials.
The WOW factor was in full effect.
When I got home and started playing it literally felt like the first time I experienced Atari or the Sega Genesis.
Blown away would be an understatement.

The game itself?
Perfection even with a few minor things.

The good.
M64 ushered in a whole new age of platforming.
Brought us 3D platfroming that was just about perfect in every way.
The graphics for it's time were second to none.
The control was spot on.
The story line was simple but cute like all Mario games.
Hidden secrets like being able to wall jump up to the roof.
I could go on and on.......

The bad?
My only gripe is the camera.
The camera can get quite wonky in places and funny...even to this day bad cameral angles still plague 3D games.
Nintendo and other companies have for the most part gotten the camera down with the free moving camera feature. Too bad some companies are still completely clueless.

To summarize.
Perfection.
Groundbreaking.
A legend that spawned a thousand imitators, some good, most...not so good.
Can't beat the original.
Highest recommendations.
