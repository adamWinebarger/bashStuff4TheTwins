this game gets a lot of great reviews, and i guess almost ten years ago, this game was considered cutting edge with RPGs for PCs. i only bought this game two months ago, and i feel it's only okay. the graphics are a bit bland, which creates problems because sometimes your character will have to find something in the game environment but since so much on the screen is either shadowed or looks the same, it's hard to spot important things. also, the AI can be maddeningly frustrating. you "control" a group of about five players, but they'll do the most ridiculous things, like running into danger, standing and simply getting hit, not attacking. this becomes a serious issue towards the end of the game when you have to fight a lot and need your characters to be on point instead of doing things which specifically gets them hurt and killed. overall, this game is okay, the storyline is okay. it's just a blah sort of game.
