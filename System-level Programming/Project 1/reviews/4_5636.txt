This was a decent game.  Probably one of the first of its kind, so that gets it major points.  It's a little on the short side (5 hours total if you watch all the cinematics and take your time) and the difficulty takes dramatic leaps and falls throughout the game, making adaptation difficult.  The graphics are absolutely horrible, but maybe i'm just spoiled by my ps2.  The voice quality isn't bad for a game as old as this one and the moves and strategy you can use are all immensely helpful (as opposed to some games that give you neat moves that have absolutely no application in the game).  Very original.
