I liked this game. In my mind this really isn't a Kids game though. to beat the game 100% actually requires alot of time and effort. Its more the type of game you can play and kids will watch. The controls are pretty easy. its basically MARIO but your a crocodile exploring diffrent levels, theres really nothing groundbreaking.

The game does keep your attention and you will have fun completing the levels. A good game if your a patient person, if not youll wonder why its taking you so long to beat this"kids" game and make you feel stupid.
