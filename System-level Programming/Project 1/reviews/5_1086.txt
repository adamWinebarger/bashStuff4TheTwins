Excellent game all around except one thing....
The game CHEATS.
You can be in first place and magically all the computer controlled racers somehow manage to catch up to you anyway.
Now, if you're in last place you literally have no chance of catching up.
Not fair.
Not cool.
That aside....if you develop your skills you'll still win.
After much practice I still managed to beat the game even though it blatantly cheats.

Great graphics.
Every character you love from the Mario universe.
I think Toad is my favorite, when he gets hit LOL. The noise he (it?) makes is hilarious.
The courses are inventive and enjoyable.
The music fits in perfectly.

Did I mention it cheats?
That's my only complaint.
Otherwise another five star winner from Nintendo.
Highly recommended.
