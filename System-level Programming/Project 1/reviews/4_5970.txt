Throughout the games of Midway's length, many of theirvideo games were straight from the arcades,whether it was Mortal Kombat, or NFL Blitz. Nevertheless it was very rare to have a video game to come straight from the shelves, that wasn't from the arcades. That answer came through with the release of Rush 2.
The 1998 video game was made exclusively for the Nintendo 64, and not upon any other console. Ironically, the prequel, San Fransisco Rush, was made on both the N64, and the Playstation. The game features many exciting and enduring automobiles through the streets of some of the biggest cities in America, including New York City, Los Angeles, and Hawaii. The game also includes the infamous Alcatraz prison, a hidden course from the previous Rush. Many fans were shocked to know why the game wasn't on any of the other consoles at the time. The sales for the Playstation version of Rush were just awful, and Midway chose to put this only on Nintendo 64.
While many people stopped purchasing Nintendo 64 games, Rush 2 remains as an absolute delight for any racer in the world. If you're looking for a reved up time, Rush 2 is that game for you.
