Super Mario 64 is a great game and is what I would call the best platforming game of all time.

PROS
+ Memorable music and imaginative courses.
+ Game play is always straightforward and never confusing.
+ 120 stars to collect for long playing time.
+ Graphics were great back when it was made, and is not painful to look at now.

CONS
- While this game does have replay value, you aren't compelled to play again after you beat it. Give it a while and you will definitely want to play again.

This game was not too hard for me, and I beat it when I was in the single-digits as a child. That given, it shouldn't be too hard for any age. Buy this game now if you haven't ever played it, since it is one of those video games you have to beat.
