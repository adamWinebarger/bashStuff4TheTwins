Almost every Dreamcast game supports the jump pack feature.  This is because the feedback mechanism adds an extra dimension of fun and interactivity to games.  If you are wondering if it is worth the [price] to add this to your controller - yes it is.
My only complaint is that the jump pack should have been built into the original controller.  This feature is near standard in all games and it seems like a crass money grab by Sega to force you to buy a second device.
I have not tried all of the jump pack devices.  However, I have tried the TremorPak and the Dreamcast device.  I can't really tell a difference other than that the TremorPak seems to vibrate a little stronger than the Dreamcast device.  As far as compatibility is concerned, it has worked in all of my games...it has my vote.
