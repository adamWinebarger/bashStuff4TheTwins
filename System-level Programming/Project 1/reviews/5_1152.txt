This game, for all that it was, was fun, exciting and enjoyable.  While some aspects of it are repetative, it is fun, and I had a blast.
You are a monster tamer, in the tradition of your father.  You must make your way deeper and deeper into the mysterious tower near town, to find fortune and achieve your destiny.  Each trip into the tower puts you at the beginning -- but your animals retain their skills.  You also can keep weapons and other items you find, but if you die, they are lost.
It is at least worth a rental if not a buy.  I give it five stars because it kept me very entertained, and I have been disenchanted with most of the SquareSoft games lately.  This really picked my spirits up.  If you don't mind a bit of repetition, you might not find this so bad.
You are also given quests to find objects in the tower, as well as the opportunity to build up and improve almost every building in your village.  Perhaps the best, and most amusing part, is how several women vie for your attentions, and you have to find the particular way to make them fall for you.
Not necessarily replayable, but great for at least a test drive.
