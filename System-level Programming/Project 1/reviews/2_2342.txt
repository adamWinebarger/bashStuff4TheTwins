It's a shame that the Sega Saturn didn't succeed in North America the way that it did in Japan because they received the Arcade perfect version of this game for the Saturn and to this date there still is not an Arcade perfect version of this game for any home console. You could probably find someone selling a Japanese Sega Saturn on eBay or something, but that's a lot of trouble and who wants to buy an entire foreign system just to play just one great game (and maybe X-Men vs. Street Fighter too!)?

As far as the PlayStation version goes, you are forced to select only one fighter and an assisting teammate due to the PlayStations lack of RAM and VRAM (the Japanese Sega Saturn version requires a packed-in 4 MB RAM Cartridge which allows the game to play exactly like the Arcade version with minimal load times). However there is a trick if you are playing a 2 player game! If both players select the same characters, then you are able to play the game the way it was meant to be played: 2 vs. 2 tag-team! This game plays almost exactly like the previous years X-Men vs. Street Fighter on PlayStation with some new features and different characters. If you liked the way the PlayStation port of Marvel Super Heroes played then you will like this even better since it is more of the same with more character variety and more colorful graphics. Aside from the cutbacks in gameplay style and missing frames of animation (another downside to the PlayStations lack of RAM!), this game is enjoyable enough if you aren't obsessed with the Arcade verion too much. I would still go for the Japanese Sega Saturn version since it is Arcade perfect or wait (and hope) for Capcom to release a Marvel Anthology or another Capcom Arcade Classics compilation with X-Men: Children of The Atom, Marvel Super Heroes, X-Men vs. Street Fighter, this game, Marvel vs. Capcom and Marvel vs. Capcom 2. C'mon Capcom!!!!!!
