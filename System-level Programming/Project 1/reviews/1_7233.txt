This is the most meager cash-in attempt I've ever seen. There may well be hundreds of questions, but it'll take you a thousand games to see them all. I was receiving a couple or three repeat questions by the fifth game, and a  majority of repeats by game 10. There seems to be little or no gradual  increase in difficulty, which was proven when I saw a $500 question later  repeated as a $125,000 question later in the game.
An example of the  game's inadequacy runs thusly: I am cruising through the game easily until  the $32,000. Fine, by now I'm expecting them to be tough. I use the 50-50,  then the call a friend, who says she is 75% certain the answer is (A). Just  to be sure, I use the audience poll as well. Guess what, 92% say that (A)  is their choice. Well, now I'm convinced and go with (A) as well. I'm  WRONG, it's (B). That is just stupid beyond measure. If they wanted to  throw me off, make the audience rating more like 60-40% or  something.
Nice graphics, nice sounds, atrocious game mechanics. Wait for  the improved version, or play it on the net.
