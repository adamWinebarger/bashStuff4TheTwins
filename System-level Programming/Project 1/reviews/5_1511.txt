Here's a cool trick!(you have to have the 2nd key you get from Bowser)
Topic:Snowman has your hat
Sent in from:Anubis
Get your blown off by the big snowman. Don't pick your hat up at all. Instead go get a star (It dosn't have to be a new star)and save and turn off N64. Wait 10 seconds.....now turn N64 back on.
Go back to that level and one of the little snowmen that pops out of the snow will have Mario's hat on their head.
