SSB is an original fighter that is always fun to play. It has four unlockable characters, one unlockable arena, and some other secerets. The only bad part is it is a little to easy(even on very hard). But this game is addicitive. Short Version: Graphics: 4.4 Sound: 4.2 Control: 4.3 Fun Factor: 4.7 Total: 4.4
