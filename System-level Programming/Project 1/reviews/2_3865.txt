I bought the dreamcast with high hopes. Mostly because of Street fighter and sonic games. The only good games are Sonic Adventure 2 and Dead or Alive 2. Sega has made systems that all have failed. Like the recent Saturn. For the first couple of days its good.
Cons:
Very Loud
Not may places to rent games
Not many games
Not many demo disks
Pros:
Good Graphics
Easy Controls
Easy to hook up
Easy to hall around
Overall the dreamcast stinks. If your looking for a system with fair graphics,lots of games,good games,easy control i'd buy the playstation.
