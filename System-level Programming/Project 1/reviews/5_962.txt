If Mario 64 was good than Banjo was Mario perfected.
Amazing game.
Another gem from years ago that I played start to finish multiple times.
Amazing levels.
Perfect control.
Great but hokey music.

Some people were annoyed by the "voices".
I thought they were hilarious.
The camera does get a little crazy here and there but this was 3D platforming in it's beginning and really, the camera is about as perfect as a 3D platforming camera can be.

To summarize...
Great gameplay.
Awesome graphics for the time.
An ending riddle that had me looking for a way in for weeks on end.
(A real bummer that the two games DIDN'T link after all).
That's probably the biggest disappointment that all those mystery areas were never revealed by the N64.
Otherwise....another great platformer from the golden age of platforming, collect a thons.
Highly recommended.
