I had big worries about this game.  I used to play the old point and click adventures of indy and I was worried that, like its predisecors this would be insanley difficult.  Thankfully it is not.  I am a bad puzzle solver and luckily, (With the exception of the pyramid of the sun dial puzzle) none of the puzzles are that hard.  The graphics are quite nice and the levels are gigantic and tempt lots of exploration.  All of the characters are well done and interesting.  The music is nice and you have a lot of neat weapons to choose from.  However this game does have some flaws.  First off, sometimes you will be walking around wondering what the heck you are supposed to be doing.  Second, some of the enviorments are way too big.  The third and biggest flaw is that the last levels are way out of place.  The 2nd to last is strange but acceptable, but the last level is wayyyy out of place.  The last flaw is that the ending is really dissapointing.  Overall this is a fun game that will take up a lot of your time and is definatly one of the better Lucasarts titles.
