This game was good but not great. It was the very first MVC game and started the ball rolling. I had this game for the Dreamcast and played it the arcade for awhile. I thought it was pretty cool but just like XMen vs SF or Marvel vs SF., but the difference was that people could call out special assists characters. I give credit though for starting the idea of having 3 on 3 matches in MVC2.
