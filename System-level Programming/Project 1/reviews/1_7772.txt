Not as advertised. My wife was scammed the same way when she bought me 2 controllers as a gift. THEY ARE NOT NINTENDO CONTROLLERS. It doesn't match up to the yellow & green N64 official controllers I have. They have a grey connector not the blue as in the picture (meaning it's a knock-off). I am not bothered about buying knock-offs but do not assume this is a nintendo controller. Will work fine sometimes and not others.
Simply, not good enough.
