I'm what gamers call a "Zelda Veteran" , I've played almost ALL of the Zelda games and managed to beat only one: this one.  I love the Zelda games because they are challenging, different and fun to play.
  In this one, Link lives in a forest with the forest folk.  Link is soon inside the Deku Tree to defeat the evil monsters that moved into the tree.  After a battle with the queen spider, the Deku Tree sadly dies and tells Link to find Zelda, the Princess of Hyrule.
  Hyrule is a kingdom that's always in trouble, and its up to Link to save the land from a terrible enemy.  Link has the help of Navi, a fairy that gives you advice or tells you what you should do next.
  During his adventures, Link will learn spells, be swallowed by a huge fish, and saving the land from the evil Ganondorf.  This game is a classic and worth the money.
