I played this game when it first came out at a friends house but i never bought it. I was not that in to the 64 back then. But now i think it is very fun and entertaning. The graphics r good for the 64, including that it was the first game ever for it. That is why almost everyone who has a 64 has this game. If u take the snes newest games graphics compared to this game, which is only a couple years apart, these graphics seem life like. It has a great adventure but its weird that Luigi is not in this game. It adds much more new items,charecters,and levels. I like that it is first person view unstead of the side view like on the past marios. Ever since this game most marios have been first person view. This is why i want sm64 ds, it is like the 64s but different graphics and differnent layouts. I will get the ds one in the future but thats a different story. Like i said, my top favorite game today.
