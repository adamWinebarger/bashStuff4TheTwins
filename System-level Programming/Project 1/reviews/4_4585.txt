This game is one of the best out there. You don't need a supercomputer. In fact this is one game where the requierments will let it run just fine. Pros: very addictive, fun, realistic, low requierments. Cons: very easy, time consuming(there are time limits, but you need to wait until the time expiers-very annoying). Overall this game is well worth the money, expesaly if you buy loopy landscapes (the expainsion)
