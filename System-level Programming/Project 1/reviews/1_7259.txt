The game boy port of Mortal Kombat was just awful! The music and graphics were decent,but the gameplay was super slow,there was absolutley NO blood OR sweat like in the SNES version,and the fatalities were just dumb. Another bad thing,for ME anyway,was there is no Johnny Cage in this version,who was one of my favorite characters from the first game. The only good MK game for game boy was MK II.Just pass this one up. It sucks.
