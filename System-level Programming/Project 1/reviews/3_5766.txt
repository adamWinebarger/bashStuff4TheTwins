Grand Theft Auto 2 - Circa 1999

GOOD:

- A better version of the original

- Sort of fun and different in it's own way

BAD:

- Really dated graphics, even for its day

- Gameplay is pretty old and controls can be tough for some

WILL IT FIT YOUR TASTE:

- A Top-down run and gun game where you steal cars, kill people, and live a life of crime

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:

- Grand Theft Auto

- Grand Theft Auto: London 1969

- The legend of Zelda: A link to the past (but a lot more urban and violent)

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

- There is a version of this game for Dreamcast, with slightly better graphics

- There is a version for this game for the PC
