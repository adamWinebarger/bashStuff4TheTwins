I have played many many many video games in my life, and this game is literally the best game that I have ever played in my life. It's nice and long (like all the other Zelda games) It has a perfect level of difficulty, there are so many different weapons in the game, there are so many memorable dungeons and fields in the game, well, I could go on forever. I wish I could give this game a higher score than the measly 5-star rating Amazon.com forces me to give but alas, i cannot. If you own a Nintendo 64, BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW! If you don't own an N64, you can still buy it for gamecube, it's the same exact game. I own it for both N64 and Gamecube. If you like this game, then buy the sequel too! It's called Majora's mask. I'm telling you, you will definetly not regret buying this game if you are a die-hard Zelda fan... Or even if you are not a die-hard Zelda fan. Although I don't know who would be reading a review of a game that was made in nineteen ninety-something, in 2007... IF YOU ARE READING THIS, BUY THIS GAME RIGHT NOW, AND IF YOU DON'T YOU ARE MISSING OUT!!  Everything about this game is perfect!... That is all.
