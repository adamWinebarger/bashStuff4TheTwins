ill start with the goods first of all its nice having this little gadget for ur N64 for games like The Legend of Zelda:Majoras Mask that requires u to have it and Perfect Dark where u practically need it to get the most out of the gameplay now the few bad things its a little difficult to get out the original jumperpak with the cheap plastic thingy they give you and for some of the games there aren't much improvements with it they have pretty much the same graphics as the jumperpak but with like hydro thunder then u can have 4 players instead of 2 or 3 (i forget which 1 it is cause i don't own the game i just saw the reviews off of nintendo magazines
