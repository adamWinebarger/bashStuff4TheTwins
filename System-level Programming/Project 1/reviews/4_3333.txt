I must say, this game is great. I have written another review for this game, but i didn't feel it was completey correct. One thing was it is confusing and I cant say its for everyone, i say this because if you don't like FF and you haven't tried FF before don't start here. The game is fun,but not good graphics, and its confusing. Yu may not like this game,I warn you.
