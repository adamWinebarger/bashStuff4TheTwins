Unless you still have a PS 1 and like it, the game sucks. Bought it for my Son(5) and playing it on a PS2.
It's very anoying to have only the option to use U/D/L/R to moove in the game. No joistick(L3) use at all.
It may be a very nice Game but the controller use make it suck. Comon, we are in 2011. It may be my bad do not know more about PS1 use, still, if I had read a review about that I wouldnt had bought the game. My Son played TY2 all the way trought with some help of me. We are not big gamers but like jump n' run games.
So, please be aware of the controller use limit. The game will en up in the corner. Very sad, shipping and the item it self where very good. Hope the TY1 is better(is in the Mail). LOL, yes, lots of old games but my son is 5, so let him scratch or kill the game on accitent, same as the PS2, it's not a big Deal. But for now it helps him to learn to handle games and take care of stuff. And the games are cheap, since some PPL always think they have to have the Newest. Thanks to those, like this we have fun for less.
Sincerely,
