I've loved all of the Mechwarrior games, they are always so easy: stand and pick other Mechs off at extreme long range. Besides graphics changes the two big changes are a nice zooming rectile, to make those long-range shots easier and a "Mobile Field Base" that will fix you up in the middle of a mission. All of this makes the campaign short, just 10 hours or so.
I had one glaring problem, it wouldn't install or run on Windows 2000. Maybe I could have gotten it to run if I had hunted down and hand-installed all the files. It ran without a single hitch on Windows 98SE.
