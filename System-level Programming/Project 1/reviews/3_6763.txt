This game is really great, despite one or two "little" problems.  The plot, the characters, the vision of the future...  One of the few movie sequel-type games that uses its name to the fullest.  Even if you haven't seen the movie, this game's well worth the $$ for anyone who likes a  well-formed adventure story.  This game claims to be real time, but it's  not really (at least in the sense of The Last Express and other well-formed  real time adventure games).  Still, it's really fun, and you usually do  things at your own pace.  This makes this particular game more fun and  enjoyable than its real time counterpart could ever be.  I think the only  major mistake this game has is that it's too darn hard to get any of the  endings you haven't already seen.  After you've seen one, you've probably  seen all of the ones you can reasonably access without changing your  playing habits way too much.  And, some of the prerolled aspects of the  game (i.e., who's a Replicant and who's not) are completely random  (obviously, they're **prerolled**), and therefore you could get the same  ending over and over and **over** again without knowing why.  And, no, this  is not an exaggeration.  I've probably played the game five times, and I've  only seen three of (supposedly) seven endings.  One of these endings was so  revolting I couldn't bear to watch it (not violence wise, more... plain old  disgusting wise; you'll know it when you see it).  All three of these  endings were available through different paths the first time I played, so  I just saved and saw them all the **first** stinking time.  Anyway, I keep  playing it again and again to see the other endings, and, frankly, it gets  old.
To conclude, it's a good game, and, if you can bear playing it  about a billion times, you can take advantage of all the annoyingly hard to  get endings.
