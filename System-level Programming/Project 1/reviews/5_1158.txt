(Note:This is the Gamecube Collectors Edition version)I remember ten years ago,seeing the commercial for this game. I always did wonder what it was like. After getting the collectors edition I immediately got started on it. The story focuses,as always,on Link. Link is a young boy living in the Kokiri Forest. One night he has a nightmare,and wakes to discover a fairy named Navi,who will help him through his journey. He is overjoyed but then discovers that the gaurdian of Kokiri Forest,the Great Deku Tree,is dying from a curse. The tree passes along a Spiritual Stone and recommends to see Princess Zelda. Link does so and Zelda tells him to get the other two spiritual stones so Link can get the Master Sword to stop Ganon,King of the Gerudos,from entering the Sacred Realm and stealing the Trifoce,a divine relic. Link achieves the other stones and the Ocarina of Time. Link draws the Sword and finds out he has been tricked by Ganon,who entered the Sacred Realm. Link awakens seven years later,and after discovering he is now an adult,meets Rauru the Sage of Light. According to Rauru,the only way to defeat Ganon is to awaken the Five Sages. That is where the true quest begins. Wow,what a story! Now,the graphics are not bad by today's standards. Neither are the dungeons. They are amazing. And also very complicated.(Please don't mention the Water Temple).Overall this game can be summed up by one word:Perfect. Buy the game,become the hero,and have the time of your life.
