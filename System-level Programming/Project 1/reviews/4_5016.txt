Yes, Fallout 2 is one of the best RPG games out there, especially considering the fact that there are no futuristic RPG's in the current market.  However, this game requires way to much search and talk.  It gets  very old very quickly, and you will find yourself with the best equipment  on the planet by simply waiting for two different parties to kill each  other.  I had a flamethrower within one hour of playing that made me nearly  invincible.  I mean, come on.  Unless you are going to play this game  without accepting help from NPC's, this really proves no challenge and  damages the fun factor.  At least the price is right.
