This game was immense.  The sheer volume of options in character development was overwhelming.  If you want a game on a grand scale, this is the one for you.  The storyline is very good and the skill system was a  very good idea.  Characters are not developed enough, but interaction  between them was interesting, especially the way that it affected the game.  The final battle is unfairly difficult.  It requires more skill than luck  to complete.  Replay value is probably this games greatest attribute.  Because the game is so affected by your actions, it can be very different.  Also, there are a wide variety of characters that you can use.  These  things combined with the skill system can make this into a somewhat  different game each time you play it.  If you are not short on patience,  this can be a very fun game with a lot of replay value.
