Great game.  This was the first Zelda game I ever played and what an adventure it was.  If you like your game worlds big with plenty to explore you'll love this game.  You'll be putting a lot of hours in during your first play through and probably still won't find all that's hidden throughout its worlds.  This is a Nintendo masterpiece and easily one of the best games I've ever played.
