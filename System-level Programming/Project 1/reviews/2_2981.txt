I can see why this game was so hyped in 1993.  CD-ROMs were cutting edge and the "slideshow" graphics are fairly good and so is the sound.  However, the story isn't as interesting as the ambiance would have you think and the movement is absolutely, irritatingly choppy.
I don't believe anyone has ever finished this game without some help.  There is too much slow clicking around and backtracking to keep the attention of even the dullest person.
I don't like having to resort to hints in order to play a game because it's released before the necessary technology is truely ready.
REALmyst?...I no longer care. Riven and Myst3?...even more clue-less and annoying, I'm sure.
