First, get this straight. If you're one of those Nintendo owners who invites all their buddies over to have a go at Goldeneye, Mario Party, Beetle Adventure Racing and all those other multiplayer classics, Super Smash is the game for you. Unless one of your friends has it. You see, Super Smash doesn't really achieve much in the single player adventure. This is due to the fact that it simply isn't fun to beat up people by yourself. Who are you going to taunt and yell at? The television screen? I'll give you some inside information: it won't yell back. The levels and characters get tedious and boring really really fast. But as a multiplayer romp, Super Smash achieves all that a fighting game can. It is fun, but only in groups.
