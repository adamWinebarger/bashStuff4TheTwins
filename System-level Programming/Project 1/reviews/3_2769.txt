I really don't understand why this game gets such a high rating. I mean all it is is an exact duplicate of the 1985 NES version converted to the Game Boy with a few extra modes of gameplay and extras added into it. I suppose for those who were to young and have not experienced the 8 bit Nintendo days it is good for them to experience the game too. But lets face it if there is any game that most video gamers have played at some point in there lives Super Mario Bros for the Nes is it. All this Game Boy version is is a fine conversion of the first Super Mario Bros to the handheld console and not much more. Great for kids that are young now though who missed out on the Nintendo 8 bit days.
