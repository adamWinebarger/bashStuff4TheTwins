I still play this game, you if you're a first person shooter, you should understand why. Doom is still a classic killing game, despite the fact that it is an older and out dated play style, bested by the newer and hotter lines such as Call of Duty:Modern Warfare and others like them. However, I still like this game for 3 reasons.... Bazookas, BFG2000, and the willies!! Yes, the spine tingling you get when your stare too long at the screen while playing Doom and the music creeps you out some much you need to pause the game to turn on the lights!!

So, turn out the lights, load that BFG, and blast some hell knights!!
