This is the very first twisted metal game to come out and i loved it. It is different than the rest of them but it is still fun to play. It has the original people and tracks to go to so if u have played any of the other twisted metal games u will reconize most of these people. It is very hard to beat because it is the first game and it took a long time to get used to. The graphics well this is the first one, its on the ps1, and it is a very old game so yes they r not very good. It is all blocky and the cars move in weird directions. This is a great game on multiplayer though, there r many different things to do unstead of just battleing each other. After u beat the game a couple of times it is easy to play and beat ur friends at it. This is a very fun but challenging game.
