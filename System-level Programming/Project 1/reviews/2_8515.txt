This game plays ok, but Nintendo caved to media pressure and edited most of the best content out of the game.  This game feels neutered.  It is like buying a music album you really like from a great artist only to find out you bought the radio edit version instead of the explicit version.  Granted a lot of games that were ported from an arcade console to the SNES system had to be altered to fit the parameters of the system, but this game could have left in the gore and everything else.  This is one of those rare times where Sega got it right and Nintendo goofed it up.  One of my favorite parts of the game was playing against other people and ripping off their heads at the end of a battle.  None of that in this version.  I feel like it should have a Care Bears sticker on it or something to let  buyers know this is the G rated version.

There is still some slow lag issues in the game and some bugs here and there.  The play control has some issues it does not seem fluid.  I would stick to only playing this game in the arcade for the true overall experience, that way you can see why everyone enjoyed it so much.  The endurance rounds provide a nice challenge that would be the only thing this game does better than MK2.  Other than that the sequel was superior in every way.  Seeing the classic characters is nostalgic and brings back a lot of memories.
