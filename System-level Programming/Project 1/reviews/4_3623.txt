Around 1999 this game hit shelves on the coat tails of the success of the famed Resident Evil series. It even comes with a demo for Resident Evil 3 Nemesis! That said, this is not Resident Evil. It has similar controls and a story a little too silly to understand, but that is it.

The game is dependant on your ability to craft darts or find bullets to kill the enemys of the game. You will never have enough ammo to march through the compound and kill every enemy. You will need to run, close doors, operate lazer gates, and ect to get through this game.

There are puzzles as well, none that I can immediately remember except for the puzzle where you move cargo holds to make a path.

The enemies are excellent. This game has dinosaurs that look and feel like Jurrasic Park dinosaurs. The raptors are vicious and terrifying, the pterradactyles are a situational enemy but they are a thrilling challenge, the dome-headed dinosaurs show up and kick your can, and the Tyrannosaurus Rex is simply great. The enemys are so well used in the game that they are completely plausable. They take a great deal of damage and are fast and strong enough to rip you apart.

I give this game praise for going away from the zombie threat and replacing them with something exceedingly more violent and threatening. I love zombie games more than the next guy, but this was just good. The story was B-Movie, just like in Resident Evil, and the enemys were terrifying and threatening. The enviroments were dynamic and look really good on PS1. Very little did not work in the game, and if ther was something then I cannot remember it.
