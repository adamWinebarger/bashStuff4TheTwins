the installation took a bit of work, youtube video's help quite a bit.
but what the video I watched DID NOT MENTION, is that if you replace your touch screen with this, then you'll see a very noticeable silver boarder around your screen, that is from the LCD panel it's self.
you'll need your old screen, SO DON'T TROW it out yet, you'll need to pry off the plastic black square (carefully) and place it on your new touch screen.
With this installed, the black square will cover up the silver boarder, and make your tablet look just like when it was fresh out of the box!
