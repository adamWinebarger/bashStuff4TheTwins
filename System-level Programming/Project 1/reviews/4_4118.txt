NFL 2K is a great game for the money--....  You'll have a lot of fun playing.  The graphics are great.  The gameplay is simple and good.  I think it's playable even for someone who does not know football but wants to play this game b/c of its raved reviews. The play diagrams tell where the players are going, doing, and the players in play are tagged with control button icons so you know exactly whom your QB has to pass the ball. It's great for beginners as well as experienced players.  The only problem I see is the inability for a second player to call timeouts.  This is actually a BIG problem. That's why it gets 4 stars instead of 5.
