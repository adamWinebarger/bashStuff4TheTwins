I stand behind this game being the best Super Mario game nintendo has produced. Too bad it was on a system that people didn't enjoy - too many complaints over the control and the game selection and graphics capability it was a true underdog. But Super mario 64 has so many good qualities

this game takes forever to beat. Some may think this is a nusance but its filled with many many wonderful levels of fun

each level is unique and its organized in a wonderful fashion, you never get too confused in nagivating the game

There is ALWAYS something new to find, and many races and somewhat minigames that are actually entertaining and not ultimately annoy you.

You get frusterated when you lose, you realize this isn't some easy game  you can breeze through, its actually difficult - appreciate that challenge because challenge is hard to come by in games these days.

Graphics aren't overdone. Good, you can find flaws, especially these days, the angles may alert some gamers as being old fashioned, but think about it like this... its not 2D. lol.

Overall, I love this game. Without a doubt, I consider it amongst the top 3 of my favorite games. If you haven't played this game, you are really missing out on something, go play it, you'll see how fun and exciting this game can be. and believe me - it only gets better.
