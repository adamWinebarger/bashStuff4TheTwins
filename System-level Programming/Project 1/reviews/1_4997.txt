This game is nothing more than a sick joke.  Really the story absolutely sucks (what motivates one through twenty hours of gameplay?), the humor tries to be funny but comes across as stale, the environment is tedious and boring, the difficulty is Schizophrenic i.e. hikes constantly especially when you fight against the Enclave.  It's like the game itself is a parody of the original Fallout.  If you want a masterpiece of a game, buy the original Fallout instead of this junk.
