This is an excellent game! Once you start playing you cannot stop until you actually beat it! This has averythingn a GOOD game should have: Excellent graphics, excellent gameplay, good
2-player mode, and good sound. The only flaw in this game is... well... their are no flaws, this game gets a SOLID 5. Thanks for reading my review. Happy Gaming. P.S. Don't buy Pokemon Snap... Thanks!
