This is a retro game - no way around it.

However, I actually enjoy retro games.  I actually just got done playing Another World and Fallout 1 & 2 on my laptop.

Having been playing alot of Desktop Tower Defense games lately, I thought I would upgrade to a true RTS game.  Starcraft kept coming up high on everyone's favorite list, so I thought I'd give it a try.

The Good:
- This really is a fun game.  I'm only on level 9 (out of 30) on the original, but it's fun.  Level 8 took me about 4 hrs to finally beat.  But some of this is because there's no instructions in the game (see The Bad).  After reading the strategy guide for the level I finally figured out what I needed to do.  However, I had fun playing the whole time without getting discouraged.
- The graphics aren't all that bad.  I was expecting much worse.  Though they're not bad, they're not great either.  About the same as Fallout 1.  I am surprised they haven't been improved by a patch.
- No Easy/Medium/Hard setting.  I actually prefer to NOT have an Easy/Medium/Hard setting.  On some games my first instinct is to pick Medium, but then I will often get stuck or find it's too easy.  And then I wish I had picked something different.  This game, you have to really be strategic.  Some levels may be too easy and some may be pretty darn hard.  If they're hard simply refer to the guide.  Which brings up another point.  you don't have to keep playing a level until you demolish the CPU.  You just need to win.  I tried out Middle Earth RTS and your people carry over.  I got a few levels in and couldn't beat the level.  After hitting a forum, I found out it's impossible to win if you didn't max out your army from the previous levels.

The Bad:
-  Video.  I run this on my laptop and the screen turns black and the game starts in the upper left part of the window consuming only about 25% of my widescreen laptop.  The rest of the screen is black.  It's pefectly playable, but awefully small.  However, I noticed that when I put my laptop in my docking station connected to an external monitor it goes full-screen.  Of course full-screen on a 24" widescreen monitor is not good for this game either.  No amount of tweaking to the shortcut seemed to help.  The only option is to change the desktop resolution to 800x600 before starting the game which is a major pain.  Some Googling and it seems most everyone with a widescreen laptop experiences this.  They all refer to a freeware download that let's you run Starcraft in a window.  This actually works VERY nice, and was surprised at how much I liked it compared to the smaller screen in the upper left.  However, there's comments from some users that after using the program, some people have been banned from Battle. Net since it saw they were using a 3rd party program with Starcraft.  I'm not interested in playing SC on Battle.net so that's not a huge deal for me.  But really, if you're going to actively sell a game at the game shops, you would think this would be fixed by Blizzard.  It's one thing if I found this at a used/discount store, but I didn't.  Also, I'm surprised Blizzard hasn't released a patch to smooth out the graphics a bit.  It's not horrible, but it's hard to imagine that it would be too hard to fix it up a little better with a patch.  Many other games have patches that improve the graphics.  Doom, Quake to name a couple.
- No instructions.  Really.  No instructions.  The strategy guide helps, and the first levels help give you a feel for the game, but really?  No instructions?  This is part of what hurt me on level 8.  I wanted to beat it without having to read the strategy guide.  In the end, the guide told me what units I should have before I attack, and some of them I had never used, let alone knew HOW to use.

End rating:  4 stars.  I'm having fun, and that's what counts for a retro game.  Minus 1 star since I have to use 3rd party freeware to get it to run in a window or proportioned correctly on my laptop.
