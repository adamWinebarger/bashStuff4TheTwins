Final Fantasy 7 is yet another gold brick in the shimmering castle of Squaresofts frequent triumphs. You will fall in love with the characters, you'll wish you could jump right into the world. The game's events are structured very well(except for the ever-present "level up before the final boss" stage of the game). The graphics are wonderful in their own right. It's just as deep and enthralling as any Final Fantasy should be.
But, to be honest, it's a hassle to bother with the PC version. It's best to get a playstation and play it that way. FF7's system requirements are strict and tend to make the game look and run worse than on the Playstation even if you have a good computer. And keyboard control is no fun at all(ironically, I used a gamepad that resembles the PS controller). And otherwise, this is a striaght port so you're not missing anything if you go for the PS version. But, if you refuse to/can't buy a playstation, this version is better than nothing and you certainly won't want to miss out.
