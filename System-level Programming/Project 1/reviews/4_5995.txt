It was defenitely way too short!

I bought & played this game back when I was on Win95 (use WinXPpro now) and I had no problems whatsoever. This game was fun, exciting, creepy, and kept me wanting more. Even after I found things I needed in places, I was still curious to search more and just poke around. The stories were sad and haunting, but so entertaining. I was VERY dissapointed that this was so short and I have been searching for a similiar game ever since, with no luck at all :(

Still, I don't regret buying this....I mean, it's been forever, and I'm STILL searching for a game that can entertain me like this did! I gave Amber 4 stars only because of game length... other than that, I say, you have to play this game!
