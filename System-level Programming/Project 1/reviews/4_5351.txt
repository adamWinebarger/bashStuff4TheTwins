This game is awesome. I remember getting this game and being extremely excited because it was Rugrats. This really IS a great Rugrats game; the best that has came out. In this game, you can play golf, and even walk around Tommy's entire house and backyard. This is a great game that is a lot like the show. Rugrats in Paris The Movie for teh N64 has got nothing on this game. Buy this for anyone that is a fan of the show.
