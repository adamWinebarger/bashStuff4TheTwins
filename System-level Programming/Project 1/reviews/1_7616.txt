This is not what you'd expect from Rare or from the Donkey Kong series. The game has a really basic plot: The bad croc is going to blow up Donkey  Kong's island. Everyone, including me, was expecting super graphics from  the expansion pack (which you need to play this game). Not true. The  graphics are a bit better then the average game, but not as good as they  could be. The game is remarkably similar to Banjo-Kazoie (another 1 star  game) in that you learn moves as you progress through the game, something I  HATE! The characters also speak in mumbles that get annoying. However,  probably the worst part is that the game play is boring and it is hardly  challenging. I beat the first level fully and almost beat the 2nd through  5th levels in the first week I had it and I haven't touched it since. The  only good part is the multi-player mode. So, if you're going to buy an N64  game, look elsewhere.
