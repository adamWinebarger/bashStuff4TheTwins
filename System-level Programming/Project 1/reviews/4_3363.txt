The battle system could of been a lot better.  Number one: There's too many battles in the first place.  You take three steps you get in a battle.  You walk two steps to get somewhere and you end up in a battle.  You take one step, most likely you'll get in a battle.  Also, let me point out that once you're in a battle, you can't move around.  And plus summoning whatever it is you're trying to summon, like Thunder or something, you have to press eighty buttons just to summon it at once.  It's hard to do.  However, I think that the game was engaging and never let ya go.  It was entertaining, and it is undoubtedly worth the twenty bucks$...but...the battle system could of been a lot better, I'm sorry.
