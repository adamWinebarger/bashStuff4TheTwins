It's just typical.  That's the word of the day, it seems.  Typical.  Too many similar games available these days.  This means you really don't need to bother with most of them, and unfortunately, this is just another game you can skip over if you wish.

While the storyline is good, what you mainly do in Kings Field is walk around with a sword finding items hidden in treasure chests and... no, it's not Zelda.  It mine as well be, though.  Nah, it's not really a rip-off.  I don't know what it's supposed to be, but I think the game was a bit too heavy on finding important items.  It needed more action.
