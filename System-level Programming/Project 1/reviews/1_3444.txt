Soul Calibur is a classic example of all icing and no cake! The game looks great and sounds great, but its too easy. The game that is supposed to be the game for "die hard fighting fans" is basically a walk in the park. The game is a button masher! I played the game and found that "turtling up" and waiting for the right time to attack or throw is all that it takes to succeed and it even works on the higher dificulty settings.
My major gripe about the game is the dark and demonic story lines. No God fearing person should touch this "demon sword wielding" game (I began to discover the different plots after I played it). I'm not trying to sound like a fanatic but come on why all the demon intense plots in a generally evil game. What sick minds came up with this anyway?
If the game had a better plot (one that involved some thought) then it would be a classic, but as it stands...no.
