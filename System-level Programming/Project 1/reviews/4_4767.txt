Diablo is the game that changed everything.  I had high hopes for this expansion.  This expansion was published by Sierra not Blizzard, and it shows.  The install insists on installing bloatware.  The Monk is added to the playable characters, but is not well thought out.  A monk should be a hand fighter, but instead it uses the staff like a wizard.  The special ability, to locate treasure is nice, but because the "search" skill can be learned in a book it is not unique like the trap finding of the rouge, or the smithing skill of the warrior.  The monk is a disappointment.  There are a lot of new items, mostly traps.  Because it adds items, the player does not find as many good items, as it raises the probability of finding them.  I did not find any new quests.  This is a very old game, and while fun, it won't run in Windows 7.  I had to dig out a very old XP computer before I could play it.  I am glad that Blizzard has not allowed other publishers to create expansions since.  I am glad to have played this expansion, but I don't think it was worth the price.  The seller however was wonderful.  I would recommend him.
