Well, I love moving this fast in a vgame. I enjoyed playing in the Tatooine course, and the made-up levels actually seem like real STAR WARS designs, unlike Rogue Squadron 2. Often you're racing through a level, and you kind of want to stop playing....but you don't, because you want to make the next turn, or just love peacefully gliding over the land at that speed. I never got into tuning up the racers, maybe there's something lacking there. You aren't often right beside the other pod, it would have been nice to implement an element of slamming into the other pod to have a fun/dangerous fight while performing the race, if that option were here and was fun, it would provide an all-new level of depth/excitement to the game, maybe if you had to avoid Subulba like the film. I thought I heard there will be a sequel to this game, hopefully they will optimize it for the next-gen systems like Xbox, because they didn't when this was merely ported to Sega Dreamcast. A sequel would make a cool online game, but make they could introduce AOTC areas or make a 3-4 more Tatooine levels. The graphics here are very smudgey, I would advise getting the PC or DC version or something, but it's worth getting as it is so [inexpensive] now.
