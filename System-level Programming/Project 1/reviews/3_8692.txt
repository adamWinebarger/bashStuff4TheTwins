Even to this day DAYTONA USA is my favorite Arcade game. It's still even found in arcades around the world ten years or so after it was released. The arcade may only have 3 tracks to choose from, but it is it's multi player compedativeness that has given it it's awsome fun.

But bringing this game to the PC and Satrun did not bring the fun factor with it. It was pretty much the same game. There was a horse you could get if you won all races in a row (the arcade you actualy got a FWD type of car!) but the fun factow with the PC and Saturn versions where not there. The saturn version was only 2 players if you could hook it up to another Saturn.. and the PC version I think had a network game you could go to using the net, but I never tried it.

It was too hard to control the cars with joypads, and even using a steerwheel joypad if you had one didn't make it anywhere near as much fun as the Arcade.
