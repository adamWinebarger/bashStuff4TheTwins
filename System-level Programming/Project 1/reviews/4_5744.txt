I do love the CROC series. As though this game may seem pretty difficult to play and not have a very good game rating score. But to me i like challenges. This adventure is definitely a one in a time classic. Who cannot love their favorite toony crocodile character in this game. I like him. He's funny and cool. I am not saying this is the best game. I had tough times with it when i was just a child but now it's a piece of cake. I would consider people trying this game.
