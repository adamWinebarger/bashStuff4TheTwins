Sim ThemePark was not what I saw coming. Right when I got it, I popped it into the CD-Rom on the computer. I was so excited! But then, the downside comes along. The installation takes forever. I had to try again to make it work. Then, it takes forever just to get into the game. And when I finally got into the game, the colors were all screwed up. Okay, so I messed with some hardware on the computer, but even after my mom fixed it, they still wouldn't work right!! And whenever I go into the game, it gets stuck right after I click "quit". So I have to restart the computer completely. Since the day I first got this, this game has not seen the CD-Rom. At all. I am looking into Roller Coaster Tycoon, and am hoping that it will work much better than this. Thank you for reading my review!
