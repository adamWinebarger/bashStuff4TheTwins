Metal Gear: Solid - Circa 1998

GOOD:

- Considered a classic PS1 game to many

- voice-overs and sound track are pretty good

- Birthed modern day "stealth" gameplay

BAD:

- Graphics are pretty dated

- Game play might feel a little dated

- The dialog can drag on a little bit

IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:

- Stealth gameplay, with some action mixed in

- Mature and complex story

- Multiple endings and even a few bonuses to unlock

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:

- Tenchu

- Siphon Filter

- Metal Gear Solid: VR Missions

ADDITIONAL NOTES:
