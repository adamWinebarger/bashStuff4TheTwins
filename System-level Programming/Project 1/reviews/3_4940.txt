This game is very fun, while it lasts anyway. The graphics are great, the music is fantastic, the moves are cool, and the levels are cool too. But even though it can be a little challenging, the truth is, the game is just too short. The game is not enough of a challenge, there are only 30 tapes in 6 levels with three competitions, and the game takes no time to blaze through. Even though it is harder to combo, the game often gives you more points than it should. If you're just going after three gold medals, a person could beat this game with two different characters in a day. If you're going for all the tapes, it depends on the person. Maybe a day, maybe two. There isn't much depth to a lot of the gameplay, and it gets old really quick. The length of the game and how easy it is cut two stars off the game's rating. The game had more potential than the hype and what it really was, but for now, and even in the second, it's not much...
