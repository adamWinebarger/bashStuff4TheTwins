Turok 2: Seeds of Evil is the sequel to Turok Dinosaur Hunter that not only surpasses that game in it's greatness but is my most favorite game in the series of four games that came out on the N64. Everything that made the original such a great game to play was improved upon, especially in the way of graphics. With the expansion pak, graphics had 'almost' a Playstation 2 quality to them. It's something that showed with this game. It showed in the textures of the environments, the details of the architecture, lighting effects and other eye candy. The game was also bigger and better than any other game, with the exception of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, in it's 32 meg cartridge. As you've probably read in the courtesy review, it's been stated to have over 45 hours of playtime. While I don't know about that, personally, as I hadn't checked where I stand within the game..one thing I do know is it's one lengthy meaty game to sink your teeth(playtime) into.

While Turok 2: Seeds of Evil stood in the shadow of Rare's Goldeneye during it's release, Turok 2 still stands the test of time in terms of gameplay and is one game every Nintendo fan should add to their collection. If not for the fact that it had a killer storyline and an awesome arsenal of weapons to play with, then for the fact it was an absolute beauty of a game.
