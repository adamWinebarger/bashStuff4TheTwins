PROS:

1. difficulty mode select

2. ability to turn vibrations and subtitles on or off

3. Colorful, eyecatching visuals

CONS:

1. No tutorial

2. No save option if played on PSII

3. No Pause option (pushing select will make you start from the beginning or quit)

4. No level simple enough for younger children - notes can be quick and complex

5. Oftentimes bad music with vocalists that are too goofy or difficult to understand

I picked this up, hearing it followed along the PaRappa games. Familiar with the others, I I conquered this one - only having to do 2-3 songs twice.

At first, the songs are clear and catchy, in my opinion. But the last half really disappointed me - the lyrics became difficult to understand, and the voices were either too goofy or grainy to rely on them for help with the beat. Additionally, the songs themselves were musically displeasing and I found myself wanting to hurry up and get through a song just so it would be over.

In conclusion, I think it's a fun game for people who like the music-based style, but not anything special. Buy it used and cheap if you wanna play it - like I did.
