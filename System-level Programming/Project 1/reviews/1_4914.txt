Well, it won't work at all. I put it in my console, and nothing. I looked it over carefully to make sure I didn't buy some...knock off, but it even has etched trademarks, ext. It doesn't recognize the disk at all. So I went to the Activision site to see if I could find some help on this game. And this is what they said...
Problem
Does not load and play.
Solution
Activision has identified a manufacturing problem with regards to its Dreamcast title Blue Stinger. The manufacturing issue involves only a limited percentage of the total product available in stores, but will result in start-up failure on certain Dreamcast systems.
If you experience this problem, we encourage you to call 1-888-402-8951 and The Blue Stinger Hotline will send you a new disc free of charge. You will be asked to return the faulty copy of Blue Stinger directly to the fulfillment house. A prepaid, self-addressed mailer will be provided for their convenience.
Activision is dedicated to promptly delivering replacement discs to affected consumers. We would like to extend an apology to you for the inconvenience, but are confident that once this problem is corrected, you will have an outstanding gaming experience with Blue Stinger and the Dreamcast hardware.
So, I just wanted to post this for anyone else that has this problem, or will have this problem in the future. So far I have only got their answering machine. Let's see if they are still supporting this title and call me back:o)

UPDATE:  Talked to someone from Activision.  He was kinda floored that there were still faulty copies out there:o)  Guess it's been awhile since it was out.  Anyway, they replaced it as promised.  But, the games really [stinks]!!!  Don't bother.  It's been a while since I even had my Dreamcast hooked up, so I don't remember what it was that I didn't like about the game.  But, I do remember that I knew this was a really bad game in about ten minutes of playing it.  Wasn't even worth my time getting it replaced.
