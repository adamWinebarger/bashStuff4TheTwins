The only reason I gave this game two stars is because I am an Mortal Kombat Fan but this game sucks!!!  It was way to easy you know I loved mortal kombat trilogy because it was hard as h*ll and when I beat it I was so happy and said to my self I can't wait till the next game!!!  Yet this is just bad you don't even have to learn the peoples moves any more.  You just have to take out your weapon and hack'em to death it just sucks. Then I went and rentid Mortal Kombat:DA and I do admit harder then this peice of $h! t!!!  Yet still the weopons are still there and now you can stab them in the gut and leave it there so the person you fight slowly dies.  So what I'm saying is stick with 1,2,3 and Trilogy they are way better.
