I was in high school when this game came out. I saw the commercials. I was little confused about the title (what happened to Final Fantasies 4 through 6???), but the game looked cool. I wanted it.

I did not have a psx, though. However, my best friend did. A week after he bought it, he invited me over, and he showed me the game. I was hooked by the time Cloud and Barrett rushed off the train.

I had to have the game. It was like no other Final Fantasy. The characters and the environments were so vivid... so REAL.

I left my friend's house with a burning desire to own this game and the knowledge of what had happened to Final Fantasies 4 through 6 (or Final Fantasies 2, 3, and 5).

After a few months of saving I had enough money, and I bought the Playstation, a memory card, and Final Fantasy 7.

All in all, the game kept me riveted until the very end. The presentation was incredible. The story was intriguing. The game, for me, was an absolutely breath-taking experience.

Really, the only turn-offs for me were a handful of instances where the translation was confusing and some weird instances of homosexual innuendo (honestly, that was more comical than detracting).

By today's standards, the graphics are dated, but I still play through this game from time to time, and I thoroughly enjoy it every time.
