The idea is clever: build a supertower for people to play in, shop in, live in, and attend cultural events in.  You can build up or down for up to 100 floor but I've never managed to get enough elevators to really do that.  And no matter how many cleaners you have and how many stairs you have, everyone will start complaining about something fairly soon.  It really needs more options in terms of transportation overall.
