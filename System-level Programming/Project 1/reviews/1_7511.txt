This is exactly what everybody has said already about this game. It's bad... REALLY BAD. The intro movie alone is enough to let you know what you're in for which is a whole lot of crap.

The game only features geometrical shapes and solid colors for graphics. Seriously, it really does look like if you tried to make a 3D world out of construction paper. The controls are waaaaaay off as in if you start running, it's near impossible to turn/stop/maneuver your character and jumping on enemies consists of landing *directly* under your shadow or you will get hit and die. Gliding is a smaller jump that makes you "float" a little.... it's completely USELESS unless you need to use it on those floor-fan-enemies to float up. And the sounds.... ugggghhhh... oh my... atrocious.

But here's the thing about this torture devise... it's entertaining to a certain degree. Now I may be crazy but I bought this just to say "I own one of the worst games in history" but I'm actually compelled to beat it to 100%. A challenge that may result in brain damage but I'm no quitter. If you plan on getting this for the "lolz", get some beer and call a couple of friends over. This is the videogame equivalent of an Asylum movie.
