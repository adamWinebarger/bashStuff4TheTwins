"I am only left asking, "how long until Daikaitaina 2? "" - Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha!
I really tried to like this game.
I felt like screaming "Turn the lights on!" during the first level. What a murky morass. I installed this game twice and I still can't stand it.
What angers alot of gamers is this: We wonder what games didn't get made because "Daikajokea" sucked up so much cash?
