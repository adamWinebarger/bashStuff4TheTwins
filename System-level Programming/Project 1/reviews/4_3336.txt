The story and plot are interesting enough to keep a gamer entertained.  Gameplay is entertaining, but also challenging.
I cannot give the game five stars though.  I had already played the likes of FFX and Xenosaga prior to playing this game.  Their superior visuals and certainly the inclusion of voice-acting made the experience more enjoyable than FF7.  In other words, I would have enjoyed FF7 if I had experienced the game prior to playing more recent RPGs.
