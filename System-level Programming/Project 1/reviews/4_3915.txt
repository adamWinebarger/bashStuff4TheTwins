THIS GAME WAS GREAT, AS A MATTER OF FACT, BUT IT'S NOT ALL THAT PEOPLE SAY IT IS. THERE'S SOME NEW CHARACTERS ADDED TO THE GAME AND THE CHARACTERS FROM THE FIRST 2 GAMES HAVE ALL GOTTEN OLDER. THE FIGHTS ARE GREAT, THE NEW AND INVENTIVE MODES [SUCH AS THE ONE WHERE YOU FIGHT OFF GANGS AND STUFF LIKE THAT ON DIFFERENT STAGES] ARE GOOD, AND THE CHARACTERS ARE ALL FUN AND EASY TO USE. TEKKEN FANS WILL LOVE THIS ONE A LOT.
