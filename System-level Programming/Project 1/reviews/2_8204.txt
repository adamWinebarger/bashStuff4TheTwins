The digitized actors give the game an interesting visual style, and the levels/backgrounds bear a decent resemblance to certain sections of the movie. As someone who's played a lot of Mortal Kombat I thought the controls were decent, but I can understand how frustrating gadget usage must be if you aren't used to inputting 'special move' commands all the time.

Really, the game just gets boring and repetitive after awhile. There's not a lot to do except beat up thugs, and the 'loading' that takes place between each room kills the momentum and gameplay flow. A lack of continues or save feature keeps you from wanting to jump back in when you die. And beyond the graphics in the levels, presentation is downright bad with bland elevator music and a weird batcomputer display that tries to move the narrative along. Plus what kind of game do you have when the manual doesn't even list how to jump down between floors in a room??

2-player co-op does make the game a bit better, until you either get stuck or get bored. Overall, another dud Batman licensed game.
