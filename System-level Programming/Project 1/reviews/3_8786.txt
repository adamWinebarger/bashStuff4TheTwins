This game has a lot of good things going for it.

The graphics were really great for its time, and even now still look good...at least on the main characters.  The story, while not great, is still far above the average for a videogame.  The same can be said about the voice acting.

And probably most importantly, the game is *fun*.  Or at least it starts out that way.  By the time you get a 3-4 character party, the game's horrible AI and pathfinding are irritatingly obvious.

For starters, you have the choice between your allies sitting there doing nothing while you're in a fight, or them running off on their own through half the level in search of something to fight (and biting off more than they can chew and dying).  Babysitting them is extremely tedious, especially when you switch to control one from running off on his own, only to have another one do the exact same thing.

Pathfinding is awful.  Going around a corner and through a door and getting your entire party to go along is more difficult than any boss in the game (and some of them are fairly difficult).  On top of it, your allies will buff themselves with every spell they have (consuming blood...one of the resources you have to maintain at a decent level or suffer bad consequences/death) at the sight of so much as a rat.  There is an option to make it so they only auto-cast from a short list of spells (that you choose), but apparently the option is bugged and doesn't work.

In the end, I found it easier to go through a level with just one character. I left the rest behind, only using them to store equipment and for boss encounters.  That's how bad it is.

It's a shame because the character advancement system is very customizeable, and I would have liked to play the game multiple times to try things different each time.  However the annoying AI has sapped any replayability the game might have held.
