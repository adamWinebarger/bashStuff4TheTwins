What I expected was another Total Annihilation, but obviously I was at err, I don't know who made this game but if it was the original design team of TA then they were smoking somethin that made pretty colors dance across the screen. Ok, bottom line, TA kingdoms is by far the worst possible  stradegy game ever! It is SO slow on my P2 450mhz computer( after I got  about 50 units or so) it was ridiculas! I mean it was like watching your  units walk through glue because the game slows down so bad, it took my  little army of 30 units 15 minutes to reach the enemy base! Also 3D  acceleration for this game is non-existent! In the original TA the computer  cheated, but it wasn't to an extream sence, here they made it ten-fold!  Whenever you aren't looking over the enemy's base, they make units in 3  seconds or less, they can make thousands of units with only one lodestone  in place! its ridiculously IMPOSSIBLE in skirmish(when you are just getting  your defences finished they will have those plus a 30+ army coming to  attack your base) and just plain weird in campaign mode. Do not buy this  game, buy the original TA, its WAY better, trust me. Avoid Kingdoms like it  is a urine cup used to serve apple juice!
