As a collector of older games, I had to get this one since I really enjoyed the three Donkey Kong Country games on the SNES. DK64 is a good game, but it's very frustrating and repetitive. At times, the mini-games and puzzle solving seems impossible to complete. The levels in this game are huge, so expect alot of exploration time.  The Graphics were good for it's time. It plays similar to Super Mario 64, only with monkeys instead of a plumber. The worst thing about this game is most definitely the camera angles. You'll be running along fine and forget that you have to push left C or right C to swing the camera around causing you to fall of the ledge of platform, even with the camera option set to "follow". If you want a game that you can enjoy playing without getting frustrated, stay away. But for those who love challenges, this game will definetly rack your brain.
