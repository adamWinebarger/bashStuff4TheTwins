It's such an obvious idea, I'm surprised no one has thought of it before: a game that plays like a comic book where you are in the panels and each page is a level. It has neat little features like how enemies are drawn into the page and you can choose different paths, but where the game falls short is in the gameplay. All it consists of is punch-punch-kick again and again; it gets old and doesn't allow for strategy or skill. It also doesn't help that the story and music are weak, not to mention that this game is atrociously difficult.
