Well, that's what CGW editor Jeff Green called "Unreal". After playing it, I'm inclined to agree. It incorporates (on a small scale) elements of adventure games, which slows down the first-person action  without actually adding much weight to the alleged story. It does look  nice, though, at least for a 1997 era game.
