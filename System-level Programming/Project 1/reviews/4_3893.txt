How do you know if the Dreamcast is the system for you? Forget about graphics, think about the games!  If you love arcade style games, this is the system for you.  Some of the best ports include Soul Calibur, Gauntlet Legends, Street Fighter 3: 3rd Strike, Marvel Vs. Capcom, Daytona USA: Network Edition, Mortal Kombat Gold, House Of The Dead 2, and the list goes on.  If you prefer role playing games and more adventure oriented titles (even though Dreamcast does have a few good ones), you may want to get Playstation 2 as it offers more variety in that catagory.  The only bad feature about the Dreamcast is the controllers...they break down often, especially if you constantly play Capcom's 2D fighters. Plus, I think it was a bad idea to make the VMU slots on the controllers rather than on the system itself, it just seems awkward.  As for the durability issue, I can't really speak for that yet.  What I can tell you is that I have had mine for well over a year now, it has endured extensive play, and has yet to display any noticable overheating/overuse problems.  I haven't heard of any problems with the Dreamcast breaking down as of yet...but be careful.  Give the vents on the right side of the Dreamcast plently of room to blow the hot air out.  If you want to get a Dreamcast, hurry up, it probably won't be around much longer thanks to the Playstation 2.  Fortunately, the Dreamcast has already established a solid library of games.  Get it now while you are still able to find games and accessories easily.
