I have always been a Die-Hard MGS fan so I had to buy this game. It was very appealing at first beacuse the missions deliver a proffesional touch to your/snakes abilities. The proves to be challenging and requires a quick tactical sort of brain.
The game needs to be played bye someone who can devote time to play it also, as it gets very frustrating at certain times. I found my self beating the controller on the floor at times do to having to try over and over and over again to beat a level that is extremely intimadating.
This game would have made a better pre-realease game because it prepares you for the most grueling parts of MGS. So if your a new comer to the MGS series get this game first its ideal for training you for the real game.
