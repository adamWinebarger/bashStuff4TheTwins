When i first played this game last Christmas, for the first time, i thought "oh my goodness, how do you play this! "...this is a  mario game but at that time i wasn't feeling too well and the strange  appearance of the game made my head spin.
As a result, i played tomb  Raider:TLR insetad. Happy to tell you that today, i'd rather play this game  than Tomb Raider.
Well, it's like a board game but much more fun. Lot's  of minigames, lots of chances to shout and swear (not that i'm telling you  to) but it's all good-natured fun.
The characters look kind of silly (esp  Yoshi and Peach who look like circus rejects)but i don't think the purpose  of playing a mario game (or any decent video game) is to see hunks and  babes.
However, this game falls short of Mario Kart replay glory 'cause  the formula can get tired at times.
But if you want a solid first-party  party game, then this is it. I haven't played GoldenEye 007 or Perfect  Dark yet- so as far as pure multiplayer mania is concerned, this is number  2 next to Mario kart 64.
Yes, it's that good.
