Sim Theme Park is Bullfrogs answer to the crown that was stolen from them by Roller Coaster Tycoon ( Bullfrog made the FIRST theme park developer game Theme Park) and comes close but falls short in many ways. First the  good stuff, STP has a fantastic graphic engine which makes the rides look  fantastic. The ability to ride the rides you make and walk through your  park is a major plus. But, the bad part is that the game lacks depth. Beat  the first park and the game is basicly over, you get 3 new parks but there  just the same rides with diffrent looks. The game requires a 3D card and  some hefty space on your computer to run some what smoothly. If your  looking for a great game, with more options and fun, that can run on your  computer no matter what go with Roller Coaster Tycoon and youll be hooked  and love every minute of it. By the way, don't pay 40 bucks for it either,  id sell my copy of it, without the box, just instructions and game for 20  or less. Only get this if your a diehard theme park fan or are looking for  a couple hours of graphic bliss.
