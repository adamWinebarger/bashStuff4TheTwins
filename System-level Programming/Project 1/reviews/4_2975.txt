The hit 1990s game "Myst" set off the immensely popular "Myst" series, as well as "Myst" spin-off computer games. The game is fantasy-based, puzzle game, incorporating unique locations and mechanical motifs. While a bit outdated in some ways, the game is intriguing and fun and well worth buying.

-Plot

You play a character who finds themselves stranded on a tiny island. While exploring, you begin to discover the dark past of the island which you are visiting. Using ingenious "linking books" you can access other islands and unravel the truth behind the lonely, mysterious worlds.

-Environment

The environments, while not necessarily beautiful, are well done. There are a total of five islands, all with different motifs. These islands, or "ages" include:

-A world with half-sunken boats and flooded tunnels.

-An age with a spinning building.

-A Cyprus forest with a network of treehouses.

-An odd, out-of-this world island with a gigantic tunnel.

The environments can be rather dark at times. In general there is little character interaction, leaving the player dealing mostly with puzzles and exploring.

Music drifts in and out of the game, with some locations dominated by the sound of wind while others have music in the background. The music alternates between very dark to dark tinged. While the game does not have catchy tunes, it suits the game quite well as background music.

-Characters

There are few characters, and interaction is limited. There is a selection of journals in a library which provide interesting reading and histories of the various islands.

-Puzzles

This game is a puzzle game. The puzzles are generally mechanical in nature. The puzzle solutions can be illusive, but puzzles are generally not incredibly tedious. Once you have solved puzzles once, they can generally be solved again quickly, allowing you to replay the game without worrying about coming to mounds of impossible puzzles yet again.

If you enjoy puzzles that involve common sense more than mathematics and like interesting and unique worlds, you will enjoy "Myst." The game has decent replay value. The game is rather old, and an updated edition called "Real Myst" is available on Amazon. However, for a genuine piece of gaming history, the original is the way to go.
