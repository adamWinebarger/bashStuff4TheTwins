Soul Edge - Circa 1996

GOOD:

- Gameplay is pretty balanced

- Some nice unlockables

- Different and interesting story for a fighter

- Pretty good sound track for a fighter

BAD:

- Graphics looked pretty dated

- Voice-Overs are not so good

IF IT FITS YOUR TASTE:

- Play story mode to unlock new swords characters and costumes

- Plays like Tekken, but with weapons

- Medieval Theme has Ninjas and Samurais fighting Pirates and Knights

GAME ITS MOST ASSOCATED TOO:

- Tekken 2

- Virtual Fighter 2

ADDITIONAL NOTES:

- This is the first game in the Soul Caliber franchise

- In the arcade this game was called Soul Blade
