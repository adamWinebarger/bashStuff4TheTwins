man, i remember getting this game when i was around 9 years old, and alll those hours i spent beating this game over and over again. I Gurantee I've beaten this game at least 100 times, Honestly! Though the N64 is outdated, from time to time I take it out of my closet and plug it in just to play this game. I hope the twilight princess will be just the same!
