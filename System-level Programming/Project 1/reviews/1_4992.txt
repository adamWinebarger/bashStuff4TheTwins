This game sucks ass. period. The new vehicles are ok sometimes, but all are slow and horrible to control. The new powerups are retarded , such as skis to go over water but at an even slower pace by 5 times. The old vehicles, and kooky characters are all gone, as is the storyline and anything else fun from the original. Oh, by the way, this was also made by a different company, which is the reason for all this horribleness. So , in summation, stick to the first on e til they come out with a 3rd one on a new system.
