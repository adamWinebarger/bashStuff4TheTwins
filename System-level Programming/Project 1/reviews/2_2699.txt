Duke Nukem is a pretty cool series.  I use to own some of the Nukem Games...I happen to buy this game along time ago at a game store called GameMax..They had it for 4 bucks...It was pretty sweet.  The graphics were terrible but Hey it was on the Play station.  The game play was kinda slow but still good.  I don't know if this is and edited copy of the game...I can tell you is that in this version I got for PS1 you do see women take there braws off when you pay em' cash..But they have stars...Literaly covering there nips..And it also has a type of color...The one that matches there bra..
The games violence is over the top.  But still it's a winner...I happen to like the N64 versio more then this even though there isn't Brief nudity like The ps1 version But in the N64 version there is more violence...The bodies explode when you shoot them again after there dead.  You can't do that in the PS1 version but that doesn't really matter.
Duke Nukem Total Meltdown is recomended for a mature audience since this game does have over the top pig exploding violence plus you go to an Adults Only Book store and there are half naked strippers with stars on them.
I had fun with this game.  It kinda pissed me off cause you didn't get to do all the stuff you can do in the PC version But I still liked it.  Over all it's a mediocer version.
I do not recomend this version at at all!  Get the PC version!  Or the N64...I donno I just liked that version.
It's a great Duke Nukem Game...
Later...
