Its fun for the first 5 hours but it gets really boring really fast. The graphics are poor and theres no real plot or storyline to it. Its very annoying to have cops on your tail and its really hard to get the the next level. The entire game is filled with pointless pictures of people pointing guns at you just to fill up space. Its a pretty cheap.
