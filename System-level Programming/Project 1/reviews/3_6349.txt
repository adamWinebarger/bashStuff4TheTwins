I made the mistake of installing this before I was finished with the original Roller Coaster Tycoon, and it replaced all the old scenarios with the Cork Screw Follies scenarios. I could not find a way to go back and play the old scenarios, so I had to start with these. That alone really upset me. I thought there might be new coasters and things to research for my existing scenarios, like other software companies did in their add-ons. Also, there's still no option to create your own open ended scenario.
Aside from eating my old games, Corkscrew Follies isn't bad.  It's nice to have new scenarios and things to do, and the game play didn't differ from the original. the graphics are still like the first, a little cartoony but still fairly good.
Overall this isn't a bad add-on, but I was sorely disappointed when it took away the original scenarios.
