This game is just sickeningly good and nothing else since has matched it's gameplay, depth, charm, design and atmosphere. It is absolutely flawless and perfect.
When it came out 3 years or so ago i was hooked to it immediately and i finished it in about a month. But since then i finished it around 10 more times and i still enjoy playing the full game today after 3 years! It is that good. The controls are absolutely perfect and the targeting system works perfectly for most combat situations.
 The atmospehere of the levels of the game is just the best ever in a game to date. For example in the mysterious forest the Lost Woods, u can actually feel it's mystery from the excellent music getting louder as u reach it's source and the way the whole place is designed.
No videogame fan has an excuse not to play or own this. Words cannot describe my love for this game. (Sounds stup[id but it's true) You will so nostalgic even when u meet the characters again for the 20th time. It is just a gaming masterpiece and i doubt it will be bettered for a veeeeerrryy long time to come unless the new gamecube zelda follows the same direction and improves it with a larger interface and new fresh ideas.
BUY IT it or u will miss out on the best game ever. yes the best game ever..  all i can say is if u haven't for some reason BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT BUY IT...
