This game is will go great with the add ons. But i love this game with Gordon and all the other civilians and scientists and security.... But this game has very cool weapons and very cool monsters. But this game is not reccomended for young users because of major violence and gore. And Multiplayer is a blast. BUT DONT EVER GIVE AWAY YOUR CD KEY IF YOU DO YOU MAY NEVER PLAY HALF LIFE MULTIPLAYER AGIAN! Dont even copy the cd for your friends. But this game has everything i expected with excellent graphics. Everyone will enjoy this game im sure. But 4 stars is my rating because i cant give anything 5 stars unless its AWESOME AND HAS NOTHING WRONG.
