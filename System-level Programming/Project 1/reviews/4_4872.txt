I've been a huge fan of King's Quest for a long time(I think it was the  first game I played that actually had better than monochrome graphics on my  286x)
The first three games are the best (which is odd, 'cause their  graphics are the worst by today's standards), four and five are pretty  cool. Six and Seven had cartoon-like graphics, but didn't seem to have the  adventurous feel of the others. The first one is still the most fun, and  they even added both the old, classic version and a newer version with  better graphics!
If you've played either Space Quest, or Police Quest...  you'll get an instant feel for this one!
