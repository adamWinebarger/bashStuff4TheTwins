There's a ton of first-person adventure games out there thanks to Myst, but there's nothing wrong with that!  What matters is if the game is enjoyable to play, and in the case of Amber I'd most definately say  yes.
Amber: Journeys Beyond is a first person adventure game with  somewhat simple graphics and animation... but at the same time the plot and  story hold your interest.  The premise is that you are 'checking up as a  favor to a friend' on a woman who bought a haunted house so she could study  the paranormal.  She uses a headset called the Amber device so she can  observe the ghosts and actually travel in the spirit realm.  When you find  her she's in a catatonic state, trapped outside of her body with no way of  geting back.
Your job is to help your friend by guiding the other spirits  in the house to their final rewards by either helping them realize that  they're dead, finding an item that they lost, or helping them finish  something they never completed in life.  There's three people you need to  aid before you can help your friend, and no particular order in which to do  it.
Although the game is only on one CD, and the graphics are simplistic  Amber is still an impressive game for the value.  It has enough ambiance to  make the hairs on the back of your neck stand up more than once (imagine  walking into the bathroom and seeing words write themselves on the mirror).  Amber can scare you, but it does it in a subtle way instead of shoving a  bucketload of gore in your face.  The gameplay is a bit short, but still  much more than you'd normally expect in a single CD game.
If you want an  inexpensive yet interesting adventure this is the game for you.
