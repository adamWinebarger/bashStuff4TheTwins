this game was good it actually has talking in it you don't have to read everything its pretty difficult in a way that its fun and its not too short there is a story-line to it the game works great no unable to read disc errors or anything like that

the only downfall is that if you have Pac-man world 2 for GAMECUBE or PS2 you going to be slightly disappointed because Pac-man world 2 is way better
but that's just my opinion

great buy
