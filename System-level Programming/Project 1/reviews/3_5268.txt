I had never played this game before I bought it (2011), so I didn't really know what to expect besides that all of the reviews I've read are horrible.  I bought it because I am building up an N64 collection and have always been a big South Park fan, but there have been so few games.  For this reason, I was pretty pleasantly surprised at how much fun I had with it.
  The game is set up like a mix between Mario Party and Jeopardy. You can pick 1-4 players. Each player has to buzz in and then answer a question. Some of the questions are about South Park specifics and others are general knowledge or things that practically no one would know. After the questions you go into mini-games, which there are a good number of (for an N64 party game) and which are all actually pretty fun. I even got my wife in on this, who is not a fan of 64 or SP, and we had a great time playing it.
  The graphics are about the same of any N64 games of this time period, think along the lines of the SP FPS game. The Audio, both character voices and music I found to be great and humorous. Controls could be better because you don't really use the analog stick, but didn't take away from the game. Remember, as with  most N64 games, the replay value is not going to be all that high, especially with the types of games out now. If you're looking for the ultimate party game, Mario Party 8 or Kinect Dance Central is probably a better bet, but if you want some nostalgia and a fun South Park game, this will do it for you.
