By now every man, woman andchild has heard of pokemon, and it's reputation.  The cute little animals you catch in a ball and then force to fight eachother has captured the hearts of kids in America, and the wallets of parents.  Many people hate this game with out even giving it a try.  Why is that, the overly priced, merchandice, the barbaric card game (banned in many elementary schools and pre schools nation wide) and terrible TV show and average movies...  When looking at all the [stuff] it's easy to forget the concept, and enjoyment of the game itself.
The game is an RPG, meaning experience building and random battles, all in a quest (in this case) to become the best.  You have a rival (who you name) and the two of you compete through out the entire game.
because this is on Gameboy (before Color) the graphics are dull, plain, boring.  However after getting past that you have a very deep, very fun, and very addicting game.  Catching 151 of the creatures (151 through either gameshark or Pokemon Conventions) and in these cases it is a little difficult to put the game down.
Overall the game is worth playing because it is a lot of fun, forget the [stuff] that it spawned and play the first game, if you are an RPG Fan you will not be disapointed.
