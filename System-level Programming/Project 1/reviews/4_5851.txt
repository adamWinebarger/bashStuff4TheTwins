Some people may think that Monster Rancher is a stupid Pokemon clone with absolutely no entertainment value.  They are very wrong.  Monster Rancher 2 is one of my favorite games.  You start out by either going to the market and getting a monter or regenerate one yourself by going to the shirne and using a "disc stone" (CD).  The main object of the game is to raise and train your monster.  You have to decide which stats will benefit your monster the most in a battle.  Some monsters are better at some stats than others.  For example, a Durahan has wonderful power and defense but awful speed.  One feature that I really like about this game is that it never ends.  To actually beat the game, you must beat the Major 4 tournaments, the hardest in the game.  Once you do that, it doesn't stop.  You can combine monsters together to make even more powerful ones.  Some monsters aren't available at the start of the game, but they can soon be unlocked.  The only drawback is that MR2 does get somewhat repetative, but it's still a great game.
