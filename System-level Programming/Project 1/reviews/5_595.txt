This game is a lot of fun, with a creepy atmosphere that revolves around the disappearance of Agents Mulder and Scully. I've heard some complain that they wish Mulder and Scully were in the game more, but I think you  still see enough of them to keep most fans happy, plus I found the  character of Agent Willmore (whom you play) to be very likeable. The  storyline is very strong, the puzzles make sense, and the full motion video  (FMV) sequences are very good. There are not very many FMV games around  anymore, so if you like your adventure games with video sequences, this is  really a "must have".
