I remember when I played the demo for this game. It was brilliant - you could stealth around, you had to be startegic and the atmosphere 10 times as tense as any other game ever. You had to loot a mansion and you could pick up some jewels for yourself as well. You had to AVOID making a comotion. The use of sound and light (or lack of them) was excellent as well. It was one of the best levels of any game I had ever played.
I got my hands on the full version and rushed through the first level, eagar to see what theivery lay ahead. When I started playing the second level I found myself making my way through a haunted mine where I had to avoid zombies, kill spiders and eventually free someone from a prison. The whole thieving aspect had been taken away, and not only had degenerated into a standard cliched fantasy hack n slash affair, it was a BAD hack n slash affair. The next 2 or 3 levels were the same. Yes, you had to be stealthy, but not in the same context. I never played on - I had no motivation to.
This could have been one of the best games ever, but in attempting to appeal to the mainstream (lets face it, the thievery aspect wouldn't have sold well on consoles) they messed it up, and they didn't even do the "it's-been-done-before" bit well. At least if it was done well it could have offered some short-term enjoyment (albeit forgetable) so that I wouldn't have completely wasted my money, but as it is it was a missed oportunity. Doesn't even deserve the tag "Thief" most of the time.
