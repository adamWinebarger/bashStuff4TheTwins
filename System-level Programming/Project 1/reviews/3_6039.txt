If Dreamcast is the only system you own then by all means this is a must have for MK4 fans. However the presence of the new fighters are not enough to constitute a new game. The characters that were not in MK4 bring with them their signature moves to this Sega Dreamcast version, but their weapons have the same moves and fuctions of the already excisting ones. Also the throw moves and bone breaker moves are already owned by MK4 original characters. As for the new fatalities, nothing new either. The MK4 fatalities are some of the best, but the new ones are not impressive here. Save your money if you already own MK4 for Sony PS1 or N64. If you do not own any excisting versions, the needless extras don't hurt I guess.
