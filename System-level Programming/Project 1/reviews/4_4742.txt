StarCraft is always fun, although you start getting bored with the same  old sprites after a while. The balance of three different races is great,  although you'll have to download patches for the latest game balance  (necessary for Internet play). Gameplay itself is easy to get a grip on,  blut very hard to master. Still, the game allows players to just build up  big, powerful units and bulldoze to victory.
