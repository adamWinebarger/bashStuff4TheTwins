This game has everything it needs to be GREAT! It IS great. I've never played Croc 2, scared off by difficulties in the first one. Yes, I agree, the controls are horrible. I can remember spending 7 minutes climbing platforms only to miss a cage, jump down, take 5 minutes back up, and fall down right before the top. <SCREAM> It made me even madder because the characters are the cutest, you collect things like Spyro and Ty, it's the cutest story, and I WANT to play it so, so badly...but the diificult controls make that impossible. For "Greatest Hit" couldn't they have fixed that ONE problem?? If they fix the camera/controls and make Croc 3, I will pre-order it.
