I had a positive but more negative experience with this game. I did beat it a few times at the final level, defeating Bowser. But, the game crept me a couple of times. I could not fully control the buttons on the controller in order to figure out where I (Mario) was. Plus, there were some enemies that were scary and immortal. I could not stay in the water for too long or else I would die. However, the game was the first 3D Mario adventure type with cool graphics and so.

I rank this game the second in the list of most difficult Mario games (maybe 5 as total) ever. The winner is Super Mario Bros. 2 (in my opinion).
