It's a game.  But the acting is no worse than the movie so I give it one  extra star because you can do stuff, not just sit there and watch the  lousey acting. "Qui gon, I have a bad feeling about dis"  Well,  it's kinda fun, I guess. You get to whack things with yer light-saber which  sounds much like the movie and the other sound effects/background ambience  are excellent in my opinion.  Music even better.  Gameplay OK.  Graphics  are not the best for now but very good for 1999.  You want a good Episode I  game, try Racer.
