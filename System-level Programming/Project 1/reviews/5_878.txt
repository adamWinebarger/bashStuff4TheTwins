i played this game when i was about 15, and i'm now 24 and still love it to the death (literally). I have a blast shooting other things other than just people and watching bullet holes go into the items and how it looks so freaking real. I also have always loved how you can choose many different people in 2 player mode, such as 007 to scientist. The golden gun is the coolest because it only takes on shot to kill, but if you like a really smashing good time, you can always punch or cut your way out. A must have game for the 64 :-)
