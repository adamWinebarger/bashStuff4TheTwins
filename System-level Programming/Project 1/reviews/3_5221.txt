This game is very interesting. I never played Warcraft 2 for more than 30  minutes before I bought it. I really got into it. But then you play the  second race. They are the same. If you want to play this and Starcraft.  Play StarCraft second, so then you won't find this one at times mundane.  Yet it still gets kudos from me. Just play Tides of Darkness and Beyond the  Dark Portal with your favorite LOOKING race. Take into consideration the  annoying Orc voice. Still good. Does not need to rely on graphics.
