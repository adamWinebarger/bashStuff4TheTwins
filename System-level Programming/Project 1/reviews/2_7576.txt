Quest 64 is a Role Playing game that stresses 3d eye-candy, with little depth of story, plot, and no long lasting appeal (all three are essential, along with others, for a good rpg).
The main character only has one weapon and a few items which most of which repeat themselves in a pattern throughout the entire game.
There are no side quests or red herrings to keep you intrigued, no easter eggs.
The battle system first of all is the most boring turn based combat system ive ever seen.  Oh and youll spend 80 percent of the game running around the countryside fighting monsters to build your levels (thats all the game's empahsis is on, building levels) and thatll bore you after about a couple of hours, off and on.  The game's story seems to get loss in the building of levels after the first few hours or so.
The amazing 3d graphics are the only thing really good about this game, as its the only thing that really keeps it from getting one star.  But still graphics don't make up for a game with such a linear monotonous flow.
I recently re-read some of the previous Nintendo Powers reviews of this game hyping it up as being as good as Final Fantasy series....that was a selling/promotional point more than anything else, since as the first editorial writer above said, "Quest 64 sinks in too many areas: (to paraphrase him).
If you can find this game used at a exchange store for 5 dollars nowdays then I would buy it, thankfully I only rented it and the guide, rather than pay 50 bucks for this game when it first came out, you should do the same.
