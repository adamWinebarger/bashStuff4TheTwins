I really love this game that is quite similar in concept to Super Mario 64. Though it is a lot simpler than its successor Banjo Tooie (in that one there are many types of eggs plus you can change characters) but it is a lot more fun. The successor had a lot more dialog that you had to wade through.

The final battle with Grunty is one of the toughest obstacles I have encountered in a video game and I still have not figured out a way to beat her without the unlimited gold feather cheat.
