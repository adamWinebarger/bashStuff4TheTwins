First off, let me clear up some misstatements about the features listed above by amazon.com:
*Realistic 3-D environment
Wrong. The game is 2D, it merely looks 3D. It IS realistic, however. There is far more detail in  2D than could ever have been done in 3D and still hae it run on everyone's  machine.
*View cities from up to 50,000 feet
I guess...you have 5 zoom  levels. The above implies that you can zoom to any level.
*Detailed  control over businesses and other facilities
None whatsoever other than  being able to zone blocks of residential, commercial, and industrial areas,  along with other specialized zones. You can't micromanage any individual  businesses.
*Everything and everyone moves
Cars and SimCitizens move,  so do some animated buildings, but certainly not EVERYTHING.
*Optional  load-in sets for customization and enhancements
That's handled much  better in SC3K Unlimited.
SimCity 3000 is a mixed bag for me. I love  being able to play a fully updated version of 2000, but whether it should  be called 3000 or 2100 is something of a dilemma.
Graphics-wise, 3000 is  beautiful! No two ways about it. A lot of hype has gone into the fact that  you can now zoom in and see little sims walking, driving around in  individual cars, and so on. The building images are now fully 4-sided  entities so that rotating the view yields 4 different looks at each  feature. Five zoom levels let you choose the size you're comfortable with  to build on. Some people claim that the buildings are blocky and pixellated  at the highest zoom. I don't have that problem, but they are definitely not  the crisp renders that the other 4 zooms are. They are merely enlargements  of the 4th zoom. Vehicles and pedestrians remain crisp and distinct at any  zoom.
Gameplay: here's the sticking point for me. If you've continued to  play SimCity 2000 until you're red-eyed and guaranteed to be late for  work/school, you'll probably do the same with 3000. Given all the new bells  and whistles, it'll take some time to try them all and see how this affects  that. From this point, however, two camps emerge. One camp will continue  playing the game for years and loving every minute of it, relishing the  freedom to create anything they want. I fall into this category. The other  camp, once having seen everything and mastered building megalopoli at will,  are going to wonder what's the fun anymore. So depending on your  expectations for the game it'll be either a gift from heaven or something  you may well have wished didn't cost 40 to 50 bucks.
As for difficulty,  it's no harder really than 2000. Some of the new features like garbage  disposal, ordinances, and neighboring city dealings add depth and strategy  without making the game unduly complex. Maxis should be commended for  that.
Overall? It's good. In fact it's very good. They put a lot of work  into it making sure everything balances more or less. Is it worth the  money? Not now with SC3K Unlimited out. Get it instead, as it's much more  refined. If you haven't played a SimCity game before or if you're a diehard  2000 fan, absolutely. If you just sorta liked 2000 and quit playing it  after a little bit, you may want to wait until it hits the bargain rack.
