Syphon Filter is a good 3rd person shooter with stealth elements.  People have to remember that this was one of the early 3d games that tried to incorporate stealth elements, so it is not as smooth as some of today's games, but it is still pretty well done in my opinion. The game has its flaws, but was a very fun game and the difficulty was just right.  Not too easy and the boss fights were pretty sweet and did require multiple attempts on my part.  I have the disc version for the PS1, so I cannot comment on the digital version.
