One of the very few Nintendo 64 games that I have ACTUALLY mastered. Rampage 2 is a fun game to play. First, you get a choice between six (6) different destructive creatures to go from city to city to smash & destroy buildings, vehicles and consume people. You get the option of 'saving' the game you're playing right at every five games. Starts out in Denver and you go through what I would guess like about 100 cities in the US, UK, Europe, Asia and Australia before hitting Area 51, the Moon and a couple dozen planets and asteroids. Note: the wolf moves the fastest while running through a city and the rhino seems to be the most ruthless. Also, if you hit the L button, the blue button and the Z button at the same time, you'll see that each creature puts out their own special fifteen second source of damage. Only downside of this game is it MAY be to easy for some. Recommended.
