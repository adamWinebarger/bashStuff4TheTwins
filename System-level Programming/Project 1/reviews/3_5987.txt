I was always a fan of MK.  I always felt that the first MK gave the best atmosphere, and the sequels killed that aspect, instead adding more characters and 'neat' moves rather then the Goth dark horror I perceive the MK universe to be.  This game steps back into that style, with a feel for what is truly behind the characters, and the meaning behind the tournament.  However, this game has some bothersome aspects, like too few lives, too precise timing required (especially in the second stage with the windmill platforms), and too much to guess at.  Over all, this game is better then average, but could have used a little more, in controls.  A good buy, for MK buffs.
