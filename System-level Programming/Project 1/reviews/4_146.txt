The video quality is fine but if you have your hdmi plugged directly into your tv and have a separate receiver for audio, the cables are way too short to fit in both, so right now if I want to use the better video signal, I have to use the tv audio. I'll try to rip open the cables to make them reach but this is really a design flaw, although many newer receivers have hdmi connectors on them, there are a lot that don't.
