oh my gosh this game is not a good game I gave it three stars for 3 reasons I was gonna give it 2 but then i decited it was a good game to goof around on. Its glichey and the plot is appearentally superman trying to find the right wedding ring so he does what any other superman does and flies through them. The cartrige I got was crappy to say the least. It was loose and the back label was gone and the front one was almost the same way. I works fine. I would recomend this game to someone who is not "super" serious about gameing and likes to waste time. If you want a better synopsis of the game check out protonjons lp of it, its.pretty good,well as good as this game can get.
