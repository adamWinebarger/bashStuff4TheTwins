The initial buzz regarding this game was enormous, leading some publications to regard it as the best videogame ever. But hindsight shows that the title simply hasn't aged well.
For starters, the plot is void and simplistic - seen a million times before. The game is also overly long, and the puzzles get old fast. For a similarly themed game, "Deus Ex" outdoes HL, as it actually delivers on the promise of realism. In other words, the gameplay adjusts to you and not the other way around.
Possibly the strongest point about HL is the mod community built around it. Mods are addons which can be downloaded off the net for free. Although the quality of the singleplayer mods leaves much to be desired, the multiplayer mods are often spectacular, as is the case of Day of Defeat and Counter Strike.
My advice is to purchase it SOLELY for these mods, provided you have a good internet connection, so that you may spend many sleepless nights playing the various realism-oriented mods available.
