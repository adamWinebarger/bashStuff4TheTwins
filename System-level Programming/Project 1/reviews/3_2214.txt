I used to play Cruisin USA a lot back in the days of great arcade gaming and I was excited to hear that it was headed to the Nintendo 64. This port though is really for the die hard fans of the arcade game it is based on because the good qualities of the game do not outweigh the bad qualities.

The Good Qualities: This port includes all of the cars, stages and music featured in the arcade version. The controls are spot on so you were able to get into this game easily. It even includes the secret cars by hitting certain buttons at the select screen such as the bus.

The Bad Qualities: This game was one of the first titles to be released soon after the Nintendo 64 made is debut and it shows. While the graphics are crisp and bright, they were also choppy at times during gameplay and this game was one of the first to feature massive "pop up" graphics: graphics that suddenly appeared out of thin air. While the arcade game suffered from this as well, it wasn't as bad and the overall draw distance was better than the N64 port. The digital voice samples along with the audio in the N64 port were muffled; it sounded like it was playing out a paper bag. The cars controlled in the same way so there was no difference in what you picked to play during the stages.

If you were a fan of the Cruisin arcade series, be warned that this is a decent port of the first title in the series and like the first arcade game, had little variety in the control of the cars and the stages. I like arcade racers so that is why I give this a 3 star rating. Peace.
