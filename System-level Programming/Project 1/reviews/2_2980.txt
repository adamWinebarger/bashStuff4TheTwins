This game continues to haunt my memories as an irritation because of it's length and puzzles, which usually amounted to no more than treading back and forth across the island of Myst.  While the environments were increadibly beautiful, they fail to make up for the miserable gameplay, which has you go to one place at least 5 times to solve five different puzzles.  The story is intruiging, yet the game's ending fails to please the player, since, you'll discover shortly after completing it, it could be completed in a matter of minutes.

A good game for 10 to 20 dollars, but you shouldn't spend more than that on this weekend game.
