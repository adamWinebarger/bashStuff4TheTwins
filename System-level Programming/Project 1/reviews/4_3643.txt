Makers of RE bring us : Dino Crisis  The graphics, musick, backgrounds do look pretty good! You play a redhead babe Regina and have to blast your way through all these blood thirsty dinos.. It gets hard at times, but after you play it a few times, you'll be all set.. This also has decent replay value as well, you get more costumes, and an infinite grenade launcher, so you can play again and blast all dinos Regina's other costumes are really cute as well, especially the cave-girl one, and she looks  yummy! What else can I say? DC is worthy of purchase although it's somewhat on the mediocre side. RE fans will like...
