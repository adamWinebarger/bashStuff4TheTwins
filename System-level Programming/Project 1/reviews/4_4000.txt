Words cannot describe.
You need to feel this game. Cringe as Pai floors  you with a double toe kick and mercilessly follows up with a jumping knee  to the midriff. Cheer as you fight back with a spinning kick as you get up.  You nimbly dodge the next kick and fire off a triple punch combo, finishing  with a powerful backhanded punch to win the round. Watch it on the replay,  go on. Laugh at Shun's ever-increasing drunkenness. Memorise that sweep  kick movement. Gape as you realise fighting games do not have to feature  blazing blue fireballs and Super Hyper Alpha Combo Breaking Double EX  Special Level Three moves. Instead, here's a fighting game where the  feature is actual fighting! Crikey!
So, why only 4?
Get to about...  oooh... Level 7. Battle relentlessly until both characters are nearing the  end of their tether. Open your attack and watch as the opposition stops it  and fires one back, knocking you out. Pound your controller through the  floor while screaming "BUT-I-PUSHED-PUNCH-THEN!"
Recover from  that bout of frustration, continue the game and realise that when you're  not frustrated you're having incredible fun. Read this review. Go to the  store. Buy the game. Do it now.
