I liked being a Cocoon Master. I liked hearing old legends told by the voice of the old wise man. And I liked a RPG who deals with respect for environment. When I accidentally slayed some minions I really felt sorry. And I had a lot of fun merging those funny little beasts. Buy it, if you are tired of the usal 'fight the evil one' RPG.
