Goldeneye has to be one of the best multiplayer games ever.  I still play this game against friends even though i have a ps2 now.  The graphics are still ok to look at, even though i have seen far better on dc and ps2. It has excellant replay value and is very challenging to defeat on all difficulty settings.  Pick this up if you want the best fps on n64.
