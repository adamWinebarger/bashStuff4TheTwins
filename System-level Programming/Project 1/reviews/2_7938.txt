To say the least, Donkey Kong took everything this genre stood for, and made a muck-up of it. Endless item collecting, muddy details and slow action leave this one for the chimps, uh, chumps.
You have bananas, golden and coloured, coins, coconuts, ammo, musical notes etc. and for five characters. The collecting seems endless, and when i was forty % done the game, i just stopped. I looked at this forest level and i said, this looks just like the desert and water ones, only with a different backdrop.
And what's with the story? Some giant floating island or something? Why does K Rool have such a loathing for the Kongs? WHy doesn't he just butcher them instead of placing them in unguarded, easily escapable places???? Rare really messed up on this one. The sound isn't all that awesome (the DK rap, what the heck was that?), and the graphics were bleh; this thing required the 4mb expansion? Banjo Kazooie looked twice as good.
Even the characters are lame. I thought the release of Kiddy Kong in DKC3 was dumb, but now we have three new characters that couldve easily been replaced by 2 old ones. Tiny is the spitting image of Dixie, and Lanky is the babyish side of Kiddy while Chunky is, well the chunky side.
I think Rare thought their game was weak themselves, that must be why they added this mediocre 3rd person shooter multiplayer, isn't it? They didn't think they did a good job on the shooter part did they?
I have so many peeves about this game, it's nuts. What difference is tehre between the gun and the instrument??? They both unlock things. Why did Rare feel it necessary to have two things that can work switches??
Honestly, the only entertaining and redeeming part of this game are the Jetpac and Donkey Kong hidden arcade games.
Certainly a long game, but length is not always a good thing. Look at Conker's BFD, it was short, and still owned this game wicked bad. 15 hours of this, and you'll wish Rare had stopped there.
