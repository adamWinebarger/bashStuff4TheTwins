Its a nifty little console, however, it makes a really menacing grinding noise whenever its loading a disk, I'm not sure if that's normal because I've never owned a Dreamcast before, and It also sounds like the internal cooling fans are having a hard time cooling it. I'm glad I made the purchase, however I am uncertain of the longevity of its life.

It arrived in a medium sized box, and it had like, 20 layers of saran wrap on it, which was kind of annoying to peel off, but I suppose it did its job in keeping the console safe, and the console itself is only a little bigger than the controller.

I highly recommend this console. I gave it a 4 because there's a few errors with my console, but only minor ones, like having to reset the internal clock EVERY TIME I turn it on, long loading times on games, the grinding noise, which I might add, my PS2 started making before it died, and the cooling fan. I feel like I should also add that it had a bit of trouble picking up the controller the first time I used it, but that was easily fixable.

Overall its a great console that I would recommend to people who want to experience some history in gaming without the loss of content from an N64 cartridge.
