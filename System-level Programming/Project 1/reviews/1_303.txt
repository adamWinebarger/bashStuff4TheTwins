It works only when wanting to, I thought it was initially cause the console was old, so i purchased a new one last week, and it acts the exact same way. sometimes it loads up, sometimes it don't, sometimes it loads up but says its unformated, others, it says it doesn't have enough space for a save, when it has more than 90% of the 128mb still available. and also sometimes it will say no memory card in slot available.  This is so worthless, I think I'll rather use this for a databank sort of holder, and just play off of a normal 8mb one, copy and pasting within the ps2 browser option, cause this is to frustrating to deal with on a regular playing basis.
