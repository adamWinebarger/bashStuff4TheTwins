As I have mentioned before in my past reviews, I did not and will not buy Resident Evil 2 or Resident Evil 3 for Gamecube, I just don't feel like they gave the fans what they could have given them. In the fact that Resident Evil Remake, for Gamecube, is far better than the original Resident Evil on PSX 1.

That out of the way, let's slip once again into the Survival Horror genre with Resident Evil 3. To be flat-out-honest I loved this game from begining to end. Never once did I find myself annoyed or slowed down with any problems while playing this game. The graphics and sound are not much more than Resident Evil 2 gave us BUT the game itself seems to flow seemlessly with RE 2 in every aspect.

I feel that Capcom hit the nail on the head with this game as they did with Resident Evil 2... heck thus far they have done a real bang up job making these games. In closing all I can tell you is that not trying Resident Evil 3 would be a mistake... as the game has everything in it that you would need for a heartpounding experience of fun.
