What a poor excuse for a Final Fantasy game, this game should have never came to america. Sure, the graphics are great but the characters make me sick and the plot seems like it came right from a Baby Sitter's Club Book. The main character Squall is suffereing from teenaged agnst, please. Oh, and the magic system (the draw and juctioning system- great idea... ahahahahahahaha. If you want a GOOD Final Fantasy get 7, 9,and 2, or 3 ( 4 and 6 for those people who think that they know Japanese.) Just stay as far away from this game as you possibly can!!!!
