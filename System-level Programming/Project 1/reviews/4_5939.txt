Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver was one of the first games made for playstation and to this day is still one of the bestSoul Reaver follows the story of Raziel, a badass vampire who's trying to get revene on his former master Kein. Raziel must travel through the spectral realm and the real realm defeating 9 vampire tribes to get stronger and defeat Kein. Wgat makes this game fun is the fact that you can go anywhere you want at anytime. Also the graphics were way ahead of it's time. The fighting is this game is amazing, you get to use Raziels brutal vampire attacks and you can use spears which can either throw for a one hit kill or beat the living crap out of your enemies. The bad things about this game is that there is absolutely no sense of direction in this game. I had to refer to the internet man;y  times to figure out where to go next. Also I heard that the ending sucks. I never beat the game because I couldn't get into Keins lair at the end. This game has a few flaws, but as long as you have a strategy guidej, it can the funnest games you'll ever play.
