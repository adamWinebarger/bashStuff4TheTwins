Castlevania is a darkly digital adventure into the Gothic world of the Dracula legend.

 There's the ubiquitous Vampire Hunter, this one's name is "Richter Belmont", a 23 - year old mortal hunting the Lord of The Undead, estimated to be over 400 years old.

 Richter's 17-year old girlfriend, "Maria Renard" goes looking for him, & is, of course, captured by Count Vlad Tepes Dracula {sic}; so she ends up presenting an additional problem / obstacle for Richter.

 These magnificent creatures so easily beaten by inexperienced & pathetic mortals? Please.

 Obviously, the philosphical theme is that of the "Good vs. Evil" simplicity, but remember, it is just a game, after all. There are some idealistic disturbances, such as werewolves being slaughtered, & of course, there's no real choice of actually being Dracula Himself, or a demon, for that matter, but the player does get an opportunity to battle, & even kill them.

 Alucard, Dracula's confused & ingrate son, is an option, however, he has the same type of mentality besetting 'Nick Knight'; that is to say, unappreciative of the magnificent being he is, & the Dark Gift bestowal.

'Death' {Thanatos} makes a special appearance, giving Alucard a dire warning, & ends up making off with his weapons... he he he.....

 After some brief scathing philosophical arguementation, in which the Dracula character makes a rather good point, the battle begins, amidst the triumphant & haunting strains of an organ.

 Castlevania comes off as being a 'cross' between a movie & a videogame.

 Castlevania contains magnificent scenery, & some pretty damned good music.

 One major warning: Watch out for Demons!
