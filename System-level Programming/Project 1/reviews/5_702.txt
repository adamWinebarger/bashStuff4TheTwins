I have always been a FF fan ever since 2 was out. I've been loving it ever since and was glad that i played this. Let me tell you about the game:As you have probably found out from other reviews, it is about a rebel orginization named AVALANCHE who is saving the planet from Shinra Inc., who is polluting the Earth. One of these members is a man named Cloud, a 21 year old guy who was in a orginazation called Soldier, which is the army of Shinra. Possibly the greatest plot and climax I've ever seen. Great battles, they proved to be a challenge. Cloud, Sid, and Red 13 are my favorite charecters. Also some of the best movies in a game that i've seen for a long time. Espeically the 11 minute ending. Man that was good. ENJOY!
