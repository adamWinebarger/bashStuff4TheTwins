I have played this game again and gain and again.  it has an wit and humor about ti that makes you laugh along with wonderful charecters and a diverse and suprising story line.  puzzles are moderate in hardness and the whole thing is like a movie.  I felt my self saying aww in dissapointment when it was over.  (i wanted to keep playing!)  I LOVE this game.
