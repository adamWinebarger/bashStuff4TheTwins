I just bought this game a few weeks ago,and it's awesome. It just has that "This is going to be an epic game" from the get go. It has great graphics,even to this day.

First of all,this is an Action Adventure,not a RPG/Role Playing Game.

Next,I recommend buying the Strategy Guide. This game is what gamers call "Nintendo Hard". It's a challenging game,with quite a number of puzzle parts.

Anyway,buy it if you have a 64,or Virtual Console it if you have a Wii.
