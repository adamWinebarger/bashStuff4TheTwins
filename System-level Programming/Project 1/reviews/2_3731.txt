Resident evil 2, may i say, is one of the best games of all time.  So was re1, re0, and re code veronica.  But not resident evil 3.  First of all, whats with the difficulty mode?!!  U either put it on easy and it starts u with enough ammo to finish the rest of the game with, or u put it on hard and it makes it so u barely have enough.  But the worst part is the tyrant.  It chases u so u barely have a chance to explore.  It literally follows u through doors and into new areas constantly!  He's hard to kill and always comes back.  Plus he can kill u in one or two hits and is fast.  It takes away from the fun of the game.  Forget this game and try resident evil 2 or one of the others..... you will thank me later.
