I like the direction Sega took memory cards. At the time I really thought it was the future of controllers and memory cards. I might've been half right I guess. I would give this item a five star if it weren't for one thing that I really don't blame Sega for. It uses a lithium battery and for some reason mine always seemed to die before I even noticed. It's too bad Sega had some good ideas that were just harder to execute at the time.
