When I received this game I opened it up and right away started installing it, but wait in all the excitement i didn't notice it being in the cardboard CD holder and because it was the installation wouldnt work why? Cause the CD was scratched beyond repair. Good job Interplay. I will right another reveiw when I receive my new package telling you if the game is as bad as Interplay's packing job.
