This may just be my personal preferences, but here's what I think about Riven.

The graphics are beautiful, stunning even...but not as beautiful or stunning as those in, say, The Legacy of Time.

The puzzles are thought-provoking, but they can sometimes be difficult or impossible to understand simply because you don't know what you're looking for: there's no internal logic to the puzzles. In, say, the 7th Guest each puzzle has a clear goal, and a clear set of rules/guidelines/parameters.

The worst problem, though, is that it's lonely. I just find myself wishing for more people.

My recommendation? Borrow it from a friend or rent a copy from a video game store to see whether you enjoy it before you purchase it at full price.
