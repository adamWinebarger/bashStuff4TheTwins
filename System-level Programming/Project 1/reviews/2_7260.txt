Mortal Kombat dominated arcades and home consoles worldwide, but did it dominate handhelds? No. No it did not. The Game Gear version was fairly good, but the Game Boy port suffered from really slow gameplay, dull music, and no sound effects. The graphics were okay, but it didn't help keep the Game Boy version from getting a fatality.

This is possibly the worst Mortal Kombat game.
