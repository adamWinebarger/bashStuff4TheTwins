When I first started playing this game, I was awestruck by the amazing graphics.  I installed it, everything ran smoothly, and even though the tutorial level was extremely long, I didn't tire of it simply because  everything was so impressive looking, even at the meager 640x480 res I  started at.
I played the campaign next, and although it was pretty cool  that you had the same resources and ships from level to level, the levels  themselves were extremely easy (I know that because I suck at RTS games and  I didn't have to reload once on this one).  It also was boring having to  collect every last scrap of resources at the end of the levels in order to  support your fleet through the next threat.
Even through all of this, I  thought it was a very fun, addictive, game, but when I started playing  multiplayer it dawned on me where this game really lacks -- there's not  enough variety.  The ships aren't varied enough, and even though it's 3D,  there's only one terrain type -- space.  There's just not enough variety  for it not to get boring after too long.
So even with the stunning  graphics, compelling music, and simple but effective cutscenes, the  un-intuitive gameplay and the sameness of it all brought this still very  good game down to only 4 stars.
