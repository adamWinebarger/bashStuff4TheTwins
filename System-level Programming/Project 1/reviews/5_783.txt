I've looked all over for GoldenEye for my old school N64 but never could find it. Then I found it on Amazon, this is a nice change from the all digital world of FPS games. The graphics are not bad, but if you plan on playing this on your HDTV I would recommend getting a converter that takes the VGA ( Yellow, White & Red ) cables an converts the VGA signal to HDMI so you can play on your High Definition TV. Played this on christmas with the relatives an they were having a blast. Didn't think they would considering it's N64 an not Xbox ONE.

Just playing the game gives you a view of how far technology has come, it might be old an not as detailed as some FPS games but still gives you a perspective of what technology used to look like back in 1996 when the N64 was released. Today this game remains a favorite among gamers. If you have kids & a N64 id take the xbox away for a day an have them play N64 so they can see where & how technology has taken Gaming. Just don't let them play 007 GoldenEye, have them play Diddy Kong Racing.
