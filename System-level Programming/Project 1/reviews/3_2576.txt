Out of all my friends, I must have been the last kid to get this game. I was not regretting it when I asked for it and got it for Christmas, because this game was so cool at first. On Christmas day of 1998, I must have played this game all day. In three days, I had all eight badges, and enough to take on the Elite Four. It took me a little while to beat them, I did. And that's when I got sick of the game. The thing is, after you beat the Elite Four, what you have is a group of superpowerful Pokemon that can only fight wild Pokemon, and you need to catch the rest of the Pokemon. The game becomes a big nothing. It's fun to raise low level Pokemon if you still have trainers you haven't fought, but besides that, it's a pretty big nothing. All you can really do is fight wild Pokemon, walk around, get lost(Which is hard because the game's map is too easy to figure out), and go shopping for items you probably won't need. I have never gotten all 151 Pokemon, because it gets so boring at around 120 that I can't stand it. The game is fun if you use cheats like starting off with Mew and multiplying items, but besides that, it's pretty boring. I'd say to buy it, but the fad is over now, and nobody cares. Playing Pokemon these days makes you an outcast. Only buy this if you're not afraid of ruining whatever reputation you have.
PS: Don't say my review was helpful just because you're an angry fan. I get that a lot. If you didn't find it helpful, that's when you criticize my review, but otherwise, just don't say anything.
