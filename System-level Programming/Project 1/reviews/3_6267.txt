This Game Boy Color light does a good job of magnifying the screen and lighting up the dark. But the thing is, the batteries run out too fast, and the light keeps getting dimmer the more the battery runs out making it useless about halfway through. The screen also smudges a little too easily. It's a good item to have for night travel, just make sure you have a fresh pair of AAA batteries.
