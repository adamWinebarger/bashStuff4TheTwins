To modern eyes, this adventure is bound to look somewhat primitive, but just like a good text adventure, its evocative storytelling transcends technology for those who can get beyond the dated graphics and movement  model.
It is a point-and-click game, with a little too much  point-point-point-point-aha!-click, and it suffers from mild  adventure-itis, but there are some downright spooky moments, and great  ambient noises which build and maintain an atmosphere.  Here we see one of  the adventure game's basic flaws (inability to render sentient characters  realistically) used cleverly to create a "haunted" feel. We also  see one the adventure game's primary strengths (the ability to compel the  reader to piece together a story) used to good advantage.
A good one for  late at night with all the lights off and the headphones on.
