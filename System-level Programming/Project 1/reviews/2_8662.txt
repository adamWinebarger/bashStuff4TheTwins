Initially "Saga Frontier" is quite interesting, but unfortunately it quickly bogs down from there.  The game offers seven different characters in seven different stories (some of which are actually quite interesting); this is a very neat idea, but the action gets repetitive after exploring the same area in different stories.  The fight action is interesting at first, but this too gets repetitive in a rather short time.  One thing I did like was the backgrounds; some of them were just beautifully rendered.  Unfortunately the character/monster graphics just did not fit in with the background; they were two different styles that just did not mesh well with each other.  If the game had offered a better combat engine and more unique areas for each character, "Saga Frontier" would have been a pretty good game.
