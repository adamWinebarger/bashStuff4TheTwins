Fallout II, while falling short of the original Fallout, or the squad based Fallout Tactics, is still a fantastic game, definitely worth a look. It plays similar to the first installment, but boasts better graphics and richer character dialogues (The two things going for it.) I recommend purchasing the dual package, which contains both Fallout I & Fallout II. It is worht the price for the first alone, and the second is a nice bonus. Four stars, highly recommended.
