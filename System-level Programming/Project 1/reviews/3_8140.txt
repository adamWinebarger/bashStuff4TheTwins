This game was obviously created quickly for the N64. It has good potential, but was not used in the creation. The best part of the game is the options. You can choose your truck, track and purchase items to  "beef" up your truck. I have to agree with other gamers who said  it was Cruis'n USA with dirt tracks and trucks. It has the same annoying  game control and graphics! I returned my Cruis'n just after I bought it. I  kept Off Road however. It is still somewhat fun to play just to see how  beefed up you can get you truck. Bottom line; If you are looking for a sim  type racer, don't waste your money! But if you want a racer that the whole  family can play(even little people)and have fun, this is not a bad game.
