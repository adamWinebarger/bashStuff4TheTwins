Believe me, I would give this game zero stars if Amazon.com allowed me.
I received this for Christmas as a gift and let me tell you.  This is possibly the worst piece of garbage put on the market.  I mean, the questions run out fast leaving the game to replay old questions which are easy once you get to know them which means the replay value isn't very high.  If you want a fun game try the Sims or Delta Force: Landwarrior.  Your time would be better spent with those games .
