You know, when i first saw this i thought it looked like Sim City, which i think is a ok game but it gets so boring and after a while it gets dumb. But I went over to my neighbor's house and saw Roller Coaster Tycoon for  the first time. Its awesome. I'm Going to probably have to force myself to  stop playing it though because its so addicting. You just always want to  add more on to your park and get more guests. In the game your given  levels. Each level has a challenge. They give you a certain amount of  money, (sometimes you can add on loans), and a certain amount of time to  get so many guests and have a certain rating for your park. In the ride  department you can choose from either pre-packaged things or build your own  roller coaster's, trains, monorails, log flumes, and more. You can also add  restaurants and mostly anything you can have in a theme park. Also, if you  keep a level for a certain amount of time you get more attractions and  rides and restaurants. The roller coasters range from regular wooden, to  steel, to one support steel, and any roller coaster you can think of, its  awesome. It may be a strategy game, But its better than any shooter or RPG  that i've ever played. BUY IT!
