Hello, i must say this card does just what it says, it holds all of my PS2 game saves, i have always wanted to use one "Memory Card" for all saves. The card holds 128MB and after saving all my saves i have 110MB left and i have well over 60 Playstation 2 games, it`s like having a "PC Hard Drive" in the PS2 and now that i know the card really do work, i will be ordering quite a few more before they are no longer in stock. It does not take much to make me happy and this makes me very happy, now i must get more PS2 games, i have 2 PS2, 2 PS3, 1 PSP, 1 Tablet, 2 Laptops and 2 Desktops all for gaming, i love gaming and proud to say i am a 56 year old gamer, started in 1992, love it.
