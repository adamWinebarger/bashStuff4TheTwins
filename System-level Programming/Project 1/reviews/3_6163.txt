This review will be cut very short. the graphics are good...very good...but not many graphics cards can handle it on middle graphics resolutions. Gameplay is OK. It gets boring after a while. Basiclly this  game was over hyped, and you'll need one heck of an internet connection to  run this game smoothly online. Don't expect this game to hold your  attention for a long period of time.
