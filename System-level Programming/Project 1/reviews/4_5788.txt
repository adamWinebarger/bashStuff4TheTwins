When it comes to the Playstation there are games that have improved when they were remade for the Playstation 2 and there are games that look and play far better in the Playstation 1 version and Tetris Plus is one of them.  Unlike Tetris Worlds where you may get different modes of the game it didn't feel like I got as much to offer or only so much of the feel of Tetris when I tried this game for myself.  On the other hand Tetris Plus had the more colorful classic mode, the puzzle mode with 100 different puzzles not to mention the option to create and try your own puzzles and the vs. mode to test your skills against another player and all had the exact feel and challenge of tetris as I remembered it.  If you want a tetris game for your Playstation this is by far still the better choice.
