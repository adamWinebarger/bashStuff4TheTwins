I have to admit I've been a bit of an Unreal fan in the Quake/Unreal debate over the years. Sinlge player wise, mulitplayer and engine. I prefered Unreal to Quake 2 single player but liked Unreals bright graphics  better. Quake II Multiplayer was the nuts!
When Quake 3 came out I found  I had played the Unreal Tournement Demo more when I first got that!  It  doesn't detract from a great game but any game I can complete in one  evening (on level 3), leaving me wondering if I can be bothered to do it  all again on a higer level, doesn't warrant a classic game for me.
The  engine is the best ever and the bots are gorgeous as is the level design.  It just lacks the cutting edge that UT has and I'm still playing that now.  I do go back to Quake 3 to make a change to UT but having completed it in  one evening I really cant be asked to go all the way back and do it on a  harder setting - The lastability just isn't there. Still a great game  though - just not as good as Unreal tournement (demo!) HA!
