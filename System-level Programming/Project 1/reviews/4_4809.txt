Sins of the Fathers (first game): While primitive-looking by today's  standards, this is a surprisngly deep and compelling game.  The characters  convey actual personality (from Gabriel's machismo to Grace's waspishness),  and you can't help but be swept up in this story of voodoo and destiny.  Even the midi music is pretty cool, though it might drive you insane if you  stay in one area too long....
 Beast Within (second game): A  full-motion-video game that shows you just how good the format can be.  While I didn't care so much for the guy who played Gabriel, everyone else  (especially Grace!) did an incredible job.  In this game Gabriel has  accepted his heritage, to a point, but won't accept help from Grace.  Not  that that stops Grace (little does).  In this game, you switch between the  two, as they work on the case from both ends (I found myself enjoying  Grace's detective work more than Gabriel's good ol' boy attempts at  sleuthing--though both are fun). Werewolves, missing Wagnerian operas, and  dead Bavarian kings all combine in an enthralling story that sweeps you  along, impatient for the next video clip.  And the music...both the opera  itself and the incidental music set the mood, and immerse you fully in this  epic.
