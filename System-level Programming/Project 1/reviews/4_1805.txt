With the release of Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back, Naughty Dog took just about everything from the first game and made it better.

Graphics (9/10) - The environments in this game look spectacular. The great use of color and detail, and the flat shading on Crash's character model really blend well together to make a game that aged very well.

Sound (6/10) - Similar to the first, the music in this one is average. It fits the game well, and each song does a good job representing each stage it's in, but the tunes were very unmemorable for me.

Gameplay (9/10) - The single greatest addition to the gameplay was the ability to use the analog pad on the Dualshock controller. That alone makes the game control much smoother. Other than that, the game plays just as good as the first.
