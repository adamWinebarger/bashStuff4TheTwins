Without a doubt one of the worst games I've ever played. There is no creativity or excitement, nothing that makes you want to play more. You fight the same, boring enemies over and over in large numbers. All they do is bum rush you or occasionally throw a snowball. The AI in this game is a complete joke. Music is horribly forgettable, overall sound is okay. Graphics are bland and level designs look like they all were developed and programmed in a weekend. Each main character has a bit of in-game dialogue, and it quickly becomes repetitive and stale. AND DO NOT GET ME STARTED ON HOW ANNOYING THE TURKEY SOUNDS ARE.

Once you peel away the South Park appeal, there is very little left to stand on its own. I endured playing this for maybe 20 minutes before shutting it off out of extreme boredom. I can see why nobody ever talks about this game. Let's leave it that way.
