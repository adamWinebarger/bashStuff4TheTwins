Let's sum up what is great about Dreamcast:  Sensational graphics (equal to PS2), great sound, good controller design and an excellent, although not outstanding, software line up.
Now, what is so bad about the Dreamcast that I would rate it so low ------ Sega Corporation!!!
If you haven't heard the announcement yet, Sega will not longer be making the Dreamcast console.  This means that the chances of many more great new titles being developed is low.  I am basing this statement from my experience with the Sega Saturn.  Once the Saturn production was stopped, only a handful of additional titles were released and very few stores stocked them.
When I saw that Dreamcast was based on DirectX (the same programming API as Windows for the PC) I was very excited, because I was sure that there would be a flood of titles for the Dreamcast.  There are many more titles for Dreamcast but the flood of PC cross overs never materialized and the few that did come (Urban Chaos, Rainbow Six) were bad.
Now Sega has given up on their console and wants to make software for other companies.  I believe that Sega owes it's gamers a little more loyalty than it has shown and I hope that the gaming community reacts by not purchasing Sega software for any platform.  My investment in a PS/1 was good for 5 years.  My Dreamcast lasted six months.  Goodbye Sega purchases forever.
