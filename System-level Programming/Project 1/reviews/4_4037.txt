Sonic Adventure is an instant Dreamcast classic that shouldn't be missed by any Dreamcast owner.  The game features Sonic in full 3d with newly detailed level enviroment.  This was one of the first games to launch with the Dreamcast and is still one of my favorite Dreamcast game.  The game features a brand new system called the "Chao system" you basicly take care of them and show them new moves it's very simple but you'll need to have a VMU card to do it.  The game features more then 5 playable characters.  The story in the game is very lame if you ask me they could have done better, not to mention the english dubbing is terrible so just stick to japanes language and english subtitles.

I'll make this short and sweet for you.  Sonic Adventure is the best sonic game ever and has great levels, awesome 3d levels and lots of things to do but personally I wanted to beat the storyline instead of that whole chaos thing.  I'm going to make this review short and sweet...

Good

-Great Level desighn

-awesome 3d graphics of Sonic for the Dreamcast

-Lots of playable characters which is really great

-the new Chaos growing process, but I really didn't do it I just play the storyline..

-Superb fast pace action

Bad

-horrindess english dubbing

-the cutscenes look horrible even the ingameplay is better then the cutscenes

-Some really bad camera angles ruin the fast pace of this game

-I kind of wished it was a SONIC ONLY adventure...but ohwell

The ugly

-Robotnick..ehehheh

Overall Sonic Adventure for the Dreamcast is an instant classic packed with full 3d enviroment and Full 3d character model and fast paced action with some really great music.  Some things like camera angles ruin this game and some really bad english dubbing makes it even worse!  But overall this game doesn't dissapoint Sonic fans and that is why I'm giving it a

4.2 out 5.

This is still in my opinion the best Sonic Game ever but it was ruined by some flaws...Great game overall though..
