It is no fault of the shipper but, MYST "WILL NOT work with Windows 7" so now I have a game that I cannot play. I am not sure if that is posted anywhere through out the purchasing process. But that is not what matters as I was the one who should have paid better attention. My own angst and irony have required me to post a 2 star rating.
