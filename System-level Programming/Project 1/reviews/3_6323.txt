There's a lot to like about Final Fantasy VIII coming out of the experience of FF7, but there's also some things not to like. I admired the more realistic and correctly-proportioned characters in the game, but disliked the final battles and the preparations needed to have some chance at the final conflict.
All RPGs tend to have super bosses and lengthy final battles, but the story itself wasn't compelling enough to make me really want to care, or really curious, to bring the game to its conclusion. FF9 and FFX both have been a lot more compelling in this respect.
