Years before Michael Bay's would-be catastrophe came along, turtles ruled the world.  They ran all the industries that mattered; comics, TV, movies and games, like this one.

Based on the 90's cartoon show, the objective of this Game Boy title is simple: Rescue April O'Neil from the Foot Clan using one of the four Turtles.  With 3 basic attacks at your disposal, you fight your way through 5 level filled with ninjas, robots and floating boxes of pizza to replenish your health.  Though enough grunts are thrown in to increase the challenge, you can beat the end bosses wearing your ninja mask backwards.  On the off-chance you do use up our heroes, the game ends.

Besides changing the limited control scheme to one's own taste, the player also has the option to choose whichever stage he wants.  So you can either play through the whole thing and get the full cowabunga experience, or skip all the way to the end for near-instant gratification.  Kinda defeats the purpose, doesn't it?

Like any 9-year-old, I was obsessed with owning a copy while I could still go out and buy one.  Now that I've tried it after seeing the best that 21st-century gaming has to offer, Mom's cooking doesn't taste as good anymore.
