For those of us who got a PSX at rollout, Alien Trilogy deffinately belongs in the list of all time PSX classic games.  Sure, by today's graphics standards it's not so great but it has great game play.  The best thing about this game is the ambiance - dark, great music, it is a little scarry.  The game is simple to play and control.  Yes, the Doom/Unreal crowd won't like it - not enough buttons and weapons of mass destruction.  No, this is the first person shooter your girlfriend will want to play too.  Acclaim should remake this title for PS2 with more CG story cuts and cohesive plot.
