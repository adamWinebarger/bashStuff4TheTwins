When the first Crash Bandicoot came out in 1996 I was amazed on an old game and game system could have great 3-D graphics and such great game play but it was kind hard. But in this one it's not as hard because you can crouch, slide and crouch jump so you can jump even higher! But the graphics are more cartoonish then they are on the first one. But this one had some levels I liked better than on the first one. YOU SHOULD PLAY THIS GAME!!!
