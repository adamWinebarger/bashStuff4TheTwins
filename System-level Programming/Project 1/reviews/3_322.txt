Buyer beware.
It's a cheap-o piece of junk. Keep in mind that I own a few of these and EVERY one had shoddy soldering. In fact several electrical joints never even received any solder. I had to finish the job myself with my own equipment. Once I did that, they became a great addition to my video game collection. Only worth the price if you don't mind a little project.
