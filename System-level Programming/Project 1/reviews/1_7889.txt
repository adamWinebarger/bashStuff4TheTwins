I wish they would make a Gamecube side-scrolling Donkey Kong effort like the SNES games, just make the graphics better, retain the music quality and make more levels and longer. They included some lovely old games like the original DONKEY KONG arcade game, and a spaceman game for computer. There are big worlds, but that seems just about it. There's a lot of collecting, but the problem-solving is no fun. This series became really removed from it's huge SNES appeal.
