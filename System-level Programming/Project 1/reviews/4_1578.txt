"Castlevania 64" offers you the experience of seeing a Castlevania adventure in a free-roaming, 3-D realm. I have played every Castlevania game right back to the NES days, and this is a good addition to a fine series. This is a great game, but not as good as "Castlevania: Symphony of the Night" for Playstation.
To start on a positive note, there is a lot of depth added thanks to the 3-D graphics. You can roam freely, battle monsters face-to-face, and search for hidden items without the constraints of side-scrolling. The control is responsive, and the buttons are easy to figure out, which is good considering the pace of the game. The 3-D worlds are huge, and are fun to explore. The sound is also excellent. You can hear the clatter of bones, the snapping of jaws, and the cracking of whips clearly, without that horrible distortion that we all remeber from earlier installments.
The cons of this game are mostly technical, nothing to do with the graphics or storyline. First of all, the camera can be a servere pain sometimes. It often lingers when you don't want it to, and the response time for panning and scanning is pertty bad.
The control is good, but sometimes it is clunky when you need to perform delicate movements. I remember the first level when I kept falling into the water and dying when I tried to jump from one ledge to another and missed by one inch. Also, a map would be helpful. Certain areas look the same as others, and sometimes, I cannot tell where I have been and where I am going. But as I said, these are more technical flaws. They don't exactly ruin the game.
Overall, this game is fun, and gives a whole new depth to the long-running series. But as good as this is, "Castlevania: SOTN" for Playstation is much better.
