...lousy deathmatch appeal.  Uninspired, retooled, reused weapons, very un-fun level design, and a shoddy skeletal system for models.  That had to beef up the speed so it would be hard to tell.  Other than that, for some reason it just is not fun.  I do not know what it is, just that it seems the fun had been yanked out.  I played Q1 and Q2 religiously, and was chomping at the bit for Q3.  It got released, I grabbed it, and was very disappointed.  At least other companies put the engine to good use for entertaining games.
