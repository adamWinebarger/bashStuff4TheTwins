When the day I got unreal and tried it, I loved it so much I started calling up friends and telling them how incredible that
game was, the gameplay is one of best gameplay ever experienced
in a game, you are a prisoner in a prisoner vessel heading
to a prison moon believed to be called(the prison ship):Vortex
Rikers. But when the skaarj detect you and pull you on to the once peaceful planet of NaPali, then all goes wrong! your best friend gets eaten by a skaarj, you barely manage to escape a now turned to a skaarj slaughter prison vessel, you reach outside grounds and say this can't be real, no it's not, it's UNREAL!Unreal takes you through 39 heart beating, breath taking missions, where you fight for life to survive, collecting items
like defenses and weapons, travel through temples, facilitys, castles, bases, mountians, journey through what napali has to offer, and end up and the skaarj mothers ship, confronting the queen skaarj.......unaided and alone! I would indenefinetley recommend this game to first person sci-fi fan shooters!
