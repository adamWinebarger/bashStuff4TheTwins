The game arrived on time and worked great.  The problem is it isn't a very good game.  Quake II is a game played just for the deathmatch and only on the PS1 and only if you have analog sticks.  If you want to play some old school fps deathmatch try the ps1 version just make sure you have 4 duelshocks and a multitap.
