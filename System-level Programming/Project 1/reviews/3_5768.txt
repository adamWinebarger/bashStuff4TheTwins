I first played GTA 2 on the PC/Windows 98. When I played it on PSX, alot of things were missing like the rocket launcher, and weapons near the start area, and alot of the voice bytes ( Wasted!, Job Failed!, Frenzy Failed! Busted!) aren't in the PSX version. That's why I like computer version better.
