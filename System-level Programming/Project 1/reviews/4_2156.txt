As with the first there is no save option but it is still fun to see how far you get in this game. Its nice and challenging its just a drag there is no continue or save option here. You can get extra lives though. Like most games it gets easier the more you play it. The graphics are superb and the music is very good too. I just recommend you get the first Star Fox cause that game is longer. You should still get this though.
