Mario Kart on the n64 is an extremly well made game. when one person plays the game for the first time the controls are easy and you don't nead to worry about changing gears. After you get better you can move on to harder levels of play. once you beat the game on 150cc (hardest level) you can race al track in mirror mode (all tracks have opposite turns then their original tracks). the ads more replay value because the game in a sence has new tracks. All the tracks are unique and have varied difficulty levels. they are also well designed.
The graphics in mario kart are bright simple and full of color. the music in the game is not very good but it does not mater because of the great sound effects provided by the characters.
As with all great n64 games this one accells in the multiplayer department. It will appeal to people of all ages. you can choose from 3 different multiplayer modes battle championship single race. The most fun out of all of those is batlle because you go around getting items then try to hit your friends with any item you get. if you hit your'e oponent they'll lose a balloon they have 3 ballons.
This is a party game i would recommend over any mario party game and definitly over didy kong racing. this is a classic n64 game no one shoild be without.
