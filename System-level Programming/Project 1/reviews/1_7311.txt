This game is the worst fighting game ever. You have to press start to change from punch to kick, the players are original, but just damn dumb, and the game is hard. You will be lucky enough to even pass the first person. The graphics are ok, but it's horrendous mechanics destroys any hope for this game, and you can't even change your character if you loose, so that forces you to hit the reset button every time you want to change characters.
