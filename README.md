# bashStuff4TheTwins

- This repo should have a collection of the bash scripts that I wrote for Systems-level programming, as well as some bash/zsh scripts that I use on my home machine for various day-to-day things. Some of them are useful and others... not so much. But there should be some stuff here that might come in handy for you. Good luck with that interview
